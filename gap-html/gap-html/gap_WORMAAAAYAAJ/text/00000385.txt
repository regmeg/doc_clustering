private house.

Ch. LXIX.—19. Respublica .... cessisset. Ad verba, c£

Plin. Pan. 6, 3 : confugit in sinum tuum concussa res publica.

28. Lacum Fuiidani. A Fundane lake, now called Lago di

Fundi, is mentioned by Pliny (N. H. 3, 9). But this lake now in

question was in the city of Rome, near the Mons Quirinalis. Brotier

says there were at least a thousand of those lakes at Bome, which

ought more properly to be called fountains. Murphy. Cf. 1, 41:

Curtii lacum.

31. Re trepida. In this unexpected and critical emergency.

3 2. Arcem capitolii. The relative position of the arx (citadel)

and the Capitolium proper (i. e. the temple of Jupiter) has given rise

to much discussion, some maintaining that the Capitolium was within

the arx, others that they stood on distinct summits or points of the

Mons Capitolinus. Cf. Die. Antiq. under Capitolium. Cic. and Liv.

always say arx et Capitolium. Capitolium seems to be used here by

T. as it often is by others, for the whole mount. In the next section

he calls the citadel arx Capitolina.—Mixto milite, etc., i. e. soldiers

mingled with citizens of senatorial and equestrian rank. Cf. 2, 14:

pars classicorum mixtis paganis.

35. Slmulavere. Falsely claimed.

2. Negiecta, i. e. non obsessa a Vitellianis. Rup. Jgg

says, the thing intended is not so much going down from the Capito­

lium, as going away and escaping from the enemy.

Ch. LXX.—11. Simulationem .... fuisse. He said it was a

mere pretence and show, (sc. his appearance) of abdicating the throne.

Simulationem and imaginem are predicates. Cf. Essay, pp. 14, 15.

12. Cur enim .... petisset. Else why should he have gone,

etc. Compare if yap an, etc. in Greek.—E rostris, i. e. from the

assembly of the people. Cf. 68: sua condone.

13. Irritandis .... oculis. Dat. of the end after petisset :

and so as (or with a view) to attract the eyes of men. Or dat. after

aptum implied in domum imminentem: a house fitted to attract, etc.

Cf. Essay, pp. 16, 17.—19. Togatum. Cf. notes, 1,38; A. 9.

SI. Judicatur. So the Greeks use Kotva of deciding disputes by

arms.—22. Hispaniis, etc. Spain and Germany were divided, Brit­

ain was one.

2't. Utilia. Useful things, like the Greek, with xpni'ira under­

stood. The general rules of Latin construction would require utilem.

Cf. Z. 376, a. But exceptions are not wanting in Cic. and Liv. (Z.

377), and are not unfrequent in T., e.g. 2, 20 : pax et concordia jac-

tata sunt.

Ch. LXXI.—1. Erigunt aciem. Cf. note, A. 18 : erexit aciem. ]gy
