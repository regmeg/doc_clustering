852 NOTES.

117 are at'c'ec' '° denote a sudden elevation from a lov to a high post. Cf,

1, 46: e manipularibus, etc.

11. Jfec .... potentia. Nor indeed is power ever very secure

when it is excessive; a general remark, suggested by the balance of

power wavering between Crecina and Valens, as Vitellius inclined to

favor the one or the other.

12. Simula At the same time (that Vitellius vacillated between

them) they in turn both despised and feared Vitellius himself, who

capriciously indulged, in sudden bursts of displeasure or extrava­

gant expressions of attachment, according to his humor. Dod. makes

offensis and blanditiis datives.

16. Patriae .... reddiderat, but not to the possession of their

estates. Hence flebilis et egens.

17. Gratum is ace, agreeing with the object of approbavit, viz.

the clause, quod .... concessisset.

19. Jura libertorum. Cf. Essay, p. 12. Their rights over theit

freedmen. Patrons were entitled to service, and if necessary, support,

from their freedmen; also to inherit one-half of their estates. Lipsius.

SO. Scrvilia ingenia = liberti, quibus servile ingenium est. Rup.

—Abditis .... sinus. By concealing their wealth in obscure places,

or depositing it in the custody of the great. So Dod. Or. under­

stands by occultos sinus the hands (lit. bosoms) of obscure persons.

Ch. XCIII.—28. Infamibus. Notorious, sc. for their unhealthy

&c. of Italy, His. Rom. vol. 1, chap. 23.

29. Germanorum .... corpora, sc. because accustomed to a

colder climate.

30. Fluminis is objective gen. = bibendi ex flumine aviditas.

32. Sedecim. praetoriae, etc. An increased number. C£

note, 1, 20.

33. Quis . .. inessent. In which there were to be, when the

levy was complete. They were now being enrolled (scribebantur).

The subj. here denotes an intention, not a fact.

35. Sane. In truth; justifying in some measure the claim of

Valens. Cf. note on sane, 1, 12.

38. Unde .... fluitasse. Crocina proved a traitor. Cf. 100.

118 XCIV.—T. Convuisum ... decus. The order and beauty

of the praetorian camp was destroyed, viz. by the very same means

which withdrew from the legions and squadrons abroad their main

strength.

lO. Q,uod .... bellassent. Observe again the force of the

subj. to denote the reason assigned by the soldiers.

14. Hberti priucipum. The freedmen of former emperors,

who, as belonging to the state, passed from one imperial family td
