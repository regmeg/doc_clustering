STYLE OF TACITD8. 25

opinions; touching his learning, his fidelity, and his skill as an histo足

rian. But now, since I have no other purpose than to write a preface

to my edition, I have briefly discussed some subjects and have passed

Dy others, particularly those which it is evidently better to omit, than

to treat briefly and therefore unsatisfactorily. And it is better that

those who start such questions should consult those books, (and they

are not a few), in which the ideas of men of pre-eminent talent have

been ably and fully unfolded. But concerning the style of our au足

thor I have treated a little more extensively, in order to compensate

for the small number and briefness of my notes; and, at the same

time, if I should seem to have used too great boldness in either ex足

pressing an opinion or making a correction, to defend my position by

bringing together under a single view the scattered examples. For

this I have chiefly labored, and not with the more ambitious aim to

set forth a sort of image and picture of the style of Tacitus. Who足

ever shall undertake this, will find not a few who will repeat to him

ihese lines of Goethe:

Nosoituro, descripturo, quod animo et vita viget,

Hoc tibi providendum est, animum et vitara ut evites prills;

Proinde partes exanimatas fecili tractabis munu.
