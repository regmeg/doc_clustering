them than him. He exasperates them by arraying before their imagi-^y

nation the terrors of a public execution.—Postulentur. Subj. imply­

ing the fact, instead of directly asserting it. Render by the ind.: are

demanded.

22. Promisit. Given promise, furnished an example. The

reader will notice the train of bloody and dismal words that follow:

trucidaverit, horror, feralem, etc. Feralis is a poetical word. Cf.

Boetticher's Lex. Tac.—XJt qui.... trucidaverit. Cf. note, 29: ut

qui ... discam. Vt qui is not used by Cic, but utpote qui. Cf. Z. 565.

24. Solam victoriam. False. Cf. Suet. Galb. 6-8.

25. Decumari. The practice of decimation, i. e. punishing every

tenth man of an offending body of soldiers, unfrequent in the early

history of Rome, became not uncommon in the civil wars and under

the empire. The victims were drawn by lot. Ann. 3, 21. For the

fact here referred to, cf. Suet. Galb. 12; and note, 6: trucidatis ....

militum.

26. In fidem acceperat. Venire in fidem alicujus, is to surren­

der to his discretion, to submit to his will, and accipere in fiaem is to

receive such submission. See a parallel passage, Ann. 12, 27.

3T. Polyciiti.... Aegiali. Polyclitus and Vatinius were fa­

vorite freedmen of Nero, who rose to wealth and honor during his

reign, and whose very names were ever after synonymous with ra­

pacity and oppression, as T. says, 2, 95: vetera odiorum nomina.

Polyclitus is mentioned, Ann. 14, 39 ; Vatinius, 15, 34. The name of

Aegialus does not occur elsewhere, for which reason, as well as from

the obscurity of the Medicean MS., much dispute has arisen as to the

reading. The text is that of Or. and Dod. Al. Helii, and Helii et

Haloti.

38. Paraveruut. As if they had enriched themselves by their

industry and economy, but Icelus by robbery [rapuit). Al. perierunt:

rapientes being supplied by brachylogy from rapuit. Cf. Essay, p. 15.

1. Si ipse imperasset. If he had been emperor himself, instead

of being prime-minister. In that case, Otho means to imply, Vinius

would have felt some interest in us as his subjects. But now he has

us in his power as completely as if we had been his own property,

and yet holds us in no estimation as the property of another.

2. Una ilia domus. The single family, i. e. property of Vinius.

As to the wealth of Vinius, vid. again chap. 48.

3. Exprobratur, sc. as if an unreasonable demand. Dod.

Ch. XXXVIII.—6. Ah exsilio. Cf. 21 and 43.

T. Notabili tempestate. Cf. 18.

8. Adversantes. Al. aversantes. Cf. note, 1: adverseris.—Idem,

sc. the same with the gods, i. e. they too are opposed to it. Accord­

ingly he adds: vestra virtus, etc., your valor alone is further requu

red, lit. waited for.
