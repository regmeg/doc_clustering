K£away his own (private) property and lavished that which was not his

(sc. the public), they called it goodness (kindness). At the same

time, i. e. still further, in their eagerness for power, the friends of

Vitelline construed his very vices (viz. gluttony and debauchery) as

virtues. Such is Wr.'s reading and interpretation of this difficult pas­

sage. Rup., Dod. and Or. insert ut between et and Vitellius, without

MS. authority.

36. Donaret. Subj. to express the views of others, not of the

author = because, as they said, he gave, etc. Cf. Gr. 266,3; Z. 571.

37. Multi is made the subj. of interpretabantur in the previous

sentence in the common editions. But such a view of things could

hardly be predicated of the modesti quietique and the mali et strenui

in common. Besides that reading destroys the force of sed in the next

clause. T. has given the character of Vitellius above. He now passes

to give a sketch of the army and its officers. He says, there were in

hoth armies (sc. of Upper and of Lower Germany) many peaceable

(quieti) and unambitious (modesti) characters; there were also many

turbulent (mali, ill-disposed, cf. apud malos seditio, 26) and restless

(strenui) spirits: but Caecina and Valens excelled in, etc.

gf£ 3. Tanquam. Because in his opinion. Hence followed by the

aubj. Cf. note, G. 20: tanquam.—Gunctationem. Hesitation. Cf.

wote, 33. Indecision in such a case (sc. when the empire was offered

him, cf. 8 and 9) would be construed as a crime against Galba, who

would expect of Verginius a prompt and decided negative.

1. Iugrate tulisset. Had received without due gratitude. Dod.

makes tulisset = retulisset: had made an ungrateful return for.

5» Ipsum. Vitellius himself.

6. Flacco Hordeonio. Cf. 9.

8. Panderet. A nautical metaphor, non a sinu togae, sed potius

a nautis, qui pandunt sinum velorum. So Rup. But Dod. and Or.

refer it to the toga: only let him open his bosom.

lO. Equestri familia, etc. Abl. of quality. Cf. note, 44.

12. Collegium Caesaris. L. Vitellius, the father of the emperor,

had been colleague with Claudius Caesar twice in the consulship and

once in the censorship. Cf. Suet. Vitel. chap. 2.

Ch. LIII.—16. Decora juventa, corpore Ingens, etc. Notice

the enallage. These phrases all express the quality of Caecina, and

at the same time they indirectly denote the means of illexerat. Decora

in the sense of pulchra is poetical. Dod. follows the Medicean MS. in

retaining the antique form decori (abl.). Cf. Essay, p. 21.

19. Baetica, sc. Hispania. Galba's command was in Hispania

Tarraconensis.

SO. Compertum agrees with Caecinam.

81. Flagitari = in jus vocari, accusari. Postulare is often used

in the same sense.
