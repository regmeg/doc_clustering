BOOk i. 249

24. Principes. Gafoa, Otho, Vitellius and Domitian-, all of whom

lame to a violent death.—Trirta, poetice for tria. Cf. Gr. 120, 4.

The three civil wars here referred to are those between Otho and

Vitellius, between Vitellius and Vespasian, and of L. Antonius against

Domitian, on which last vid. Sueton. Dom. 6, Dio Cass. 67, 11. Cf.

Or. and Dod. in loc. Ruperti would reckon among them that of Otho

and Galba, which however hardly amounted to a war. Cf. note,

chap. 50: saevae pads.

25. Permixta, sc. externa cum civilibus, both being carried on

at the same time, as, for instance, the war with the Jews by Titus,

and with the Gauls and Germans under Civilis by Cerialis, in con­

nection with the civil war between Vitellius and Vespasian.

2T. Missa. Dismissed, neglected = omissa, the simple for the

compound. Cf. Essay, p. 10.

28. Mutuis, i. e. alternis, acceptis et illatis. Rup.—Dacus. Cf. note,

G. 1; also ibid. Sarmatae. Of the wars with the Sarmatians, o£ 1, 79;

3, 5. 24; 4, 54; with the Dacians, cf. His. 3, 46; 4, 54; A. 41. Of

the wars with the Suevi we have no other account. The Suevi here

meant, says Lipsius, are not the tribe more commonly so called, that

dwelt in Germany (Germ. 38, seqq.), but another tribe located beyond

the Danube by the Sarmatae, and hence often associated with them,

e. g. Ann. 12, 29 ; Sueton. Dom. 6 ; Dion Cass. 67, 5. Cf. Or. in loc.

29. Faisi.... ludibrio. The farce, or game, of the pretended

Nero. T. informs us (His. 2, 8), that inasmuch as there were various

reports touching the end of Nero, many pretended and believed that

he was still alive. Hence he was personated by several impostors, as

late even as the reigns of Titus and Domitian. Cf. Suet. Nero, 57.

30. Jam vero. Cf. note, G. 14.—Cladibus. Calamities, not

slaughters, as just above.

31. Haustae .... miles. Herculaneum and Pompeii; destroyed

by an eruption from Mount Vesuvius in the second year of the reign

of Titus, a. u. c. 832. Cf. Pliny's account of the catastrophe and the

death of his uncle (Pliny the Elder), in a letter to Tacitus. Epis. 6,

16, 20 ; and Plut. de Ser. Num. Vind., 42.

32. Ora. Abl. of place without a prep. Wr. connects it with

the following clause, and refers the clause to the desolation of the

Campaniau country by the fires of Vesuvius.—Incendiis. Besides

that in which the capitol was burnt (3, 71-2), there was another and

more dreadful conflagration bf the city (Rome) in the reign of Titus,

A. u. 833. Cf. Dio. 66, 24. Or.

1. Pollutae caerimonlae, sc. incestis Vestalium. Suet. Dom.32

8,22; Plin. Epp. 4, 11, 6.—Magna adulteria, i. e. principum viro-

rum. So magnae domus, amicitiae, inimicitiae, etc. = houses, &c.,

of the great.

2. Plenum y. .. mare. The sea full of exiles (exsiliis for extu-
