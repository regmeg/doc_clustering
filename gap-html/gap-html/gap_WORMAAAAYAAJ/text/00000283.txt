32. Valescere is present to denote a general principle. The word^g

is poetical. Cf. Boetticher.

33. Ultro. Wr. renders : moreover; Or.: at pleasure.

34. Regressus is genitive after facultatem repeated from the fore­

going clause.— Si poeniteat. Suhj. of the dependent clause in oratio

obliqua. Gr. 266, 2; Z. 603. Observe the use of the present here,

where we must use the imperf., and where the general rule wojld re­

quire the imperf. (as depending on censebat). The Latin admits of

either in the same sentence and in the same sense. Cf. Arnold's Pr.

Intr. 455. 468. We must render it by the imperf.: if he regretted, or

should regret. We can use the present only with the second person:

if you regret. So si ratio sit: if there was or should be occasion.

Ch. XXXIII.—35. Ceteris. The rest, i. e. all but T. Viuius.

3T. Iguaros. Unacquainted with him. Cf. 26: ignorantibus.

38. Cunctatione = hesitation, lit waiting to collect every thing

(from cunctus) ; or perhaps trying to do something (conor).—Segnitia

= sloth.—Terentium agrees with nostrum, sc. Galbianorum, under­

stood.—Imitari principem, i. e. to act his part as princeps.

1. Discat. Subj. because a dependent clause in the oratio obliqua. 46

2. Capitollum adeat, sc. de more, ut auspicaturus imperium et

grates diis acturus sacrificet. Ernesti. Cf. 47: in capitolium vectus.

For the pres. subj. cf. note, 32: si poeniteat. So also elavguescat

and necesse sit just below.

3. Dum .... cludit. The ind., contrary to the rule, to represent

the shutting up more as a matter of fact and less as a contingency

Cf. Gr. 266, R. 5 ; Z. 575.—Egregius ... fortibus. Spoken ironically

4r. Terius. Properly a noun in the acc. of limit or measure, mean­

ing as to extent. Hence it follows (not is followed by) the gen. and

the abl. Cf. Freund sub voce. Here it seems to be used pretty much

as in the phrases verba tenus, nomine tenus, hactenus, etc., iu the

aense or merely: by the gate and threshold merely, not by arms, as

truly brave men would do. Cf. Dod. in loc. Observe the repetition

of kindred words (janua and limine) for emphasis. Cf. note, 27:

gaudiis, and places there cited.—Nimirum also denotos irony.— Tole-

raturus. Al. toleraturos.

5. Praeciarum, etc. Said in derision of Vinius' proposal: oppo-

nenda servitia, 33.

6. Quae .... valet. The indie, here, contrary to the rule (Gr.
