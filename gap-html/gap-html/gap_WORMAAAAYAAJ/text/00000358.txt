354 NOTES.

P«««

jjg Ch. XCIX.—38. Expedire. MSS. expediri. But the active is

used elsewhere by T., when officers get ready for a campaign, cf. 1,10,

note, 1, 88 ; the passive only when troops are dispatched, Ann. 15,10.

120 Meditate Al. meditanti, and meditantis. But meditato ia

nearest to the MSS. which read meditatio; and it accords with the

usage of T. who often puts the past part, of dep. verbs in-an aorist

sense for the present. Cf. 3, 25: placatos manes. So Wr and Dod.

Ch. C—18. Vexilla. Cf. note, 1, 31. The MSS. differ much,

and are manifestly corrupt in the specification of the legions to which

these vexillaries belonged. The reading given in the text is that of

Bekker, Ritter, Ruperti and Duebner, and accords with the enumera­

tion in 3, 22, where there are no various readings.

* 24. Immutatum. This word is sometimes used as an adj., when  
it means unchanged; here it is a part, and means changed. Cf.

Z. 328.

26. Cremonam. Cf. note, 2, 17. The legions ordered to Cre­

mona were Rapax and Italica, as appears infra, 3,14. The rest went

to Hostilia. Cf. 3, 21.

2T. Hostiliam. A village on the Po; now Ostiglia, in the

neighborhood of Cremona.—Ravennam. Cf. note, 9 : Misenensi.

28. Patavii. The birthplace of Livy; now Padua.

Ch. CI.—38. Corruptas ... adulationem. Exhibited in false

colors for the sake of flattery.—Causas, sc. proditionis illius Caecinae

et Bassi.

1. Nobis = mihi.—Super = praeter.

3. Ipsum videntur, sc. Crecina and Lucilius. Ipsum is ant. to

apud: that they might not be surpassed by others in the estimation

of Vitellius, they appear to have ruined Vitellius himself. Al. antei-

* tetur and videtur, with Caecina alone for the subject . But why in  
that case should the name of Ceecina be repeated at the beginning of

the next sentence ? The text is that of Or. and the Medicean MS.

BOOK III.

|24 Ch. I.—2. Poetovionem. A tow7i in the borders of Noricum

and Paunonia, on the river Drave ; now Pettau. i

3. Obstrui .... Alpes, i. e. more fully guarded, closed up; they

were already praesidiis insessae (cf. 2, 98), but only so as to inter­

cept the passage of messengers: nuntios retinebant.

4. Consurgeret. Rise up together, i. e. accumulate near the field

of action.
