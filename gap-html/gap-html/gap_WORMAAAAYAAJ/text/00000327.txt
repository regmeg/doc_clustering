fieret . Ernesti.

26. Alpinos here includes, according to Wr. and Dod., both the

Pannonians and the Ligurians mentioned above.

31. Audebant. The ind. is used in this clause (though it follows

the subj.), because it stands in so slight a dependence being a mere

additional remark.

34. Attiiiuissct. Checked.—Ohtentui fugientibus. Obtentui, in­

stead of obtentus in apposition with obscurum. Supply quod esset :

had not the victorious army been checked by the darkness of the

encampment. Agentem is used absolutely, like tendentem, for agen­

tem excubias or stationem. Cf. 1, 31. A. 18.

38. Sidente. Al. cedente. Metus multo exquisitius rectiusque

dicitur sidere quam cedere. Wr. Sidere is found, however, in this

tropical sense only in the poets, and those not till the age of Tacitus.

invicem, note.

20. Inconditos. Undisciplined, unused to military service.

25. Et aversi = itaque aversi sunt. Observe the concise and

elliptical structure of the whole sentence.—Aperta vi strictly limits

some verb understood, and sed is omitted before aptum, as often

in T.

2T. Balineis. The writers of the silver age imitate the poets in

a more frequent use of the abl. without a prep, to designate the place

where. Z. 482.— Comites, sc. from Rome, whereas those, qui Paca-

rium frequentabant, and who made their escape, were residents of the

island.
