810 NOTES.

Fag*

Qjfor. Cf. Ann. 2, 88: regnum affectans; His. 2, 91: plebis rumorem

affectavit. The substantive is nearly confined to the post-Augustan

prose.—Quietis here is explained by quietis castris above.—Fuit,

rather than evaluit, is appropriate to the first two clauses. Render:

the time excited suspicion, the object aimed at was made a ground

of accusation, and the special pains taken to find a quiet time be­

came the occasion of a tumult.

22. Sul, sc. anna. Sui is the gen. pl. of the reflexive. Cf. a

similar sentiment in Odys. 16, 292 : airbs yap Itpfatzta, dvSpa oiSqpos,

assigned by Ulysses to Telemachus as a reason for removing the armor

of the drunken suitors out of their sight. Lipsius. Dod. thinks it an

allusion to Homer.—Miles, sc. praetorianus.

23. Famlliae, i. e. servi. Cf. note, G. 15.

25. In occasionem, denotes the end or aim (cf. A. 8: infamam,

note), as ignari and cupidum express the state of mind in which the

other classes acted. To make the construction regular, supply inten-

tus before in. Cf. Essay, p. 17. But Tacitus prefers enallage.

Ch. LXXXI.—31. Celebre. Properly crowded (from cello,

*('XAu), frequented; hence distinguished, celebrated. Either sense  
would be appropriate here. The former, however, is preferable. The

latter signification is not found in Cresar and Cicero. Cf. Freund sub

voce. Observe the use of the imperf. erat for an unfinished action.

3 2. Fortuitusne .... foret. This whole member of the sentence

depends on trepidus, which means trembling with uncertainty wheth­

er, etc. Supply esset with furor and dolus. Cf. Essay, p. 14.

35. Detegi, sc. as mere pretenders to firmness,

gg 1. Statim miserat denotes an act prior to jussit. Hence the

pluperfect.—2. Passim. From the part, of pando.

5. Incerta. Unknown, untraceable. Cf. A. 38: incerta fugae

vestigia.

Ch. LXXXII.—T. Mllltum .... irrumperent. Xiphilinus (64,

9) represents this as the natural result of Otho's largesses, flattery and

excessive familiarity with the soldiers.—Foribus attaches quidem to

it, as being the emphatic word. The word manifestly has the same

root as the Gr. 8ipa and the Eng. door. The same root is also found

in German, Sanscrit, etc. Fores is properly the folds of the door;

porta the aperture.

9. Martiale. When such adj. as these become proper names,

they always have e in the abl.: as Juvenale, Martiale, etc Z. 63, c.

10. Praefecto legionis. An officer who, in the absence of the

legatus legionis, took his place in the comlBSnd, called elsewhere le-

gioni praepositus. 2, 86; 3, 52.

15. Toro. Couch; properly a soft cushion or pillow, then the

whole sofa, couch, or bed. Rams, refers it to torqueo (622), where see

it distinguished from lectus, cubile, etc.
