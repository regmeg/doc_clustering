r«ga

T* Noil .... dignus, sed alio meliore principe. Rup. jjg

Ch. XC—lO. AUerius civitatis. Another city, i. e. a foreign

one, where his vices were unknown. AUerius = alius. Cf. A. 17.

15. Adulationes = adnlationis formulae. Wr.

16. Astrepebat is post-Augustan and particularly frequent in

T. Cf. Freund sub voce.

17. Tam frustra. To as little purpose, sc. because he enjoyed

it for so short a time. The language here is very concise and ellipti­

cal, two clauses being thrown into one, thus: they forced him to ac­

cept it; he did accept it, but to as little purpose, etc. Cf. note, 76:

ne ... Othonem fecit. Dod. connects frustra with expressere in the

sense of falso, thus: they extorted from him an acceptance with as

little sincerity as he had previously declined the honor.

Ch. XCI.—19. Interpretantem. Putting a superstitious con­

struction upon.

20. Quod .... edixisset. Cf. note, 74: transisset.

22. Cremerensi ciade. The defeat and slaughter of the 300

Fabii at the river Cremera, A. u. c. 277.

23. Allieusi. The same of the Roman army at the river Allia,

A. v. c. 364, by the Gauls under Brennus.

The day on which these disasters befell the Romans, was ever after

deemed unlucky ; and on such days no important business might be

transacted.

24. Expers. Ignorant or regardless.—Pari. Equal, sc. to

that of Vitellius.

25. Comltia consilium. Cf. note, 1, 14: comitia imperii; also

Smith's Die. Ant. sub voce. Render: But frequenting the consular

elections with his (favorite) candidates, just like a common citizen

(civiliter), i. e. soliciting votes for them, &c. This was in the senate,

who at this time had the nominal power, and went through the form

of electing consuls. The remainder of the sentence introduces another

illustration of his excessive condescension, viz. his conduct in the

theatre and the circus, among the common people. In a less concise

writer it would have been thrown into a distinct sentence or clause.

29. Vitae prioris. Cf. notes, chap. 71.

31. Priscus Helvidius. Cf. A. 2, note.—Praetor designatus,

i. e. prattor elect, but not yet inducted into office.

32. Noil .... ultra. Ellipsis of saeviit, or some other verb:

did not, however, proceed further than to call—lit. no more than
