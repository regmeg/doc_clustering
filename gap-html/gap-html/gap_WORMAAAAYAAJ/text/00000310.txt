306 NOTES.

g^the antithesis, mutua ignorantia, and the force of invicem certainly

require gnaris: strange faces, where all knew each other, would ot

course betray the Othonian spies. But not so with the Vitellians at

Rome, where almost all were mutually strangers.

gK 2. Domua utraque, sc. Vitellii sub Othone, Othonis sub Vitellio.

It so happened, that the family connexions of Vitellius were at Rome,

and at the mercy of Otho; while those of Otho were in like manner

at the disposal of Vitellius.

Ch. LXXVI.—*. Primus addidit. First gave. The

Latins use the adj. where we use the adv. of time. The news from

Illyricum was the first thing that imparted confidence to Otho.

8. Aquitania. Southwestern Gaul.

9. Dlu mansit, sc. in fide. Cited by Dodorlein as an example

of praegnantia. Cf. Essay, p. 16.

11. pfovinciam Naruanfnsem. Southeastern Gaul.

13. Armorum = cxeJ^^Kn.—Dirimitur, sc. ab Italia. The

reference is to the troops in Hf/fk, Asia, Africa, &c.

15. Praetexto. Al. praetextu. Cf. specie senatus, chap. 74.

The specious name, the pretended authority of the senate. Prae-

textum is not found before the age of Tacitus. Cf. Boetticher.

16. Auditus also is a post-Augustan substantive, and is employed

here in the unusual sense of auditio, report. The distant provinces

and armies had heard of Otho's nomination, and acquiesced in it, be­

fore they knew of Vitellius', though actually prior in order of time.

20. Neque = et non, et connecting the clause, and non qualify­

ing exspectata.

21. Proconsulis. Cf. note, 49: pro consule.

22. Nam .... faciunt. Cf. notes, 13, and G. 25.

24. Pleraque. Intollige ea, quae fieri solent sub milium novi

imperii. Wr.—Festinavit. Cf. note on festinantur. G. 20.

Ch. LXXVII.—26. Distractis, sc. in contrarias partes.

27. Quidem gives emphasis to the comparison between Vitellius

and Otho, and it shows the impropriety of attaching this clause to the

previous section, as in the old editions. The antith. particle scd is

understood before Otho. Cf. 3, note. Ernesti inserts at.

28. Ctuaedam is the obj. of obibat, pleraque of properando,

which is used instead of properans.

30. In .... Marti as. Till the 1st of March, sc. from the com­

mencement of his reign with the death of Galba, on the 15th of Jan­

uary. Cf. 27. For the construction of Martias, cf. 12, note. The

consulship was originally annual, and elective by the people; but in

the reign of Tiberius, the office becoming merely an honor conferred

by the emperors (nominally by the senate, Ann. 1, 15), was held for

only two months, there being of course 6 pairs (consules = col­

leagues, cf. note, 1) during the year, those who held it for the first two
