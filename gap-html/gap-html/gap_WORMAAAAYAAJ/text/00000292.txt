288 NOTES.

51 in T., in which a singlo stroke shows us the very age and body of the

times.

4. Jussum, sc. esse, depending on affirmans.—Poenas daturum,

lit. give satisfaction, cf. note on poena, 37; by usage, suffer pun­

ishment.

Cn. XLVI.—T . Ipsi legere. The power of choosing such officers

belonged to the senate and people ; but was usurped by the emperors,

and now conceded by Otho to the soldiers themselves.—E manipula-

ribus. A common soldier. Cf. 25.

8. Vigilibus praepositum. This would not make him a regular

officer iu the army. Cf. note on vigiliis, 20. It was, therefore, a

sudden elevation to place such a man at the head of tho praetorians.

9. Adjungitur .... Proculus, i. e. the praetorians choose Procu-

Ius as colleague with Firmus in the praefectship. We should expect

Proculum in the ace, and connected with Firmum as the object of

legere. Anacoluthon. Cf. Gr. 323, 3, (5).

11. Urbi .... praefecere. Cf. praefecto urbis, 14, note.

13. Flagitatum. Cf. note on fiagitare, 12. It is followed by

ut, with the subj., like other verbs of demanding.

14. Vacationes = pretia vacationum (Ann. 1, 17), i. e. fees for

exemption from military duty, or rather camp duty, for those who

had the vacatio were expected to fight, if present in time of battle,

but were not required to share in the watch, the labor of fortifying,

etc. Such exemption had been conferred as an honor in better

times; it was now bought with money. The use of vacatio, in this

sense, is peculiar to Tacitus. Cf. Boetticher.

15. Tributum. Originally the tax of a tribe (from tribus, cf.

Niebuhr, Rom. His.; Keightley and Schmitz. do.); subsequently any

tax or tribute.

16. ManlpuII. This word denotes properly a handful or bunch

of hay, then by metonymy a detachment of soldiers serving under the

same as an ensign. Cf. note, chap. 25. Under the emperors there

were three maniples in each cohort and ten cohorts in each legion, so

that the maniple was one-thirtieth of a legion.

IT. Dum exsolveret. Provided only, that they would

pay, etc. Dum, in this sense, takes the subj. Cf. Gr. 2G3,2; and

Freund sub voce.

18. Pensi is gen. after habebat. Gr. 214, (2); Z. 444, note: no

one cared for the measure of the burden or the kind of gain, i. o. the

source from which he derived his means to pay the fee. Orelli re­

marks, that pensi habere aliquid is a favorite formula with Sallust,

whom Monboddo charges Tacitus with imitating, and whom he cer­

tainly resembles in style.

80. Tum. Furthermore = our and then.—Locupletissimus.

Properly, rich in real estate (locus ... plenus). Cf. Freund sub voce.
