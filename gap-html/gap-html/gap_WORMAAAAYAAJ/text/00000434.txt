430 NOTES.

220 —ProtUSia. Ad verbum, cf. note, 1, 3. Ad rem,

compare tho fuller account of these prodigies in Josephus (B. J. 6, 5,

3; 7,31), and with both histories compare the predictions of Christ

(Mat. 27, 45. 51 ; Luke, 23, 44. 45). The Roman and the Jewish

historians both strikingly confirm the prophetic character and divine

mission of the great Teacher, in whom neither of them believed.

88. Superstitioni. See the etymology of the word in note, 3,

58. It is commonly used by T. in a bad sense, as here.

221 Exapertae... fores. These doors or gates were of brass, and

could scarcely be opened by twenty men. Cf. Joseph. B. J. 6, 5, 3.

Exapertae is found in no other classic writer. It appears in Jerome's

confessions.

3. Delubri. Probably from de and luo = the place of expiation-

Freund.—Excedere deos. That the gods (the guardian divinities of

the temple) were departing. Compare with this the Roman custom

of evoking the gods from the cities which they besieged. Plin-

28, 4.

4. In metum trahebant.' Construed as a ground of fear- i. e.

as ominous of evil. So Ann. 14, 32: ad metum trahebant. Trahere is

used in the same sense in 3, 3.

5. Antiquis .... Uteris, i. e. the books of the prophets, which

are full of prophecies of the Messiah, and some of which, e. g. Daniel,

fix with great defiuiteness the time of his coming (eo ipso tempore).

The Jews understood these to promise a temporal deliverer and con­

queror. Hence the universal expectation, that at this very time the

East should become powerful, and persons proceeding from Judaa

should become masters of the world. Languago happily descriptive

of the spiritual conquests of Christ and his apostles! Josephus and

Suetonius use very similar language. B. J. G, 5, 1; Suet. Vesp. 4.

T. Q,uae ambages .... praedixerat. Which oracle was to be

accomplished in Vespasian and Titus, who had command in the

East, and thence marched to the sovereignty of Rome. Such an in­

terpretation would bo easily adopted by a Roman historian, especially

one who had received favors from the Flavian dynasty (cf. 1, 1). It

is even countenanced by Josephus, in compliment doubtless to the

same princes. B. J. 6, 5, 1. Al. praedixerant. Ambages is used by

other writers only in the pl. and the abl. sing. Cf. Ann. 6, 46.

lO. Ne adversis .... mutabantur. Nor have they been by all

the calamities that have befallon them through eighteen centuries of

persecution

12. Sexcenta millla. Josephus (B.J. 6, 9, 3.4) and Zonaras

(G, 26) estimate the number who perished in and after the siege at

eleven hundred thousand. Others make it still larger. Ernesti re­

marks, that the number of the slain in battles and sieges is the most

frequent subject of discrepancy in all history.
