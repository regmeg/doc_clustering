BOOk v. 425

proverb among the Arabs to this day. Modern travellers find in that 2] g

vicinity a plant or tree (the Solanum) whose fruit answers in many

respects to the description of T. and other ancient writers, and bears

the popular name of the grapes of Sodom. Cf. Robinson, ii. p. 23G.

472.—Ego. Inserted for emphasis, like our for my part.

15. Sicut.... concesserim, ita. While (though) J might ad­

mit, etc. yet, etc. For concesserim, cf. note, G. 2: crediderim.

16. Halitu lacus is emphatic, as its position shows, and it limits

not only infid but corrumpi.—Infici. Poisoned, as it were, i. e. made

unfruitful. It is by the exhalations of the lake that the sov'Z is made

unfruitful, and the surrounding (lit. poured over or lying above) at­

mosphere rendered unwholesome, and for that reason the crops and

fruits decay.

18. Juxta = pariter.—Judaico mari. The Mediterranean. It

was on this coast that the manufacture of glass was accidentally dis­

covered by some mariners, who having a cargo of nitre used lumps

of it for andirons, which being melted in connection with the sand

formed glass. See the account of the discovery and a description of

the country at the mouth of the Belus, corresponding with this of T.,

in Plin. N. H. 36, 65-67.

20. Excoquuntur is poetical.—Modicum. According to Pliny,

half a mile; according to Josephus (B. J. 1, 2, 10), only a hundred

cubits.—Et = et tamen.—Egerentibus, sc. arenam.—Inexhaustum.

Inexhaustible. Cf. G.20: inexhausta puberlas ; Virg. Aeii. 10, 174:

incxhausta metalla. So invictus = invincible. Z. 328. A. 33, note.

Ch. VIII.—22. Magna .... dispergitur. A large part of Ju-

drea is sprinkled over with villages. A more simple and usual mode

of expression would have been : villages are scattered over a large part

of Judosa,

23. Genti caput. Al. gentis. To the nation, i. e. in their

estimation.—Immensae .... templum. Touching this temple, which

was built by Herod the Great, and which exceeded even Solomon's in

magnificence, cf. Joseph. Ant. J. 15, 11, 1-7; B. J. 5, 5, 2-6; Kit.

Bib. Cyclop., Temple; John, 2, 20: Forty and six years was this

temple in building, i. e. in being completed. The principal part of the

work was done in eight years.

24. Primis clausum, i. e. there were three distinct walls:

the first enclosing the whole city, the second the palace, and the third

or inmost the temple. Cf. 11: alia intus moenia regiae drcumjecta;

and 12: templum .... propriique muri. Observe the author's fond­

ness for variety of expression, dein for secundis, adv. for adj.

26. Arcebantur, sc. all, Jews as well as Gentiles. At the time

this history was written, the temple had been destroyed. Hence the

propriety of the past tense, for which Ernesti would substitute arcen-

tur. Tho imp. here denotes customary past action. Compare with
