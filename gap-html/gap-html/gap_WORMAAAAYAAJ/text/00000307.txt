citizens for colonization." Rams. 206. Compare both with urbs, caput

and civitas, 68, note. The coloniae were also afterwards called mu-

nicipia, from which they differed only in origin. Cf. Smith's Diet.,

under Colonia.—Mediolanum. Now Milan.

34. Vexillis. Cf. 31, note.—Ala Petrina. Supposed to have

derived its name from two illustrious Roman knights, who bore the

cognomen of Petra and were put to death by Claudius. Cf. Ann. 11,

4. It had been stationed in Cumberland, as appears by a lapidary in­

scription set forth in Camden's Britannia.—Gunctatus. Supply est.

Hesitated.—Num. flecteret. Subj. Cf. Gr. 265 ; Z. 552.

35. Ibi. This conjectural reading of Lipsius and Brotier is so well

supported by the analogy of 2,16: trierarchum liburnicarum ibi navium,

that I have ventured to receive it into the text. Rup. and Or. have

urbi, Wr. and Dod. urbis, which are the readings of the KISS. But

they include the v. ord in brackets and pronounce it a manifest corrup­

tion. A procuratf f a dty is an office unknown in Roman history.

36. Coiiciti! .. pontiims. Abl. abs. denoting the cause of

putabatur. Re; r: because he had called together auxiliaries, etc.

Cf. note, 61.- -Subsignanum militem = militem sub signis, or vexil-

lis, alias vexillarios, for which see note, 31. They are here distin­

guished from the legions, which served sub aquila, and seem to be

treated with special indulgence in being allowed to take the easier

route. The meaning of the word, which is post-Augustan, has been

much disputed, but it probably designates the veterans described under

No. 3, in the note on vexilla at chap. 31. It occurs in only ono other

passage in Tacitus, 4, 33.

3. Hibernis = hiemantibus, nive conspersis. Rup.

Ch. LXXI.—T. Composita implies something made up, assumed.

Cf. 54, and places there cited.

8. Vitia reditura. Cf. above, 21. 22. and 30.

9. Maiium .... subtractum. Cf. 45.

II. Titulus = praetextus. Bach. But Rup. and Or. make it

. 13. Ultro Imputavit. He even (cf. note, G. 20: ultra) reckoned

,t as a ground of obligation, or confidence on the part of Otho—in a

word, he claimed credit for it as an example of good influence on

others, and illustrating the steadfastness of his own loyalty. " When

an author so expresses himself, we can but guess at his meaning." So

Monboddo. But the obscurity results entirely from his lordship's ig­

norance of the usus loqueudi of T., as his criticism on the passage

plainly shows.—Nec Otho, etc. Nor did Otho proceed as if he were

pardoning an enemy, but lest the opposite party should excite in
