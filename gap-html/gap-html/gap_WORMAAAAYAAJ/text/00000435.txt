BOOK V. 431

13. Plures quam pro numero, i. e. more than the fourth or fifth 22]

part, that are usually reckoned able to bear arms.

15. Hanc adversus urbem. Hanc is put first, as the emphatic

word: such was the city against which, etc. T. allows himself in

such liberties oftener than most Latin authors.

16. Subita belli, lit. sudden modes of warfare. Cf. A. 37. ' Here

it manifestly refers to carrying the city by storm, in contradistinction

to the gradual approaches of a regular siege. The use of abnuere, in

the sense of forbidding a thing, belongs to the later Latin, "and is a

favorite usage of T. Cf. Boet. Lex. Tac.

The foregoing thirteen sections are all that remain of our author's

history of the Jewish war. The major part of his entire Histories is

lost (cf. Preliminary Remarks, p. 231), and, with the rest, his narra­

tive of the destruction of Jerusalem, a tragic scene which T. must

have described with great power—fit theme for such a master, as he

was a master fully adequate to such a theme.

Ch. XIV.—21. Mai am .... pugnam. The unsuccessful battle,

or defeat, described 4, 77. 78

23. Tutus loco. The security of the situation involves the first

reason. Observe the varied grammatical construction, by which T.

chooses to express thetame logical relation.—Et ut .... animi. This

clause assigns a second reason why Civilis encamped at Vetera (which

he had previously taken and plundered, 4, 60).

24. Eodem. Old dat. used adverbially = to the same place.

26. Post victoriam, sc. that gained by Cerialis and the 21st le­

gion over Civilis. Cf. 4, 78.

28. Arcebat. Hindered, sc. an engagement. Observe the au­

thor's conciseness.

29. Addiderat, i. e. had interposed us an additional obstacle to

an engagement, over and 'above the natural wetness of the plains

(camporum suopte ingenio humentium).—Molem — a dam of wood

or stone ; agger, a dike of earth. Or.

30. Ea .... forma. Such was the nature of the country (lo­

cality).—33. Proceritas corporum. Cf. G. 4: magna corpora.

Ch. XV.—35. Ferocissimo cuique. Dat. of the agent = a fe-

rocissimo quoque. Cf. notes, 1,86: auctoribus, and 3,12: Vespasiano.

3T. Anna, equi. Notice the asyndeton. The arms were first

dropped by the horsemen in their trepidation, and then they sunk to

the bottom (haurirentur).

1. Pedestri acie. A land fight in opposition to a naval battle 222

(navali pugna). So pedestris is often used by the best Latin authors,

like Tt^oi, ,rt$o/<ax«,, etc., in Greek.

6. Egredi paludem. Cf. note, 4, 44: egressos exsilium.

Ch. XVI.—IT. Propiora fluminis. The parts nearer the river.

Propior and proximus may be followed by the gen. in this sense. Cf
