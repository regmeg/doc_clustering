reelings are described in chap. 5.

10. Comitia Imperii. Language borrowed from the usages of

the republic (cf. remarks on imperatores, 7), and properly denoting an

assembly of the people for the choice of a magistrate, but here a coun­

cil of a few friends and leading men convened for the nomination of a

successor to Galba in the empire.

11. Adhibito. Being called in, lit. being had in. For the

number of adhibito, cf. Gr. 205, Exc. to R. 2.

12. Praefecto urbis. A different office from the praefectus

praetorii (13J, being a kind of mayorship, to which the emperor ap­

pointed from among those who had been consuls.

13. Pisonem Licinianum. Cf. Suet. Galb. 17: nobilem egregi-

umque juvenem, etc. All accounts give Piso a character worthy of a

better fortune and a better age. Cf. also Plut. Galb. 23.—Arcessi. A

frequentative of accedo. Cf. Freund, sub voce. The MSS. here havo

accersiri. Or. and Dod. read accersi.

14. Propria electione. Suet, (in loc. cit.) makes Piso an old

acquaintance and friend of Galba: sibi olim probatissimum, testamen-

toque semper in bona et nomen adscitum.

18. Vultu habituque. Abl. of quality. Gr. 211, R. 6, (1): with

face and mien of the old style. Cf. habitus, G. 4. 17. Here it in­

face (vultu). Or. and Dod. have voltu, after the older form.

20. Tristior, sc. justo, Gr. 256, R. 9. Too gloomy, morose.

21. Quo = by as much as; antithetic to eo magis understood

before adoptandi, with the usual conciseness of Tacitus.

Ch. XV.—23. Privatus. Antithetic to ad imperium vocatum.

Si also is antithetic to nunc.—Lege curiata, i. e. a law passed by the

Roman people in their curiae ; for such a law was originally necessary

to ratify an adoption or transfer from one family or gens to another.

But long before the age of Galba, the comitia curiata (assembly of

the curiae) had become obsolete (cf. remarks under comitia imperii,

14), and all that was now requisite was the presence and sanction of

the Pontifex, which office was held by the emperor, so that the lex

curiata and the pontificate were concentrated in Galba.

24. Et mini. Et = both, correl. to et tibi. The honor would

have been mutual.—Erat. Ind. for subj. Not uncommon in Lat
