26. Vultum habitumque. Cf. note, 1, 17. qa

2T. In dcterius. Cf. in majus, 1, 18.

3 2. Tutior agrees with quisque implied in nemo, which = jk«'«-

ply ordo. Smith's Die. under Colonia.

34. Patres Conscriptos. See the origin of this double title ex­

plained, Liv. 2, 1.—Intempestivo honore. Ill-timed enough always

under the emperors, but especially ill-timed now, when the senators

were assembled only in part, out of the city and without their

princeps.

Ch. LIII.—36. Ambigua. Vacillating between Otho and Vi-

tellius.

37. Invisum .. . . nomen. Marcellus had been a notorious in­

former under Nero (cf. 4, 7. 43); and the inveterate enemy of the

virtuous Paetus Thrasea. Ann. 16, 22. 28.

(cf. 66), that their main body was not present. Superventus is a

post-Augustan word.—15. Causa. The design, motive.

16. Diplomata. Well explained in Leverett; more fully in

Smith's Die. sub voce. Cf. Plin. Ep. 10, 14. 54. The diploma con­

sisted of two leaves, or tablets folded together; hence the name (from

Gr. I,tXSu). These writs, being given by the emperor, and sealed

with his seal, were of course disregarded (negligebantur) after his

death, as null and void; but would recover their force (revalescerent),

if Otho were again believed to be alive.

18. Paucos post dies. Cf. note on magna ex parte, 37.—Poe-

nas luit. Literally, he paid the penalty. Cf. note, 1, 37: poena.
