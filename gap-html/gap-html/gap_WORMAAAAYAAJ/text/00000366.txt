002 NOTES.

132 what w remote- **r- ^* Haec m far more frequently used

to denote the following than illa. Z. 700.

30. Quod si. If then, if now. Cf. note, 1, 1.—Jam = then,

in that case.

31. Clementiam et gloriam = clementiae gloriam by hendia-

dys. So Roth. But the pi., inania, shows that the ideas are distinct.

Better thus with D6d.: an opportunity to show mercy, and the honor

of showing it, both alike empty of solid advantage.

J33 Ch. XX.—3. Duces .... prodesse, e. g. Q. Fabius Cunctator, M

Minucius Rufus, etc. Rup.

4. Pro . .. portione. Cf. note, A. 45.

5. Armis ac manu .... ratione et consilio. Cf. notes, 1, 84;

2, 46. 76, etc., on pairs of kindred words.

6. N eque .... occurrant. For there can be no question as to

the obstacles that await our progress. So Pliny uses occurrit of Mt.

Taurus, as meeting and obstructing the course of the Euphrates.

8. Nisi explorato. Without reconnoitering. Explorato is an

impers. part. So Livy: ante explorato, an exploration having been

previously made. Cf. Gr. 257, R. 9 ; Z. 647.

10. Q,uis ... foret. All this depends on adempto ... prospectu.

11. Tormeutis et telis. By engines and missiles, i. e. from a

distance.—Operibus et vineis. With breastworks (mounds, turrets,

etc.) and mantelets (so called from resemblance to a vine arbor), i. e.

by regular approaches and a nearer assault.

13. Secures dolabrasque. Hatchets and pickaxes. The do-

labra was half axe or adze (Man. P. 3, 269, 2), for cutting, and half

pick for digging. So it is pictured on the column of Trajan. Smith's

Diet, (sub voce) makes it a kind of chisel, which was inserted between

the stones to loosen the clay and thus destroy the wall.

16. Aggerem, pluteis, cratibus. For these and the other terms

relating to a siege in this section, cf. Man. P. 3, 299; and Smith's

Diet, sub voce.

18. Q,uin .... ferimus. Why not rather, etc. Cf. note, 3, 2-

quin.

Ch. XXI —23. Prope seditiouem. Prope used as a prep, with

acc. Cf. Z. 411, also 267 and 323.

26. Q,ui .... egerat. Ad rem, cf. 9 and 14: ut... .jungeren-

tur, note. Ad verbum, cf. note, A. 18: in finibus agentem.

2T. Millla. Our word mile.—Comperta .... clade gives tho

reason for accingi, not, as Murphy strangely makes it, for emensum.

28. Accingi .... aflbre. Were arming themselves, and would

soon be on the spot.

29. Tertiam decimam. Al. tertiam. So below for tertiam, some

read tertiam decimam. The text accords with the order of Antony's

address to the legions (24, infra), supposing Antony to have begun at
