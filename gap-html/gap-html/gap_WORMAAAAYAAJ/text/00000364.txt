360 NOTES.

Pact

ton 9. Imagines dereptae. Cf. note, 1, 41; also Xiph. 65,10.

11. Praescriptum .... projcctas. Observe the asyndeton and

its effect. Cf. note, 1, 36: praeire sacramentum, etc.

18. Ut . . . . darentur. Some connect this clause back to ut. ..

traderent, as depending on hue cecidisse, and enclose quas enim ....

ttraverintque in a parenthesis. Wr., Bek., Dod. and Or. connect it

closely with the preceding clause, on which it depends thus: whom

however they had routed and overwhelmed in those very fields, only

that (i. e. with no better reward than that) thousands of armed men

should be given, etc.; said in bitter irony. This is certainly the most

natural construction, and I see no reason for seeking any other. Kup.

makes here a succession of broken and disconnected exclamations,

which is preferable to the parenthesis of the common editions.—Exsuli

Antonio. Cf. 2, 86, note.—19. Nimirum denotes irony.

20. Accessionem. Quite an accession! Cf. Liv. 7, 30 ; 30,

12: accessio fortunae.

21. Multibus .... auferre. Al. principi auferri militem But

the reading of the text is found in all the MSS. and earliest editions,

and makes even a better sense, or at least a moro Tacitus-like anti­

thesis, than the emendation.

33. Quid .... adversa. What shall we say to those who here­

after question us touching our successes or reverses, sc. in this war,

in which we shall have met with neither—with nothing worthy of

mention. Prospera out adversa breviter dictum pro rationem pros-

perorum aut adversorum. Dod. Cf. Essay, p. 16.

Cb. XIV.—26. Initio .... orto. Cf. note, 2, 79: initium coep-

tum.—Quinta legione. This legion had been particularly forward in

rebelling against Galba, 1, 55. Xiph. (65,10) gives the same account

of this scene of commotion, and adds, that it was increased by an ac­

companying eclipse of the moon.

30. Trucidant, sc. out of resentment for the revolt of the fleet,

in which however they had no concern.

32. Ut... . jungereutur. Before the junction was effected,

Antony had defeated first the cavalry (16. 17, infra), then the two le­

gions stationed at Cremona (18) ; and these troops came up only to

share in the disaster.—33. Q,uas .... praemiserat. Cf. 2, 100.

131 Ch. XV.—3. Britannia acciverat. Cf. 2, 97.

4. Immeusam .... luem - - immensam multitudinem, quae mul-

tam luem (pernieiem) excitare poterat. Wr.

6. Secundis .... castris. Two days' march, castris bis positis.

'Cf. craBj,ovs iio, rfi,s, etc. Xen. Auab. passim.

11. Octavum, sc. lapidem, or milliarium.—A Bedriaco. From,

i. e. beyond Bedriacum; of course within twelve miles of Cremona.

Cf. note, 2, 23.—Quo .... popularentur, sc. without danger from the

enemy.
