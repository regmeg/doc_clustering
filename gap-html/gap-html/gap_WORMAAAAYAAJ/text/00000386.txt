382 NOTES.

|gy 3. Porticus. Cf. notes, 1, 40 : Basilicis, and imminentCum, ibid

lO. Diversos .... aditus. This implies that there were a;

least three approaches from the forum to the Mons Capitolinus. Cf.

Die. Antiq., Capitolium.

11. L,ucum asyli. The Asylum opened by Romulus for the in­

discriminate reception of foreigners, as described by Livy (1, 8) and

Dion. Hal. {2, 15), was situated between two groves. Only one re­

mained in the age of T., here called lucum asyli, which was situated

between the two summits of the Capitoline Hill. Cf. note, 69 : arcem

Capitolii.—Tarpeia rupes. The whole Capitoline Hill was originally

called Mons Tarpeius, from the virgin Tarpeia, who was killed and

buried there by the Sabines. Liv. 1,11. But the name Tarpeia was

afterwards confined to the rock which was the immediate scene of

her destruction, and whence criminals were thrown headlong into the

Tiber. Cf. Die. Antiq. as above.

16. Q,uac crebrior fama. Al. fama est. Pliny (N. H. 34, 7)

and Josephus (B. J. 4, 11)- charge the conflagration to the Vitellians.

But they lived in the reign of Vespasian, Tacitus under Trajan, quum

veritati, non adulationi locus esset. Brotier.

1T. Nitentes .... depulerint. Al. quo ... depellerent. But

the reading of the text, though less obvious, gives the same sense, and

rests on better authority.

18. Porticus .... aedibus, i. e. to the temple of Jupiter Capi­

tolinus, which had a triple row of l )Iumns in front, and a double row

on each side (Dionys. 4, 61), and which T. calls aedibus, perhaps be­

cause it contained within one enclosure and beneath one roof, three

aed.es, sacred severally to Jupiter, Juno and Minerva. Brotier. Cf.

Die. Antiq. as above.—Sustinentes .... aquilae. The ornaments

and supports of the pediment (vulgarly called the gable-end). These

were usually in public edifices wrought into the form of eagles with

outstretched wings. Cf. Rup. ad loc.

20. Indireptum. Josephus (B. J. 4, 11, 4) says that the Vitel­

lians plundered the temple.

Ch. LXXII.—85. Pignus imperil = ut pignus imperii esset.

Rup. (X Gr. 204, R. 1.

26. Porsena. Al. Porsenna. The penult, is short in Mart. 1,22;

Hor. Epod. 16, 4 ; Sil. Ital. 8, 391, et al.; but long in Virg. Aen. 8,

646. The best authorities are at variance touching the orthography

and the prosody of the word. Cf. Macaulay's Lays of Ancient Rome

—Dedita urbe. T. is charged by many with error here, or at least

with speaking rhetorically, rather than what was historically true. But

Niebuhr and Arnold argue with great force from the circumstances

and results of the war with Porsena, that the common history is falsi,

fied by Roman pride, and that T. has preserved the only true account,

and Rome was really surrendered to the Etruscans.
