2T. Treveri. A German people between the Meuse and the

Rhine, now Treves.—Lingones. A people of Gallia Lugdunensis on

the Seine, now Langres. The reader will be struck with the perpe­

tuity of the names of places. These always outlast spoken languages,

and often survive a series of political revolutions. Compare the Celtic

names of places in Great Britain, and the Indian names of mountains,

rivers and states in America.—Quas alias civitates. By attraction

for aliae civitates, quas. Civitates = states, not cities in our sense

of the word. Ad rem. cf. 8.

tur, i. e. by throwing their cohorts and squadrons around them, sc.

the legions. Ala = 1. The wing of a bird; 2. The wing of an

usually a larger body than turma. Cf. note, chap. 51.
