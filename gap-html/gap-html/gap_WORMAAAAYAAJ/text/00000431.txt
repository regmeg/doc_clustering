simulacra . . . templis sinunt; and note, 4: effigiem animalis.—Se-

dem, sc. dei. The seat or throne, which in Greek and Roman temples

was occupied by the image of the god.—Arcana — penetralia. It

suggests, however, a little more of the idea of secrecy and mystery.

5. Provinciae, sc. Orientis, Judaea and the neighboring provinces.

These fell to Antony in the division of the Roman empire between the

Triumviri—Octavius, Antony and Lepidus, b. c. 36.

6. Rex Parthorum. Cf. note, 2, 25: rex Epiphanes.—Inter-

fectus .... Ventidio. Cf. notes, G. 37: amisso .... Pacoro, and

Ventidium ; also, Ant. J. 14, 13. 14. 15.

7. RedactI is here used in its original sense : driven back.

8. C. Sosius. Appointed to the command in Syria by Antony,

B. c. 34.—Herodi. Herod the Great was raised to the throne by An­

tony and Octavius (then acting, in concert), with the approbation of

the senate, b. c. 40.

9. Victor Augustus, i. e. having gained the victory over Antony

in the battle of Actium.—Auxit. Enlarged its boundaries. Herod is

said to have gained the favor of Augustus by magnanimously avowing

and dwelling on the warmth of his attachment to Antony, and the

great services he had rendered him. He had not, however, taken an

immediate part in the civil war, being happily employed during that

time by Antony in a war with the king of Arabia. Cf. Diet. Biog.

and Mythol., Herodes.—Nihil.... Caesare. Without waiting for

the sanction of Augustus.

10. Simo quidam. A servant of Herod, not the Simon Bargio-

ras mentioned in 12, infra, though Rup. confounds the two, and thus

involves T. in a contradiction with other authorities touching the ex­

among the Jews.

army in Germany. Cf. note, G. 37.—Obtinente Syriam. Governor
