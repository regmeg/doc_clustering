2*4 NOTES.

21. Raplunt. They seize and bear him away in haste, sc. to

the camp. Cf. 29 : rapi in castra; and note, 26: rapturi.

22. Gaudiis. Plural to denote the various kinds and sources of

joy. Al. gladiis. But clamore et gaudiis is a much more natural

association of ideas, and accords especially with our author's remark­

able fondness for pairs of words of kindred signification. Cf. notes,

1, 84; 3, 20. See also clamore et gaudio in 2, 70.—Miracula. 1,23.

. 23. Animum ... sumpturi. Intending to make up their minds

(take sides) according to the result.

Ch. XXVIII.—2*. Stationem .... agebat. A cohort of infantry

and a company of horse kept guard at each gate of a Roman camp.

Julius Martialis was commander of this guard at the camp of the prae-

torians. Rup. «

25. Tribunus. This word originally denoted the head of a tribus

(from ires, three, the original number of tribes at Rome). Cf.Schmitz's

His. Rom. p. 60. It was afterwards applied to several classes of offi­

cers, such as tribunes of the commons and tribunes of the soldiers with

consular power. Here it denotes one of the Tribuni Militares, of

whom there were at this time six in iach legion, whose duty it was to

maintain order, keep guard, inspect outposts, &c. Cf. Smith's Diet.

Tribunus.—Js. Such, correlative to ut, which is accordingly followed

by the subj. denoting result.—Magnitudine = propter magnitudinem.

It is assigned as one of two possible reasons for the conduct of Martialis,

and limits rather the following sentiment than any particular word =

owing to the greatness of the unexpected crime. So Wr. and Rup.

Orelli aud Doderlein supply perculsus or some such idea from metuens

by zeugma = distracted by the greatness, etc., or fearing, etc.

Metuens assigns the other reason and governs castra as well as exi-

tium.

28. Dubiis et honestis. To measures of doubtful issue, though

in themselves virtuous and honorable. The author's analysis of the

habitus animorum of the masses here cannot but be admired ; and it

is capable of a wide application.

Cn. XXIX.—31. Sacris intentus. Cf. 27.—Fatigabat, sc. pre­

cious votisque = was importuning.

32. Alieiujam. Already another's, i. e. Otho's.

33. Iiicertum is neuter gender agreeing with a clause.—Quem

peretur. Borne away hastily. Cf. note, 5, 22: prono .... rapti.

Subj. in oratio obliqua.

34. Ex .... urbe, sc. concurrunt ad Galbam.—Ut . . . .fuerat

All those who had fallen in with Otho on his way to the camp. Cf

ut quisque, 26.—Formidine augentes. Through fear exaggerating

(sc. verum) the real danger. AI. formidinem. But formidine in the

Medicean MS., Dod., Or., &c. Cf. also 42: finxit formidine.
