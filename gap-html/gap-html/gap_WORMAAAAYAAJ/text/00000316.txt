312 NOTES.

I Ch. LXXXIV.—18. Pro. Primarily before ; hence, as here, tn

defence of, or in behalf of. Observe the conciseness, fecistis being

omitted. Cf. Essay, p. 14.

26. Fortissimus quietissimus. Ad rem., cf. Hom. Il.

2, 8 ; 4, 429.

33. Won hercule iill.... German1. Not even those German

barbarians, still less you. Hercule is too. ; sometimes mehercule,

which is an ellipsis for ita me, Hercule, juries (cf. Z. 361, note) ; or,

according to Freund, the me is only a demonstrative prefix for empha­

sis. Cf. Freund sub voce ce.—Cum maxime. Cf. note on it, 29.

35. Depoposcerint. Cf. 83: crediderim; 79: obstiterit. This

use of the subj. is much more frequent in the later than in the earlier

Latin. "Theperf. subj., when used independently, usually has the

meaning of a softened future." Z. 527. Zumpt suggests, by way of

explaining this meaning, that the same form is probably used both for

the subj. perf. and the subj. of the fut. perf., e. g. depoposcerim —

subj. both of depoposci and depoposcero. It does not necessarily im­

ply doubt. Cf. Cic. Brut. 6: Hoc sine ulla dubitatione confirmaverim,

etc. In such questions as this it implies a negative answer. Cf. note,

30: mererelur. The use of the perf. subj. after ut and ne (as in utque

sic dixerim, G. 2) is entirely peculiar to the silver age.

3T. Praestriiigimus = obumbramus. Al. perstringimus, which

is the reading of the MSS., and is retained by Rup. in the sense of

hebetamus. The departure from the MSS. is justified by Wr., from

the frequent and easy confounding of those two syllables.—Nationes,

imaginem .... exercitus, senatus. Notice the position of these em­

phatic words in their respective clauses.

> 2. Constiterint. Subj. as usual after the impers. verb. Cf. Gr.

'262, R. 3.

3. Domibus. Properly generic, = buildings; tectis, roofs. Ac­

cumulated here for emphasis, rather than for distinction. This speech

abounds in such emphatic accumulation of words nearly synonymous,

e. g. seditionem et discordiam, sanguinem et caedem, splendore et

gloria, sordes et obscuritatem.

-t. Stare = constare, consistere. Cf. Essay, pp. 10.11. Ad sen-  
tentiam, compare Liv. 5, 54 ; Dio. 56, 5.

5. Promiscua sunt, agreeing with muta ista in the nom.; instead

of promiscuum est agreeing with the clause. Render: whether these

mute and inanimate objects fall or are rebuilt is a matter of indif­

ference. It is a case of attraction, resembling the Greek. Cf. Essay,

p. 18.—Aeternitas rerum. The perpetuity of the empire.

T. Auspicato. The Romans undertook no great enterprise with­

out first ascertaining the will of the gods by auspices. Religion, deeply

seated in the breasts of the people, was the most powerful engine both

of war and of state. This speech is highly characteristic, and plays"
