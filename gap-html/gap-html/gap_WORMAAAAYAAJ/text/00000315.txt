BOOK I. 311

18. Populus, plebs. Cf. 35, and note, A. 43, where vulgus = gg

plebs here.—20. Ucinius Proculus et Plotius Firmus. Cf. 46.

22. Ut, with the suhj. denoting result.—Quina .... nummum.

Five thousand sesterces apiece. Nummum is gen. pi. for nummorum.

23. Tum. Then at length, then only. Used just as in chap. 66,

where see note.

25. Otium et salutem. Nam tribunus et centuriones a militi-

bus obtruncati. Cf. 80. Brotier. Doderlein takes it as a request to

be discharged, which derives some support from the abjectie .... in-

signibus, as well as from the frequent use of otium by T. as the oppo­

site of war. Cf. note, A. 11. But the use of salutem rather favors

the interpretation of Brotier and Rup. They demanded safety for

their persons, and order, tranquillity, in the camp. Otherwise (as

they intimated by casting off their badges) they could not retain their

offices.—Sensit invidiam. Felt the odium, or reproach, thus brought

upon themselves. Invidia—quod verbum ductum est a nimis intu-

endo fortuuam alterius. Cic. Tusc. Quaest. 3, 9.

36. Compositus. Used here and in 65, nearly in the sense of our

word composed, quieted, calmed. For other senses, cf. 47 and 71;

also A. 42 and 45, notes.

Ch. LXXXIII.—28. Q,uanquam non spectat ad sequens sed, ut

videtur Ernestio; consequens (apodosis) potius est hide a verbis: pos-

tremo ita disseruit. Wr. Ante postremo intelligendum tamen. Rup.

Quanquam turbidis rebus — quanquam turbidae res erant, etc.

30. Et plures = iiquo plures. Ernesli. " Always the greatest

number." Murphy.—Ambitioso imperio. Imperial power obtained

by solicitation of the multitude. Cf. note on ambitionem, 1.

3 2. Won posse .... retineri. Cf. the same sentiment prophet­

ically uttered in tho speech of Galba, 30.

34. Sed .... anxlus. Antithetic to simul reputans. Wr.

I. Tumultus .... iuitium, sc. excitatum est, implied in the an- gQ

tithetic clause nimia .... excitavit. So veni above is understood in

the first clause, and expressed only in the antithesis.

4. Acrius .... considerate. Al. consideratius. T. uses both

constructions. Cf. A. 4: vehementius quam caute ; 2, 24: avidius

quam consultius. The regular Latin construction is that with two

comparatives. Cf. Z. 690.

II. Etiam .... tribunosque. Even the centufions and tri­

bunes, much more common soldiers.—Tantum juberi. Receive com­

mands only, without reasons.

13. Et illie. Even there, i. e. under such circumstances, as

have been described.

15. Neque .... crediderim. For I cannot believe—would not

willingly, i. e. will not, believe. Cf. 79: obstiterit. The subj. pert

used to soften an assertion. Gr. 260, 11, R. 4; Z. 527.
