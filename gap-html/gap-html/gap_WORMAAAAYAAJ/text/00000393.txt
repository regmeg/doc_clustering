which follows.

25. Quern.... diximus. Cf. 3, 77. The crucifixion of this

modest sentiments (those becoming a citizen) touching himself, and

excellent sentiments in regard to the republic.

consular authority on the emperor's sons. Wr. It should bo added,

Emesti. To address the senate thus (on the general interests of the

state) was not in character for a private citizen. Cf. note, 2, 55:
