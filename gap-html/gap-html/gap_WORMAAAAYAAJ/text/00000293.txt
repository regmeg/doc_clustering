BOOk i. 289

—Quisque, after a superlative, = omnes with the positive with a little

more of the distributive idea. Constructed in Cicero with singular

verb; in Tacitus with singular or plural. Z. 367 and 710, b.

21. Fatigari. Pressed with hard labor by the centurions.—

Emeret. Simple for compound (redimeret). Cf. Essay, p. 11. Bo­

lides avoiding the repetition of redimere, emere suggests the idea of a

tale by the centurions for filthy lucre. See Or. in loc.

25. Bella civilia is governed by ad before seditiones. Some

editors insert in; but it is not necessary to depart from the MSS. See

a similar construction in legiones ducesque, 4; also Essay, p. 12.

26. Vulgi. Common soldiers. In its etymology, vulgus is our

word folk, German, volk.—Largitione, i. e. remissione vacationum

Vulgi is objective genitive = in vulgus.

29. Tanquam .... seponeretur. Under color of banishment.

Seponere is not used in this sense in the Augustan age. Otho gave

out that Laco was banished, but sent a man to put him to death.

Palam in the next clause is opposed to this clandestine procedure.

31. Confossus. He was stabbed on his way from Rome towards

his place of banishment. His having left Rome is not stated, but im­

plied iu the pregnant style of the author. Cf. Essay, p. 18.

3 2. I,ibertum. Ernesti insists on liberlinum. But in the age of

Tacitus, the distinction between these words (for which see note, G.

25) was not observed.

Ch. XLVII.—33. Novissimum. Like our word last, which =

latest, or newest, and also farthest, last in a series. Cf. note, G. 24.

34. Vocat.... urbanus. The consuls, Galba and Vinius, were

slain; the consul elect also, Marius Celsus, was in irons. The Prae­

tor Urbanus was the first in rank of the praetors (of whom there were

some twelve or fifteen under the emperors), and the chief magistrate

for the administration of justice. His duties confined him to the city.

In the absence or death of the consuls, he, as in this instance, dis­

charged the functions of a consul. Cf. 4, 39 ; Cic. Ep. ad Div. 10,12.

Praetor was in early times the name for any magistrate or leader

(prae-itor). Manual, P. 3, 243. The consuls were originally called

praetors. Cic. Leg. 3, 3. Cf. Nieb. and Am. Rom. His.

1. Omisisset. Passed them over entirely.—Distulisset. Deferred 52

the punishment of them. Subj. Cf. Gr. 265 ; Z. 552.

4. Permisit and concedi are not tautology. He gave permission

to his officers that the bodies should be yielded to the friends.

6. Composuere. Buried, properly, arranged or adorned for burial;

a sense peculiar to Tacitus with the poets. Cf. Boetticher and Freund

sub voce.

Ch. XLVIII.—8. Explebat. Was filling out, i. e. had nearly

completed, though Ernesti and Wr. make it = expleverat.
