264 NOTES.

If

gg should not be alarmed: 1. The circumstances attending Galba's ac­

cession to the supreme power; 2. The fact that the only objection

against Galba is now removed.

35. Jieque . . . . et. Correlative, as in 15 To exhort you fur­

ther, in the first place suits not the present occasion, and in the next

place there is no need of it, the necessity being superseded by the

happy choice he had made in Piso.

3T. Idem ac = as well as.—Bonarum .... rcrum, i. e. between

good and bad measures.

20 2. Regiiantur. Governed by kings. Poetice. Cf. Virg. Aen.

6, 794 ; and note, G. 25j et al.

3. Qui nec totam, etc. T. here gives us at a stroke an exact

picture of the Romans in that age. His Annals and History are from

beginning to end a commentary on this text .

5. Tanquam .... faceret, i. e. with deliberation and dignity—

tanquam cum facto, sc. principe: the rest talked with Piso as with

one already made princeps, i. e. with eager and servUe flattery.

This speech of Galba is worthy to be studied, as a manual of moral

and political wisdom. Every sentence is a maxim for the world and

all time. Yet it is all especially befitting the aged and experienced

Galba in an address to his adopted son. See Life of T., p. 13.

11. Quasi imperare, etc. Another single stroke, that reveals

a whole character, and a noble character too, whose self-respect com­

subj.cf.Gr.S63, 2; Z. S72.

12. Pro rostris, i. e. in the forum, before the people ; in castris,

i. e. to the soldiers of the Praetorian Guard.

13. In castra, for the army had the power, not the senate or

the people. Observe the difference between in castra and in castris.

Gr. 235, 2 ; Z. 316.

14. Ut Ita. Antithetic. Cf. 4. The infinitives in this

sentence depend on a verb understood (they said, they thought), and

express the motive for going to the camp. The subj. usually stands

in the dependent clauses of such sentences (oratio obliqua). Cf. Gr.

266, 2; Z. 603.

15. Per bonas artes. Sub. acquisitum.

16. Publica exspectatio .... Impatiens. Abstract for con­

crete, poetice, = populus impatienter exspectans.
