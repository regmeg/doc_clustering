NOTES.

ggCelsus a fear as to the sincerity of the reconciliation, he treated him

at once as a most intimate friend, i. e. as if there were no need of

reconciliation. This is substantially Ritter's view of this much disputed

passage. Dod. follows the same reading and gives essentially the

same interpretation, but thinks the text requires some amendment.

Other readings and other interpretations have been suggested too nu­

merous to mention. But none of them give so good a sense as this,

and none rest on much, if any, better authority of MSS. The reading

of Wr., Rup. and Or., with several of the best MSS., is this: sed, ne

hostes metueret, conciliationes adhibens.

31. Fora. Market-places. Besides the Forum emphatically so

called, i. e. the Forum Romanum between the Palatine and Capitoline

hills, there were several large fora in which public business was trans­

acted, such as the Forum Julii, Forum Augusti, Forum Trajani, etc.;

besides which there were smaller market-places set apart each for

some particular trade and named accordingly, e. g. forum boarium,

olitorium, piscarium, etc. The word forum is allied to foras, and sig­

nifies properly an open place, whether before some building or sur­

rounded by temples, porticoes and other edifices. Cf. Smith's Diet, of

Antiq., Forum.—Ubi refers to circum ac theatra.
