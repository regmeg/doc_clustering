at the grotesque and monstrous figures in Egyptian sculpture and 2J7

painting, and you will be at no loss to understand the force of effigies

compositas. Cf. note on Hammonis, 4, supra.—Judaei mente, etc.

Cf. G. 9 : sola reverentia, and note ibid. We have here a sublime

idea of one great, supreme and governing Mind ; of one omnipotent,

eternal God. It is astonishing that T. did not pause in deep reflection

upon what he could so well describe. Murphy. Ad verba, cf. Essay,

p. 17.

lO. ImitaMle. The common editions have mutabile. But that

is included in interiturum. Cf. Wr. in loc.

13. Sed quia. The force of quia extends to reperta, and the

apodosis commences with Liberum.

14. Hedera. The Jews had not so much as a name for ivy in

their language. But they bore branches of willow and other trees at

the feast of Tabernacles. Cf. Rup. in loc.—Vitisque aurea. A vine

wrought in pure gold of a thousand talents' weight is mentioned by

Josephus, as an ornament. Cf. Ant. J. 15, 11.—Templo for in tcmplo.

Cf. Essay, p. 12.

15. I,iberum Patrem. Properly the old Italian god of planting,

particularly of the vine, though the name is often applied by the Ro­

man poets to the Greek Bacchus, as it is here by T. The name is

probably derived front liberare. Cf. Diet. Biog. and Mythol. Others

dorive it from libare.

Ch. VI.—19. Terra flnesque = fines torrae. The boundaries

of the country.

20. Phoenlces. The people put for the country, as Gallis, etc.

G. 1.

21. Septentriouem prospectant, sc. terra finesque, lit . the

frontiers look towards the north for a great distance alongside of Syria,

i. o. the northern frontier stretches for a long distance on the confines

of Syria. Cf. 3, 60 : locus late prospectans. Notice the etymology

of septentrionem in the lexicon.

23. Rari Imbres. True of the summer. The winter is the rainy

season in the East .

2*« Paimetis. Dat. of possession after sunt understood.

26. Pavent venae. A fiction of course. Till the present cen­

tury, the East has always been to Europeans the land of romance.

2T. Praecipuum .... erigit, sc. terra. Libanum is acc. after

erigit. Cf. G. 27: sepulcrum caespes erigit. The reader will ob­

serve the highly poetical turn of expression in this, as also in many

other phrases here, e. g. pavent venae, fidumque nivibus, Jordancm

alit, volucres patitur, fugit cruorem. T. is very fond of poetical de­

scriptions. Compare that of Britain, A. 10, and notes ibid. It may be

attractive, but it is one of those dulcia vitia which should not be imitated.

Far preferable is the simplicity of Cresar and the Greek historians.
