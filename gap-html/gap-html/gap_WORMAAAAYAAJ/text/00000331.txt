13. Viae, sc. Postumiae.—Lucis. Cf. note, ad verbum. G. 9. gy

18. Vexillum, i. e. the vexillaries of the 13th legion.

19. Aggerem viae. The high-way, the elevated road. • Cf.

Fiske's Man. 1, 52, where seethe construction of Roman roads.

20. Dextra fronte, i. e. dextro corau. Cf. Curt. 4, 13. Ob­

serve, that auxiliaries were placed on either wing, as the Roman

allies were in the earliest wars of the republic.

Ch. XXV.—25. Prudens = providens, which has the same

etymology

26. Exsurgentes, sc. ex insidiis, i. e. lucis viae imminenti-

bus, 24.

27. Ultro = insuper, furthermore; so Rup. But better per­

haps : of their own accord, i. e. by their own act. Cf. note, G. 28.

28. Adversa frons. This is the reading of Wr., Bach, Rit.,

Rup., Dod., Or. and the best MSS. Al. fronte. The sense is the

same. Supply erat: literally, the opposing front was (composed) of

legionary soldiers, for so we must take legionum here as in 22 (where

see note), for there was but one entire legion under command of

Paullinus, viz. the first. Cf. 24.

30. Cui placerent = talis, at, etc. Cf. Gr. 264, 1;

Z. 556.

31. Fossas. Wr. and Bach understand this of the ditches by

the roadside, and refer to 41: praervptis utrimque fossis, etc. But

most editors understand it of agricultural ditches for draining, and

refer in proof to 3, 21: agresti fossa. The latter accords better with

aperiri campum, which denotes the clearing and levelling of the

fields. •

34. Vilieas .... impeditas. Vineyards thick with interwoven

branches. Murphy. Or. remarks that even now, in that part of

Italy, vines are planted between trees, and interlock their branches.

37. Rex Epiphanes. Non proprie rox, sed Antiochi regis Com-

mageni filius (crown prince). Cf. Joseph. B. 9. 7, 7. Sic et infra,

5, 9, rex Pacorus pro regis filio. Wr.

Ch. XXVI.—5. Abriperet. Observe the force of ab : bore away, gg

i. c. along with the panic-stricken fugitives. Subj. after cum causalis.

6. Quod . ducerentur. Cf. note, 19 : quod .... legisset.—

Praefectus castrorum. There was one prefect of the camp to each

legion, whose duty it was to attend to the making of the camp, and

its whole internal economy. (Vegetius, 2, 10). This office is first

mentioned in the reign of Augustus. Cf. Smith's Die.

7. Fratri .... ageret. For the moro common expression: cum

fratre de proditione ageret.

13. Percrebruerit. It was a general remark. For the pert

subj. cf. note, 1, 24: dederii.

14. Insuper = additional. Adv. for adj.
