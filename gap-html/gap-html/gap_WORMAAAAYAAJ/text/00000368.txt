864 NOTES.

Plgl

—Hint majores, etc. The sense of this concise passage is very weB

expressed by Murphy thus : hence the shadows of men and horses

projected forward to such a length, that the Vitellians, deceived by

appearances, aimed at a wrong mark. Their darts by consequence

fell short of their aim. The moonbeams, in the mean time, played

on the front of their lines and gave their bodies in full view to the

adverse army, who fought behind their shadows as if concealed in

obscurity.

135 XXIV.—3. Cur. Interrogative particle = cui rei ? Z. 276,

2.—Rursus, sc. after having been already defeated in that very field

of Bedriacum, as he goes on to say.

8. Tolerent. Al. tolerarent, a mere conjecture of Ernesti. If

you cannot bear, as it now appears you cannot; it is not a mere sup­

position or conception as tolerarent would denote, but a fact. So Wr.,

Rup. and Bek.

10. Sub PartUos. a. u. c. 710. Cf. Dio. 49, 22-33.

11. Sub.... Armenios. Cf. Ann. 15, 26 ; also note, 6, supra.—

Nuper Sarmatas. 1, 79.

12. Infeusus. So all the MSS. The common editions have in-

fensius. But infensus of itself in the connection denotes peculiar

violence in the manner of addressing these troops, bearing down upon

them and striking against them, as it were (in-fendo). So Bach and

Wr.

13. Pagaui. Peasants, not soldiers, for if defeated here, who

will employ such troops. Paganus, from pagus, a term of reproach,

somewhat like villain from villa.

1*. Illle. There, among the followers ofVitellius, to whom ycu re­

signed them, when you were dismissed. Cf. 2, 67: arma... deferebant.

There are your standards and arms, and you may regain them or die, as

you please—there is no other alternative ; for you have already exhaust­

ed ignominy in all its forms, and if conquered now, it is certain death.

Such is the meaning of this singularly sententious and energetic address.

16. Ill Syria, where the third legion had served under Corbulo,

as intimated above, before they were transferred to Moesia.

Ch. XXV.—18. Vagus. Flying, accidental, antith. to consilio

.... subditus.

21. Ut... . coutraheret, etc. The subj. here assigns a reason

for rariore. Gr. 264, 8; Z. 564.

22. Pulsos. So all the MSS. Al. impulsos and repulsos. But

cf. note, 1, 2: missa; and Essay, p. 11.

25. Per limitem viae. Cf. note, chap. 21, supra.

26. Eo is correl. to quia. For this reason, viz. because.

2T. Vlpstaiio Messalla. A cotemporary historian and eye-witness.

Cf. note, 9, supra.

33. Placatos manes. Al. piatos. But placatos, with the
