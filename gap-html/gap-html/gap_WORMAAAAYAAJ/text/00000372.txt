peated occurrence. Cf. Gr. 2G4, 12 ; Z. 569.—Quis ... conspicuus,

bc. puer, as the gender and the antithesis of virgo sufficiently indicate

without inserting the word. So Ernesti. Gronovius would read out

puer instead of aut quis. What a state of morals is here shadowed

forth!

say, pp. 10. 11.

11. Faces in manibus. Acc. after habentcs understood, as the

Greeks omit the part, of ?xw- Matthiae, p. 588, Ed. 1. Rup. So we

say in English, " torch in hand."

14. Interesseiit. For the subj., cf. Gr. 264, 8 ; Z. 564.

IT. Mefltis was the goddess that was worshipped in all places

that sent forth noxious exhalations. Hence we read in Virgil: Sa-

cramque exhalat opaca Mefitim. Aen. 7, 64. Murphy.

This portion of the history furnishes a very good illustration of our

author's characteristic power of description. The rapid succession of

bloody battles and sieges, in which Antonius and his followers fought

like tigers, nay like demons, through two days and the intervening

night, defeated three separate armies in three successive encounters

without intermission, and carried two distinct and strongly fortified

lines of defence—walls, towers and bulwarks—around Cremona, is

sketched with a rapidity and force fully adequate to the subject. The

outward movements and the inward motives of tho men are set before

the eye of the reader with equal distinctness. And finally the burning

and sacking of the city presents a picture of unrestrained passions, of

unbounded crimes, of dreadful calamities and sufferings, of utter deso*

lation and ruin, to which history and even the drama with all its wild

license of imagined horrors can furnish few parallels. The student,

who has failed to perceive the historian's power, has read" the passage

to little purpose, and will do well to read it again. In default of all

other means of appreciating it, he will find the passage well represent­

ed in Murphy's translation, though not with all the conciseness, force

and fire of the original. Cf. Life of T. pp. 9-10; and Preliminary

Remarks, p. 238.

Ch. XXXIV.—20. Condita erat. It was established, sc. as a

colony. The town existed before. Brotier.—Tiberio .. . consulibus,

i. e. a. v. c. 536. Cf. Liv. 21, 6.

»3. Rueret. Al. irruerct. Cf. Essay, pp. 10. 11. As to this

design of the colony, cf. Liv. 21, 25 Polyb. 3, 40.
