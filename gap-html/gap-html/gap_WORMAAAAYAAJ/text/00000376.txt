16. Paratu .... rumore. Cf. a like ant. of paratu and fama,

A. 25, with the same collocation of words, vii. the noun standing first

in the first clause, but the adj. or part, in the second clause, as the

emphasis requires: in reality (the real array) strong, and made still

stronger by report.

bant. Cf. note, A. 18 : volentlbus erat. Z. 420.

Spain. Cf. note, 1, 16: una legione.

9. Exemcre tamen. Though the battles were of various issue

(i. e. not decidedly successful in re-establishing Cartismandua on the

throne), yet they at least rescued the queen from personal danger.

the first clause, so that tamen really stands here, as usual, near the

beginning of its own member of the sentence.

Ch. XLVI.—12. Perfidia social1. By the treachery of the

states in alliance.
