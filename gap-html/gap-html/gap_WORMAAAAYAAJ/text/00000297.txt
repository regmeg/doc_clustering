they already devoured in imagination.—Super avaritiam, is to be

connected with irritati.

18. Remissam .... donatos, sc. with Roman citizenship and the

lands of their neighbors. Cf. chap. 8. Instead of et donatos, the edi­

tions which follow Oborlin and the Bipontiiies have eos damnatos, a

mere conjecture.

%0. In ignominlam exercitus, sc. Germanici. This clause should

be connected with jactabant. The Gauls boasted, to the disgrace of

the German army, that a fourth part, etc. Cf. Orelli's note in loc.—

Accessit. Cf. note, 5: accessit vox.

21. Decumari = decumatum iri. So dimitti = were to be dis­

33. Ill majus, i. e. quasi Vitellius non consularis legatus, sed ipse
