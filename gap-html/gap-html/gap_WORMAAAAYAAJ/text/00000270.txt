NOTES.

3*. Perdidisseut. The subj. denoting the view of the soldier*

not the sentiments of the author.

35. Nocuit. Hurt his cause, ruined his popularity. Ci.nocu-

isse, 21.

36. Rigor occurs in Boettichor's list of words belonging to the

poets of an earlier age. It is not found in Cicero. Cf. Freund sub voce

Ch. XIX.—3T. Ihde. Thence or next, sc. they proceeded to the

senate, of which there is an ellipsis. Tacitus in his conciseness has

put two clauses into one. Cf. note, A. 5: prima .. . approbavit;

also Essay on the Style of Tacitus, p. 18.

1. Multi.... obsequlo. Al. pointed and read thus: multi vo-

luntate 5 effusius qui noluerant; medii, ac plurimi, obvio obsequio.

But medii is a conjectural reading; and this punctuation destroys the

proper antithesis, which is usually the best clue to the understanding

of Tacitus: many out of cordial good-will expressed their approbation

(favebant understood) freely and fully ; those who were opposed (to the

nomination), in moderate (ordinary, commonplace) tert^; and a still

greater number (the major part) with ready complaisance, cherishing

hopes of personal advantage (from Piso's elevation) without regard

to the public welfare. Medie, with the exception of this one passage

in Tacitus, occurs only in the brazen or post-classical age. Cf. Or. in

loco and Frouud sub voce. ,

7. Cum tristia sunt. Highly descriptive of the morbid state of

the public mind.—Censuerant, had voted, sc. prior to the discussion

which follows.

8. Agitatum secreto. By Galba among his friends and coun­

sellors.

9. Jfum .... proiicisceretur. Subj. of the indirect question.

Cf. Gr. 265; Z. 552.—Majore praetextu. Ut major legationis dignitaa

esset et auctoritas. Ernesti. So it seems to be explained by the clause

which follows. Praetextus in this sense (= species, auctoritas) is

post-Augustan. Cf. Boetticher.

13. Foeda Inconstantia. With shameful inconstancy (want of

firmness), on the part of Galba.

1*. Ambitu. Ob ambitum, sive cupiditatem pravam gratia nix-

am. So it is well explained in the Bipontine edition. Render: jrc (or

through) their solicitous desire of going or remaining.

Ch. XX.—IT. Ubl.... causa erat. Al. unde. But that is a

mere interpolation, and, as Wr. says, an inappropriate one; for the

cause of a want of money lay in the extravagant donations of Nero,

not from them.

18. Bis .... sestertium. Twenty-two hundred million sester­

ces. Cf. Roman money, Gr. 327, 6. Summa ilia sane grandiuscula,

Bed digna effusionibus ejus monstri. Lipsius.

19. Singulos, sc. a Nerone donatos. Rup.—Decuma ... relicta.
