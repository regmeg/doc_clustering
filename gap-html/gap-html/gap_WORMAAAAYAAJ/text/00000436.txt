432 NOTES.

222 3> 42: proximo litorum ; Ann. 3, 1: proxima maris; Sall. Jug. 48 s

fluminis propinqua loca; Lucr. 4, 339: propior caliginis aer. So

Wr. Others take propiora fluminis to mean the parts of the river

nearer the bank, where the Germans could fight to advantage (cf. 14),

and whence they might annoy the flank of the Romans. So Freund

seems to understand it. Vid. sub voce. Cf. note, 2: propiora Syriae.

19. Cerialis, sc. memorat.

20. Ut. .. excidcrent. Al. exscinderent. Wr., Dod. and many

others place a colon after exeiderent, and make it depend on a verb

of entreaty or command understood. But such a verb is not appropri­

ate to the previous clause ; and in such a case the ut would be omitted.

Cf. 3, 5: celeraret; 3, 10: injieerent; 3, 68: retinerent, et passim.

23. Quod roboris fuerit. This clause is in app. with Germanos.

The Germans constituted all the real strength of Civilis.

25. Proprios .... legionibus. We learn from 4, 68, that the

14th legion had been summoned from Britain ; the 6th from Spain,

where it seems to have taken the lead in proclaiming Galba emperor

(cf. 1, 4); and the 2d was a recently enlisted legion—hence ilia pri-

mum acie .... nova signa, etc.

29. Praevectus. Passing along the lines, before (prae) the le­

gions.—Manus tendebat. As a sign of entreaty. Cf. 1, 36.

Ch. XVII.—34. Silcntem... aciem, i. e. he not only addressed his

troops, as Cerialis had addressed the Romans, but they responded with

shouts. Or. Ita dicimus silent vel tacitum iter facere. Wr.—Locum,

sc. Vetera. Cf. 14, and notes there.

223 Dum .. .. Impediunt. The general rule requires the subj. ia

such dependent clauses in the oratio obliqua. Cf. Gr. 266, 2; Z. 603-

But when the dependent clause expresses a fact independent of the

speaker's opinion, it is put in the hid. Gr. 266, 2, R. 5 ; Z. 603.

5. Gnaros, in the passive sense (known to) is found only in T.—

Rhenum .... deos. Probably Civilis means to speak of the Rhine as

a divinity, and so it is represented on some ancient coins. See a sim­

ilar appeal to the sun and stars, as divinities, by a German chief, in

Ann. 13, 55, and Grote's note on the same, Hist. Greece, vol. i. p. 465.

The word Rhein = a stream, in Celtic or old German.

6. Capesserent. Subj. for the imp. of the oratio recta. Z. 603, c.

9. Ita mos. Cf. G. 11.

11. Neque .... et. Correl. Our soldiers on the one hand not

entering the marsh (cf. 14. 15, supra), and the Germans on the other

assailing them (saxis glandibusque) to draw them off, sc. into the

marsh.

Ch. XVIII.—16. Q,uam .... retulimus. Cf. 14, supra, where

and in 15, see incidents similar to and illustrative of those here nar­

rated. ■

20. Terga .... promittens. Lit. promising him the rear of the
