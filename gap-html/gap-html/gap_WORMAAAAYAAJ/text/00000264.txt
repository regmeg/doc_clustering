260 NOTES.

gg bilissimarum equestriumquo gentium familiare, nou deducendum i

Marte sed fortasse a Marcus, i. e. Masculus, v. Voss. fitym." Wisso-

wa, cited by Ruperti.

25. Rebus miuoribus. In matters of less importance, antith.

to circa consilium, etc. In is omitted before the abl. here for the

sake of brevity. Cf. Essay on the Style of Tacitus, p. 12.

26. Circa = in respect to. Cf. G. 28. " Circa apud T. = de

et in apud Cic." Bach.

27 • Scindebantur, in this sense, is poetical (cf. Boetticher) and

Virgilian. Cf. Virg. Aen. 2, 39.

28. Consensu .... allum. Agreed in supporting, not so much

any particular one (cf. unum aliquem, 6), as some other, than Otho.

32. Subisse, sc. animum Galbae. Cf. 37: horror animuim subit.

Render: influenced. The word implies a silent, secret influence.

Cf.A.3.

33. Relinqueretur, sc. quasi hereditate. Rup. For the mode

and tense, cf. Gr. 261, 1; Z. 524.

34. Otho. Cf. Ann. 13,45.46; Suet . Otho; and Plut. Galba

and Otho.

35. Eo = ideo.

36. Jam, antith. to max, denotes time = already.

3T. Octaviam .... amoliretur. He divorced her on a charge

of adultery, and afterwards put her to death. Ann. 14, 60—64. The

subj. after donee here is according to the general rule (cf. Gr. 263, 4;

Z. 575), for here it refers to a purpose or object to be attained. But

Tacitus disregards this distinction, and uses the subj. after donee lefer-

ring to a mere fact, e. g. 4, 35: pugnatum, donee proelium nox diri-

meret; 1, 35: donee .... levaretur, where see note.

38. Suspect um .... Poppaea. Cf. Ann. 13, 46, where the

character of this accomplished but depraved woman is sketched, and

a full account is given of her relation to Otho and Nero, which how­

ever cannot bo reconciled with this passage in the Histories. Accord­

ing to the later and doubtless more correct account in the Annals,

Poppoea was the wife of Otho, from whom she was taken by Nero.

1. I,usitaniam. A part of Spain, now Portugal. Hence the

name which the great Portuguese poet, Camoens, gave his poem in

honor of his country, viz. the Lusiad.—Specie legationis. He ban­

ished him under pretence of conferring upou him an honorable office.

Hence Otho speaks of it, as honor exsilii, 21. Cf. also Ann. 13, 46.

—Comiter. Civiliter et populariter.—Administrata. 10 years. Suet

Otho, 3.

2. Partes, sc. Galba's.

3. Praesentes, sc. in provincia duces. Rup.

5. Rapicbat denotes the impetuosity with which he seized upon

and cherished the hope. Cf. Virg. Aen 1,176: rapuitque fiammanu
