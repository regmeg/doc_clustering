I

8. Afferret. Subj. after quod in place of dummodo id. Cf. Gr.

264, 2 ; Z. 555, = provided he did not himself propose it.

Ch. XXVII.—8. Pro acde. ' Before the temple of Apollo. Aedes

= a sacred edifice consecrated by the act of man; templum = a

temple (or other holy place) sanctioned by the appointment of the

gods, who made known their will through the augurs. Cf. Smith's

Diet., word Templum. The temple of Apollo was on the Palatine

Mount. Cf. Horace: Palatinus Apollo.—Haruspex. The haruspices

were introduced from Etruria, and were different both from the augu-

res and the sacerdotes. They were regarded by the educated in the

age of Cic. as a sort of jugglers (Dio. 2, 24). Claudius attempted

to revive their credit. Cf. Ann. 11, 15, where Tacitus speaks of a

collegium haruspicum.

13. Redemptoribus. Contractors.

15. Requireutibus. Dat. after finxisset, which is connected by

cum to innixus .... pergit.—Praedia signifies an estate, whether in

the city or the country, aud usually implies buildings in the city style.

Here the idea of the buildings is prominent. Hence vetustate sus-

pecta, of questionable value oh account of their age. Hence also

exploranda, sc. by the architect and the contractors. Suet. (Oth. 6)

expresses the same thus: quasi veualem domum inspecturus.

IT. Tiberianamdomum. A Tiberio domui Augusti additam id

occidentali montis Palatini parte. Brotier.—Velabrum. Planities inter

forum Romanian, et Palatinum, Capitolinum Aventinumque montes.

Rup. Varro (Ling. Lat. 5, 5) derives the name from vehere ; but D6-

derlein refers it to <UtT#ap, for it was the locality of the oil merchants.

—Milliarium aureum. Columna aurea^ ab Augusto in capite fori

facta, in quam militares viae omnes ex Italia desinebant . Rup; The

milestones along the Roman roads were called milliaria. But the

miles were not reckoned from the milliarium aureum, but from the

gates of the city. Cf. Smith's Diet.; and Kingsley in loco: also Fiske's

Man. P. 1, 52.

18. Aedem. Al. Aede. But sub here denotes tendency to a

place near the temple, and requires tho acc. Cf. Gr. 235, (2).—Per­

git. He proceeds (per and rego). It properly belongs only to the

last stage of Otho's progress. Cf. pergeret, in chap. 18, and note

ibid. It applies only by zeugma (Gr. 323, 1, (2); Z. 775) to the first

stage, sc. in Velabrum. Pergit is historical present, and hence, like

the perf. for which it stands, is followed by the pluperf. subj. (finxis­

set). Cf. Gr. 258, R. 1; Z. 501.

20. Sellae. The sella gestatoria was a sedan, usually covered

(adoperta, cf. Suet. Aug. 53); it was different from the lectica, which

was a litter or portable bed, and in which the person carried lay in a

recumbent posture. Cf. Becker's Gallus and Smith's Diet, of Antiq.

Suetonius (Oth. G) calls this of Otho a sella muliebris.
