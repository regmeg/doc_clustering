boOK I. 269

IB. to gratify curiosity and ambition, which are stronger than law. As

to the unexpected turn of expression here, cf. Monboddo on Language,

2, 4, 12.

22. Secreta. Private apartments, or secret conclaves. It is

used in both sonses by Tacitus. Cf. notes, A. 22 and 39.—Pessimum

.. instrumentum. The basest means of bringing about her mar­

riage to the emperor, Nero. Cf. notes on chap. 13. Burnouf and Orelli

render: the detestable implement of imperial housewifery.

23. Ptolemaeus. Cf. Plut. Galb. In Suet. Oth. 4. 6, called by

mistake Seleucus, which was the name of Vespasian's mathematicus.

24.' Cum .... promisisset. Plup. subj. in narration. Cf. Gr.

263, E. 2; Z. 578.

25. Postquam .... fides, sc. ei erat. After confidence was re­

posed in him from its turning out, as he had predicted.

29. Credendi. Al. credi, which is found in all the MSS., and

which, according to Wr., may depend on cupidine, as sequi does on

natura in 55: insita mortalibus natura propere sequi. Yet Wr. himself

reads credendi (as also Dod. and Or.), and the active seems much

more appropriate here than the passive.

Ch. XXIII.—30. Et sceleris. The criminal act also, i. e. as

well as the criminal desire (ejus modi voto). Et for etiam is very

rare in Cicero, but common in Livy and later writers. Cf. Z. 698;

and Kiihner ad Cic. Tusc. Quaes. 1, 17, 40.—Instinctor is found only

in Tacitus and writers still later than he. Cf. Boetticher.

31. Ad .... transitur states a general principle (as Tacitus al­

ways loves to do in connection with historical facts) which Murphy

thus freely translates: " The heart, that has formed the wish and con­

ceived the project, has seldom any scruple about the means."

32. Repens. Tacitus alone uses this word in the sense of recent.

Thus in Ann- 6, 7, it stands opposed to vetustate obscurum. So here «

it is explained by the antithetic jampridem. Cf. Or. in loc. and Freund's

Lex. sub voce.

33. Successionis, sc. by adoption. Cf. 13.—Facinoris. Acts of

violence, forcible seizure of the throne.

34. In agmllie. Ernesti objects, that in agmine is identical with

in itinere. But Wr. replies, that Tacitus uses the words together else­

where, e. g. Ann. 3, 9: in agmine atque itinere ; and that in general

agmen denotes the troops on the march, and iter the march itself.

Here, however, he says in agmine is antithetic to in stationibus, and

he explains in agmine by ubi copiae essent conjunctae; and in sta­

tionibus by ubi singuli milites versarentur. Doderlein says: in itinere,

dum iter faciunt; in agmine, dam ambulant, exercendi causa. Orelli

-has still another way of distinguishing the phrases. Render in itinere,  
on the march; in agmine, in the lines; in stationibus, at theii

quarters.
