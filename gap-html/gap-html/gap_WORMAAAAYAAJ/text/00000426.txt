422 NOTES.

ff

21g 34. Allenarum = alienigenarum, the women of foreign nations.

For the reason of this exclusiveness, see note, 4: quo sibi, etc.

35. Iuter .... lllicitum. But compare the precepts of the dec

alogue, Exod. 20, 14. 17; also the severe punishment of adulterers;

Deut . 22, 13-29.—Circumcidere .... noscantur. Yet we are by

no means to understand, that circumcision was entirely peculiar to the

Jews. It prevailed among the Egyptians, Ethiopians, Colchians,

Arabs, Armenians and other oriental nations. Cf. Herod. 2, 36. 104;

Diod. 1, 28; Strab. lib. 17; Joseph. Ant . Jud. 8, 10; 12, 5. Its ex­

tensive prevalence implies a physical reason for it, which doubtless

exists in those warm climates. On this subject, see a good collection

of facts aud authorities in Kitto's Bib. Cyclop., art. Circumcision.

36. Transgressi .... eorum. Proselytes.

3T. Idem, sc. circumcision.—Quicquam .... imbuuntur. This

verb usually and properly takes an abl. after it. But it is here followed

by an acc., as if a verb of teaching: nor are they taught any thing.

38. Parentes is the object of habere.—Vilia. Worthless things.

2. Et necare. Et = both, correl. to que, for both the clauses of

this sentence stand related to the increase of population and the desire

of offspring among the Jews.—Agnatis. Superfluous children, i. e.

those born after there was already a sufficient number of heirs, which

were put to death by the Romans. Cf. note, G. 19.

3. Animos .... acternos. So Medicean MS., Or. and Dod. Al.

animas aeternas.—Proelio .. . peremptorum. Those who fell in bat­

tle or were put to death by their Greek and Roman oppressors were

especially incited by the hope of immortality, e. g. the Maccabees and

their followers. Cf. 2 Mac. 7. 9. 36. But those Jews who held the

doctrine in respect to any, doubtless held it in respect to all.

-t. Corpora ... Aegyptio. They bury their dead after the man­  
ner of the Egyptians, rather (magis understood) than burn them.

Burning was the custom of the Romans under the emperors and in

the latter ages of the republic. The earlier Romans buried their dead.

Both usages prevailed among the Greeks. Cf. Diet. Antiq., Funus.

The Jews embalmed (like the Egyptians, though with less care) and

buried. Cf. Gen. 50, 2. 26 ; John, 19, 39. 40 ; Kit. Bib. Cycl., Burial.

5. Eademque ... persuasio. And they have the same anxiety

and firm belief touching the lower world, sc. as the Egyptians.

6. Coelestium contra, sc. persuasio est. In respect to the gods,

their belief is opposite to that of the Egyptians. For a similar use of

contra, cf. 2, 97: experimentum contra fuit. Wr. joins these words

to the following, and governs coelestium by pleraque.

7. Pleraque. Very many. Cf. note, 1, 39, and A. 1.—Animalia.

Such as the bull of Memphis, the crocodile of Arsinoe, the ibis, the ich­

neumon, etc. Cf. Juv. 15, 1, seq.; Herod. 2, 40.—Effigies compositas.
