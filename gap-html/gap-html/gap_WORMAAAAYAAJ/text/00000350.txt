346 NOTES.

1(JQ reference to time. Observe here, as in so many otherplaces, the pain

of words nearly synonymous: abiit et transvectum est, sopor et igna-

via, ardoris ac ferociae, popinis et commissationibus. The sentiment

of this and the following clause is: it is too late for you to hope that

you will merely seem (videri is emphatic) to have coveted the throne;

nobody doubts that you have, and now the throne is your only place of

refuge and safety.

23. NulHs stipendiis. Without military experience.—Galbae

odio. The hatred of the soldiers towards Galba.

24. tie Othonem .... fecit. Two distinct thoughts are blended

in this sentence: 1. Otho was not conquered by the skill of Vitellius

or the power of his army, but, etc.; 2. Even Otho is now regretted

and honored in comparison with Vitellius. Cf. note, chap. 69: apud

.... stetit.

26. Spargit ministrat. Cf. 66 and 67. The disarmed

praetorians and disbanded legions carried with them the spirit of disaf­

fection.

old.

HQ 2. Ccdere imperio. Cedere, to give up, takes the dat. of the

person with either the acc. or abl. of the thing. Cf. Z. 413.

8. Hos .... illi. Hos hore refers to the former, illi to the latter.

Cf. Gr. 207, R. 23.

1, 44. Recludet is peculiar to poetry and post-Augustan proso.

12. Parsimonia. Economy, which provides the sinews of war.

Cf. 84.

14. Q,ui deliberaut, desciverunt. Cf. A. 15; Plut. Galb. 4,

same sentiment. This speech well befits a politician, such as Mucia- •

nus is described to be, chap. 5.

Ch. LXXVIII.—IT. Vatum. Used here in its primary sense:

prophets, diviners. The secondary and more frequent sense is: sacred

poets, bards.—18. Intactus, sc. Vespasian.

19. Rerum domimis, i. e.' emperor.—Mathematicum. Cf. note,

1,22.

22. Repente. Suet. (Vesp. 5) says: sine ulla vi. Xiph. (66, 1),

on the contrary, says, it was by a violent wind. " Tam parum sibi
