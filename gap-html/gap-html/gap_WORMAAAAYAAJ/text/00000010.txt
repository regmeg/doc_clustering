PREFACE.

With these explanations, the editor takes leave of a work,

on which he has bestowed much time and toil, and which, he

would fain hope, may contribute in some humble measure to

the better understanding and appreciation by his youthful

countrymen of an author, a language and a people, formed

by nature beyond most, if not beyond all others, to be sever­

ally the writer, the vehicle and the subject of history.

AmhEe-st, 1818.

PREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION.

IN this Kevised Edition, the text and the notes have been

carefully collated with those of Ritter in his new edition (Bonn

and Cambridge, 1848), and such corrections and additions, as

were deemed just and important, have been adopted from this

source. I cannot, however, by any means, accept the many

gratuitous emendations and dogmatic assertions which disfig­

ure and depreciate this otherwise excellent commentary. Other

corrections and improvements have also been made, which

have been suggested by use of the book in classes, or to which

my attention has been called, whether by private correspond­

ence, or by notices and reviews in the public journals. I have

been especially indebted to the critical acumen and accurate

scholarship of my friend, Mr. Charles Short, of Roxbury, wri­

ting in the Bibliotheca Sacra, for not a few valuable sugges«

tions and amendments.

AmhEbst, JuLt, 1881.
