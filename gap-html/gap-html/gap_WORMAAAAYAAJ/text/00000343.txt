Book ii. 339

Ch. LVIII.—2T. Utramque Mauretaniam. Cf. duae Maure-JQJ

taniae, 1, 11. Uterque is plural in its meaning, but seldom used in a

plural form, when only two persons or things are spoken of.

31. Decem novem. For decem el novem. Al. undeviginti (Wr.),

and uovendecim (Oberlin and the common editions). But neither of

these is found in the MSS. Zumpt says (115, N. 2), that such forms

as octodedm and novendeeim are not supported by any authority.

34. Hispaniae. Spain had espoused the cause of Vitellius.

2. Jubae nomeii. Quod erat illustre inter Maurorum reges. Brot.JQ2

Ch. LIX.—T. Appulsu littoris. Immediately on his approach

to the shore. AI. appulsus.

9. Quae fierent. Which might (chance) to be done, i. e. what­

ever they might be.

1 2. Arare. Now the Saone. Cf. Ann. 13, 53.—Paratu = ap-

paratu. Dod.—Vetere egeslate. For the extreme poverty of Vitellius

at his setting out for the province, from which he returned an emperor,

cf. Suet. Vitei. 7.

14. Par opibus. With resources equal to his liberality.

16. Ingratus, sc. because he outshone Vitellius—a crime which

he finally expiated with his blood. Cf. 3, 39.—Quamvis. Although,

followed by the subj. Cf. Gr. 263, 2 ; Z. 574 ; and note below, 79:

quamvis .... jurasset.

19. Curuli, sc. sellae. Chair of state, occupied originally only

by the kings (Liv. 1, 20: curuli regia sella) ; under the republic by

all the principal magistrates ; under the emperors again more restricted,

viz. to themselves, the Augustales and the praetor in the administration

of justice. Cf. Smith's Diet, of Antiq., Sella.

20. Infanti filio. Qui titubantia oris prope mutus fuit. Cf. Suet

.

Vitel. 6. Brotier.—Pcrlatum. Brought to him.

23. Rebus .... cessit. It was some solace that the child had

once worn princely robes. So when Vitellius was insulted by a tribune

and expected every moment to be put to death, he said; " but yet I

have been your sovereign" (3, 85). The passage has been made the

subject of much needless censure by the commentators-—Rebus ad-

versis. The son, as well as the father, was ere long put to death.

Cf. 4, 80.

Ch. LX.—26. Contactu. Under their influence, spreading from

one to another like a contagious disease.

33. Fidem absolvit. Pardoned their fidelity to Otho, as if a

crime. Cf. 1, 59: fidei crimine, gravissimo inter desciscentes. Observe

the satire on Vitellius, who is represented as pardoning v,rtue and re­

warding crime. , v

36. Creditum fama. It was believed on the ground of mere

rumor.
