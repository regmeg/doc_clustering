418 NOTES.

1' Super fortunam. Non raodo par, red etiam superior fortuni

Imperatoria. Rup. Cf. 2,1: quantaecunque fortunae capax.

S. Decorum. Elegant in person and manners. Cf. 2,1: decor

oris cum quadam majestate, said of Titus. Wr. takes it in the more

general sense of propriety of conduct, Ritter connects it with in armis.

215 1« Comitate et alloquiis = affability of address, by hendiadys-

2. In opere. In the labor of the camp. Cf. 3,10: valli opus.

—In agmine. In the fatigue of the march.- -Incorrupto .. . honore.

Without impairing the dignity of a commander.

T« Agrippa, etc. For these kings, cf. notes, 2, 81.

9. Multi is the subject of comitabantur.

10. Occupaiidi .... vacuum. These words are exactly correl­

ative in signification : the hope of gaining a prior hold on the favor

of a prince whoso affections were not yet preoccupied.

Ch. II.—16. Creta lusula. We find mentioned (1 Sam. 30,14,

Ezek. 25, 16, Zeph. 2, 5) a nation, in the south of Palestine, called

Crethim (Cherethites in the English version, in the Septuagint, Kp,jrof,

Cretans), who were probably connected with the inhabitants of Crete,

and who wero perhaps confounded with their Jowish neighbors by the

authorities from which Tacitus drew. The supposition of a Cretan

origin of the Jews may also have been confirmed by a similarity of

customs between the two nations, e. g. abstaining from swine's flesh.—

Novissima. Remotest.

17. Q,ua tempestate. Poetical for quo tempore. Cicero declares,

however (De Or. 3, 38), that he should not hesitate to use the expres­

sion in prose.—Saturnus . . . pulsus. For the dethroning and banish­

ment of Saturn by his son Jupiter, see Die. Myth, and Biog., Satur­

nus; Man. P. 2, 15, etc. Ad verbum pulsus, cf. note, 1, 20.

20. Regnaute Iside. Cf. Die. Myth, and Biog.; also Man. P.

2, 96. 2.—Exundantem. Lit. overflowing, to which answers exone-

ratam, discharged; the figure being drawn from a stream. Exun-

dare is a post-Augustan word.

24. Tradant. Al. tradunt. Cf. Gr. 264, 6 ; Z. 561.—Assyrios,

etc. The tyro at the present day hardly need be informed, that this

is the only tradition which accords at all with the facts, though there

are circumstances giving plausibility to some of the others here re­

corded by T.

25. Proprias urbes. Cities of their own, ant . to parte Aegypti

potitos ; or cities previously their own in Canaan. Gon. 1,31.

26. Proplora Syriae. The adjacent parts of Syria. Cf. 16,

infra: propiora ftuminis.

27. Clara is taken by Wr. and Rup. in the sense of clear, mani­

fest, implying that this is the true origin. Others take it in the sense

of illustrious.—Initia is in appos. with Solymos.—Carminibus Ho-

meri. Il. 6, 184. 204 ; Odys. 5, 283.
