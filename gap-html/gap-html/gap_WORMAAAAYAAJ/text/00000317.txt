upon the passions and the prejudices of the soldiers with much of ther

same skill as that recorded in 37-8. '

Ch. LXXXV.—12. Et oratio. Et is correlative to et before se-

veritatis. Both his address and his moderation were well received.

Observe accepta nom. pi. neuter agreeing with two subs., one masc ,

the other fem.

16. Strepitus militibus. Such is the reading of the best

MSS. Al. strepitus telorum et fades belli erat militibus, which is

adopted in the common editions with a colon after erat. Various oth­

er emendations have been suggested. But it may be read as it is,

and the conciseness and enallage of the text go to substantiate its gen­

uineness. Strepitus .... belli is one reason for non quies redierat ;

et militibus, etc., is another. The former is expressed in the nom.,

the latter is thiPl-egular abl. of cause.

18. Occulto habitu, i. e. in the guise of citizens or countrymen,

and acting the part of spies.—Maligna cura. Evil intentions. Dod.

refers occulto habitu also to the concealment of their feelings, animi

being understood by prcegnantia. Cf. Essay, p. 16.

23. In publico. Ant. to secreta domuum.

24. Attulisset. Subj. Cf. Gr. 264, 12 ; Z. 569.—Conversis.

Al. conversi. But conversis is found in the Medicean and nearly all

the other MSS. It is abl. of cause or manner with hominibus under­

stood: But there was the greatest agitation in public, when (or since)

men changed (lit. men being changed as to) their feelings and coun­

tenances with every report which rumor brought, sc. from Vitellius.

20. Modus. The juste milieu, happy mean. What follows is

thus paraphrased by Lipsius: Taceres? silentium pro contumacia

esset. Diceres libere? iuvisa - libertas. Ad gratiam loquerere? non

faceres fidem, quia privatus nuper Otho peritus harum rerum et iisdem

adulationibus exercitus.

27. Ne for the more common but less concise ut non. Cf. Essay,

p. 10.

29. Sententias. Their opinions given in the senate-house.

Ch. LXXXVL—34. Auctoribus. For ab auctoribus. Cf. Gr.

225, 11.

35. Omissas, i. e. dropped from the hands of the goddess, as if she

were unable to hold them. Cf. Plut. Oth. 4. See also, touching these

prodigies, Suet. Oth. 8 ; and Xiph. 64, 7.

36. Cella. Primarily a storeroom (from celo). Secondarily the

interior of a temple. In the Capitoline temple there were three dis­

tinct cellae under the same roof, with common partition-walls, viz.

that of Jupiter in the centre, that of Minerva on the right, and that of

Juno on the left. Render: chapel of Juno.

38. Imnioto. Undisturbed by earthquake, or storm, or any natu­

ral cause of such a phenomenon. Cf. Pint, in loc. cit,^-/n Orientem,
