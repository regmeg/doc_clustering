Book ii. 343

P«f[i

21. Principium .... fatis. The foreign war was with the Ba-JQg

tavians under Civilis (Books 4 and 5, passim): the domestic with Ves­

pasian.

23. Inanla belli. The empty parade of war. Ad rem, cf. 1, 61.

Ad verba, cf. A. 6: inanid honoris, etc.

25. Amputari .... numeros. The companies to he cut down,

i. e. so as to reduce the number of soldiers without diminishing the

number of cohorts.

30. Apud .... stetit. In whose day the republic was in a bet­

ter condition, and that not because there was more money, but be­

cause there was more virtue. Two sentences in one. Cf. Essay, p. 18.

Cu. LXX.—32. Miuiere = spectaculo gladiatorum (cf. 67); called

munus, as a present to the people. Ramshorn, 944.

35. Intra .... diem. Within forty days after the battle; of

course, before the bodies had gone wholly to decay—putrid, but still

wearing the human form.

36. Formae. The general forins. The minute and distinguish­

ing features were lost.

37. Tabo. This form (viz. after the 2d declension) is found only

in poetry and post-Augustan prose. Cf. Freund.

38. Inhumana. Shocking to humanity. Cf. 3, 83: inhumana

securitas. The Postumian way, now strewed with roses and laurels

and lined with altars smoking with victims, as if in honor of some

despotic prince, had been obstructed with heaps of slain in the disas­

trous flight to Bedriacum (cf. 44), and must have been still thickly

strewn with their putrid corses. The contrast was truly monstrous.

2. Quae fecere. Cf. 3, 18, seq., and 3, 27-34. JQ7

8. Clamore et gaudio. Shouts of joy. So lacrimae et miseri-

cordia = tears of compassion, by hendiadys. Foedum et atrox, just

above, is still another instance of the fondness of Tac. for such pairs.

Cf. note, 1, 84: domibus, etc.

10. Et erant. There were also.—Varia fors rerum. The vi­

cissitudes of life.

11. Subiret. Cf. note, 1, 13: subisse. A more simple writer

would have said : affected even to tears, making fors only the subject

of subiret. For the subj. cf. Gr. 264, 6; Z. 561.—Flexit. Cf. note,

46: flexerat. Observe the emphatic separation of non from the verb,

to mark the contrast between Vitellius and others.

12. Tot mlllia. Cf. note, 44: strage corporum.—Laetus ultra.

Nay, he was joyful even. Cf. note, 65 : puniri ultro. Suetonius re­

ports a remark almost too monstrous to be imputed even to Vitellius,

aud too vile and vulgar to be recorded by Tacitus: optime olere occi-

sum hostem, et melius civem. Cf. Vitel. 10, where, as also in Xiph.

65, 1, see further of this visit to the field of battle.

Cu. LXXI.—IT. Iter, sc. Vitellii ad Romam.
