Book n. 835

ff

30. Extremis. My last hours, my death. Lipsius ccmparesg,jr

the sentiments of this speech with those of Ajax when about to ter­

minate his life. Soph. Aj. 852, seq.

Ch. XLVIII.—35. Irent. Cf. note, 1, 41: agerent.

36. Asperarent for exasperarent, simple for compound. Scarcely

found in this sense in any other prose writer.

38. Naves. Otho was at Brixellum, i. e. at the confluence of

the Po and the Nicia.

2. Nee ut periturus. Nor yet with the profusion of a man 98

quitting the world. Murphy.

3. Fratris filium, sc. of Salvius Titianus, who had fled to the

camp, according to T. (44); Suetonius makes him to have been

present on this occasion (Oth. 10), and his son to have been slain

(Dom. 10). Plutarch agrees with T. (Oth. 10).

11. Jullos, sc. Augustus, Tiberius and Caligula.—Claudios, sc.

Nero and Claudius.—Servios, sc. Galba. . .

12. Familiam = gentem, sc. Salviam. Rup.

13. Capesseret = frueretur.—Neu meminisset. Trans­

lated by Plut. Oth. 16. Cf. note on adeo imperite above, 39.

Ch. XLIX.—15. Dimotis, i. e. jussis abire.

17. Avertit, sc. ab his curis.

19. Verginium. Cf. 1, 8. 9. Brotier suggests, that the exam­

ple of Verginius in declining the imperial dignity, may have been

regarded by the soldiers as a cause of Otho's undervaluing and re­

signing it.

22. Allatis pugionibus. After the example of Nero. Cf. Suet

.

Ner. 49. Some MSS. and most editions add duobus. But it is not in

the best MSS. and is quite superfluous. Cf. Or. in loc.

23. Cum .... perteutasset. When he had carefully (per)

tried the points of both—for some time, adds Plutarch (Oth. 17):

ffoAfie %p6vov.

27. Unumvuinus. Indicative of intrepidity in the act of suicide.

28. Ambitiosis. Earnest, like those of the candidate soliciting

popular favor. Nero had made the same request (Suet. Ner. 49).

Alike in their manner of life, in death they were not dissimilar, though

Otho died with the greater dignity.

31. lixosculantes. Ex giies emphasis: kissing fondly, re­

peatedly. This compound is not found earlier than the age of T.

32. Noil noxa neque ob mctum. Hendiadys according to

Wr. But Oberlin and Rup. refer noxa to Otho, and metum to Vitel-

lius as its object: not through remorse for any unfaithfulness to Otho,

nor through fear of punishment from Vitellius. And so it is expressly

rendered by Plutarch (Oth. 17).

34. Celebratum. Saepe et a multis peractum. Rup. Cf. note,

1, 81: celebre.
