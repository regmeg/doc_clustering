BOOK V. 421

?**

For the manner in which the animal was selected, served and wor- 2j(J

shipped, cf. Diet, of Mythol. and Biog. sub voce.—Merito = culpa

and causa. Dbd. and Or. Al. memoria.

16. Qua.... turpaverat. T. probably hits here upon a true

reason, though not the only one, for the prohibition of swine's flesh to

the Israelites. The eating of it exposes to the leprosy, that dreadful

scourge of the East. The Levitical law was founded more in reason

and the nature of things than is generally supposed.

17. I,Ongam olim famem. Cf. 3. Olim here = an adj,

former.

1 8. Raptarum .... detinetur. As a proof of their seizure of

grain (to relieve their hunger), Jewish bread is carefully kept with­

out leaven. This is true only of the bread used at the feast of the

Passover. As to the thing signified by the unleavened bread, T. ap­

proximates the truth. Cf. Ex. 12, 15, seq.; Deut . 16, 3. Al. retine-

tur. Cf. Ann. 6, 23: detinuisset. Detinetur denotes care and effort.

20. Quia .... tulerit. Cf. close of previous section. Laborum

refers to their fatiguing journey.

24. De septem sideribus. Of the seven planets. Al. e. But

de has the better authority and is often used for e or ex. Cf. Cic. pro

Flac.: quis de nostris hominibus.—Quis .... reguntur. A doc­

trine taught by ancient philosophers, as also by modern astrologers.—

Altissimo orbe feratur. Revolves in the highest orbit. So the Gr.

,pipoimt is used in the sense of revolve. The day of the Jewish sabbath

was sacred to Saturn among the Greeks and Romans, and is even

now called Saturday.

26. "Vim .... confidant. Exert their influence and perform

their revolutions by the number seven. Some recondite astrological

notion is concealed here. The number seven was a sacred number

with the Jews, as also with many other nations. The principal MSS.

instead of confidant read commearent, which Wr. retains and consid­

ers to be used like the Greek optative.

Ch. V.—30. Pessimus . .. gerebant. This refers to those Jews

and proselytes who dwelt in foreign lands; for, though dispersed over

the world, the Jews still retained their nationality, and annually sent

contributions (tributa et stipes) to support the temple worship at Je­

rusalem. Cf. Cic. pro Flac. 28; Joseph. B.J. 6, 6,2. Patriis must

of course refer to their adopted countries.

31. Et quia, etc. Sub. praeterea auctae. Ami their wealth was

still further increased, because among themselves they cherished an

inflexible fidelity and lively (in promptu = an adj.) compassion, but

towards all other nations, hatred as if they were enemies. The pas­

sage is pointed and read differently by different editors. We have

given that of Or. and many others, which 8" ems to make the con­

nection more natural than any other.
