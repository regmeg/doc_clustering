276 NOTES.

TiVactmg the part, by which it is implied, that his friendship for Nero

was a mere pretence. Cf. Ann. 1, 4: specie secessus, exsulem egerit,

said of the false Tiberius.—Habitu imperium. Suetonius (Oth.

12) describes Otho as a man of small stature, ill-set on his feet, with

crooked legs, but of almost feminine neatness. Habitu here means

person, as in 14 and 17, where see notes.

18. IUo denotes notoriety. Gr. 207, R. 24; Z. 701.—Mereretur

est optativus Graecorum = should he gain 1 Wr. Such questions

asked by the subj. imply a negative answer. Cf. Z. 530.

19. Specie. Al . speciem. But compare Plin. Ep. 2, 6: ne tibi

Iuxuria specie frugalitatis imponat.—Imponit. Deceives, or imposes

upon.—Iste denotes contempt . Gr. 207 R. 25; Z. 701, = thai

wretch, or fellow.

22. Sit. May be = though it may be, yet the shame, etc.

26. Vestra. For the case and construction of this word, see Gr.

219, R. 2; also Z. 449.

29. Nero .... destituit. Nero fled from his palace before he

was deserted by his palace-guard. The same cohort was now on duty

30. Minus .... transfugae. For the construction of transfugae,

cf. Gr. 256, R. 6.

33. Commune .... facitis, i. e. become partakers in the-guilt.

34. Ad nos .... pertinebunt. Though the fatal issue of this

criminal rebellion will fall upon us, yet to you will remain the ca­

lamitous consequences of the civil wars that must ensue.

31. Perinde. Al. proinde. But proinde, therefore, has no force;

and though it rests on rather better MS. authority, yet the two words

are perpetually confounded in the MSS. Perinde is correl. to quam

= as much as.—Donativum. Al. donativo plus, for which reading

it is argued, that Piso must offer more than Otho, or the offer would

be manifestly unavailing. So Wr. and Rup. But Bach replies with

great truth and force, that a mind like Piso's could not conceive that

the soldiers would not prefer a reward pro fide to an equal reward pro

Jacinore. Dod. and Or. read donativom. This entire speech is ad­

mirably suited to the character of Piso, as the speech of Galba is to

his. Review the character of Piso, as briefly sketched in 14 and 15,

and acted out in 17. Then look at the calm dignity, the modesty and

yet the conscious worth, the scorn of vice and the contempt for all the

low arts of gaining favor with the rabble, which pervade this speech,

and you cannot but discern and admire its fitness.

45 Ch. XXXI.—1. Dilapsis. Having stolen away, one by one.

They were, bribed by Otho. Cf. 27.—Cetera. The rest, sc. praeter

spcculatores.

2. Concionantem. The speaker, sc. Piso. Concio = 1. An as­

sembly. 2. An address boforo it.—Ut.... evenit is to be taken with

forte et nulla .... consilio—it is common in times of commotion for
