Iiarity of T. (cf. insulam inter, 4, 19; Z. 324); though the best proseJJQ

writers frequently place the prep, between the adj. and subs. Cf. note,

2, 37: magna ex parte.—Carmelug. A mountain in Galilee on the

Mediterranean. Two others in Palestine bore the same name, which

properly denotes a garden-like fertility and beauty. Cf. Isaiah, 35, 2:

" the excellency of Carmel."

29. Deumque, sc. cujus oraculum in monte fuit . Cf. Suet. Vesp.

5 ; Oros. 7, 9. Or. thinks it was the old Philistine god of war.

30. Sic tradidere, etc. Al. situm tradidere, etc., by conjecture.

The passage, as it stands in the text and in the MSS., is elliptical and

concise = sic tradidere majores, i. e. tradidere aram tantum, etc. Wr.

34. Ampllare servitia = augere numerum servitiorum. Rup.

Ampliare and prolatare are both used here in a sense peculiar to poe­

try, or to the age of T.

35. Has ambages. These obscure prophetic intimations. Cf.

4: per ambages. Cf. Suet. Vesp. 5. 7, for a fuller and somewhat dif­

ferent account of these and other oracles and prodigies.

36. Et statim . . . et tune. Cf. note, 1, 17: statim .. . et max.

Ch. LXXIX.—1. Haud .... desttnatione, i. o. with a settled]^]

plan or purpose.

2. Antiochlam, Caesaream. Places familiar to us in sacred,

even moro than in profane history. Cf. Acts, passim—Ilia, the for­

mer ; haec, the latter. Dod. follows the Mediceau MS. in reading

hoc, agreeing with caput.

3. Initium .... coeptum. Cf. note, G. 30 : initium inchoare.

Wr. says: coepisse Tacito est imxttpi,v. See Essay, p. 20.—Ferendu

Ernesti prefers deferendi. But cf. note, 1, 2 : missa.

T. Quinto Nonas Julias = July 3d. Suet. (Vesp. 6) says:

quiuto idus Jul. T. is proved to be correct.—Jurasset. Subj. after

quamvis, as usual in T. and Cic, though most of the later writers

construe quamvis with the ind.

lO. N on parata concione. Without any formal harangue;

such as it was usual for new aspirants or nominees to the throne to

make, e. g. Otho, 1, 36; Galba, Suet. Galb. 18; and others.

Ch. LXXX.—13. Prima vox. The first salutation or nomina­

tion.—Spes .. . casus. Observo the asyndeton and the antith. pairs:

hope, fear; principle, chance, i. e. the principles to be adopted and

.he chances to be met.

15. Assistentes, sc. cubiculo; the guards of the bedchamber.

16. Caesarem .... cumulare. Observo the zeugma. Cf Es­

say, p. 16.

IT. Mens. Cujus mens? Vespasiani. Ernesti. Amicorum Ves-

pasiani. Wr. and Or. Militum ceterorum praeter illos, qui salutavere.

Rup. Ruporti is right; for ceteri doubtless refers to the soldiers; and

the transition from them to Vespasian himself is marked by in ipso.
