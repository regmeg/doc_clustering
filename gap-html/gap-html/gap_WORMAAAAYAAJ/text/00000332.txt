NOTES.

j 1T. Adverso rumore. Ant. to probata: generally condemned

Ch. XXVII.—19. Apud Caecinam, i. e. iu the army of Caecina.

Obterve the omission of sed before Fabii. Cf. Essay, p. 13. It ia

inserted in many editions.

22. Tlcinum. On the river Ticinus, near its confluence with the

Po. Now Pavia in Milan.

24. Alioquin. Literally, in other respects, i. e. but, besides.—

Altiore initio = altius et ab initio. Dod. Cf. Essay, p. 18.

29. Retulimus. Cf. 1, 59.—Ut.... accessissent. Subj. Cf

Gr. 264, 12; Z. 569.

33. Jurgiis .... rixis. Cf. note on these words, 1, 64.

34. Ad postremum, etc. At last, Valens was suspicious

that out of this quarrelsome spirit would grow something worse

even open mutiny. Suspectare is not found in writers of the age o!

Augustus. Cf. Freund, sub voce.

Ch. XXVIII.—36. Puisam clrcumlri. Ad rem, cf.

14, seq.

7. Sanitas. Completeness.—Sustentaculum. Prop. It is a new

word, invented so far as appears by T.—Columen. Allied to coluni'

na, culmen, and our word column = stay, support.

8. Iu .... verteretur. Lit. turns in (we say on) Italy, i. e. the

whole question is to be decided there. Verteretur is appropriate to

sustentaculum and columen, but not to sanitas, which properly means

health. Dod. takes columen in the senso of summit, and says: sani-

tas ad plenitatem, sustentaculum ad stabilitatem, columen ad gloriam

victoriae spectat.

Ch. XXIX.—14. SarciniSjSc. Valentis. The word properly de­

notes a pack (from sarcio, to sew) ; hence private baggage, camp-

equipage.

P. 3, 290.

IT. Praefectus castrorum. Cf. note, 26.—Deflagrante, Sub­

siding, lit. burning out.—Addit consilium, i. e. adopts a plan for quel­

ling it still further. This plan is expressed by the ablatives which

follow: vetitis, &c, instead oivetuit enim, &c, which would be less

concise. W

18. Obire vigilias. To visit the watch, go the rounds of inspec­

tion. Cf. note, 1,48 ; also Fiske's Man. P. 3, 298.—Omisso . . . sono.

Nam tuba initio, cornu seu buccina in fine vigiliarum cani solebat

.

Veget. 3,8; Polyb. 6, 37. Rup.

28. Plus .... llcere. Guilt, when widely spread, levels all dia-

tinctions. Lucan truly observes (Pharsal. 5, 290): Facinus, quos in.

quinat, aequat. Murphy.

Ch XXX—32. Nolle requiem. Observe the series of infini­

tives, indicative of rapidity. Cf. note, 1, 36: complccti armis, etc
