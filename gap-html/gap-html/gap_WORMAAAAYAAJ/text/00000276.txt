NOTES.

j would therofore naturally suspect of cherishing resentment toward*

himself for putting to death their benefactor. Cf. 6.

26. Vulgus. Antithetic to primores militum; henco common

soldiers.

2T. Q,uos .... acccnderct. Subj. in a relative clause after an

indefinite general expression.

28. Mutandae militiae. A change of military service, i. e. a

transfer from tho praetorian guards to some less desirable service. The

metus here is the exact opposite of the spes honoratioris in posterum

militiae, 87 ; and is well explained by the language of Suetonius on

the same subject. Galb. 16.

Ch. XXVI.—30. Tabes. The spreading spirit of revolt is here

likened to a toasting and contagious disease.—Quoque. Also, i. e.

of the legions, &c, as well as the praetorians.

33. Integros. Antithetic to malos = the good, lit. entire. So

our word holy from whole.—Dissimulatio. Concealment, neutrality.

Well explained by paterentur in 28. It will be observed that parata

must be taken in a little different sense with dissimulatio and with

seditio, since the latter had been got ready, while the former was

found ready, opportunely existing. Cf. Essay on the Style of Taci­

tus, p. 16.—Postero iduum dierum. The day after the Ides days,

bc. of Jan., i. e. Jan. 14. (Gr. 326.) The expression is singular. It

seems to be like the Greek vrripq tilUv. There can scarcely be a

doubt as to the day meant. Cf. 27, where the author proceeds to the

events of Jan. 15. Al. die, a conjectural amendment. Dierum is

found in tho Medicean and all the best MSS., but is included in brack­

ets by Or., and entirely omitted by Dod.

34. Rapturi fuerint. They would have carried him off, sc. to

the pratorian camp, to make him emperor. Observe the use of the

periphrastic form to denote intention. For the subj. perf., cf. note on

chap. 24: dederit.—Incerta and castra are both objects of timuis-

sent.

36. Cura is abl., denoting the cause why they did not proceed im­

mediately to action.

38. Ut quisque ... oblatus esset. Any one, who-might chance

to have fallen in with the soldiers of the Pannonian or the German

army. The plup. is used, because the action expressed by oblatus esset

is prior to that expressed by destinaretur. Tho subjunctive denotes

contingency : might perchance have fallen in.

1. Ignorantibus plerisque. Since most of them were not ac­

quainted with Otho. Abl. of cause limiting destinaretur.—Desiina-

retur = designaretur salutareturque princeps. Rup.

3. Apud .... aures. In the hearing of Galba.

1. Elusit. Made sport of.—Consilii. Governed by inimicus,

which is connected by que to ignarus.
