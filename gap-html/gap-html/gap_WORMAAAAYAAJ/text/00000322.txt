318 NOTES.

Tut

rjrj T. Audentioribus spatiis. With holder courses. With this po«

etical use of spatiis compare Cicero's use of it for turns or courses in

walking. Cic. de Or. 1, 7, 28. Antith. to praevectus .... oranu

Previous to the invention of the compass, sailors feared to lose sight of

the shore. Titus was daring because he was impatient.

8. Templum .... inciitum. Cf. Strabo, 14; and Herod. 1,105.

also Virg. Aen. I, 415. There was also in the island another less fa­

mous temple of Venus, who took the epithet Cyprian from the extent

of her worship by the pleasure-loving Cyprians.—Paphiae Veneris.

Paphos, in the isle of Cyprus, was sacred to the worship of Venus.

9. Haud fuerit. It will not be, etc. Cf. note, 83: neque cre-

diderim; and 84: depoposcerint.

10. Templi ritum. AK situm, but the site of the temple T.

does not describe. On the word templum, cf. notes, 1, 27; and G. 9:

cohibere parietibus.

11. Hahetur, sc. religio, templi ritus et forma deae. Murphy

avails himself of this digression to vindicate T. from the charge of irre-

ligion.

Ch. III.—14. A Cinyra. De Cinyra, vid. Athenaeus, 1, 10

Aelian, G. 36. Rup.

15. Conceptam mari. Sprung from the (foam of the) sea,

hence her name 'A^poJfc-,j.—Appulsam. Wafted.

16. Harusplcum. Cf. note, 1, 27.—Accitam. Introduced from

abroad.—17. Familiae utriusque, i. e. of Cinyras and Thamiras.

2t>. Cinyrades. The. descendant of Cinyras.—Hostiae. Slaln

was prohibited. Cf. the use made of the compluribus hostiis slain by

Titus, 4.

22. Haedorum, animalium libidinosorum. Rup.—Fibris. En­

trails. Virg. Aen. 10, 176. He avoids the usual word exta.

23. Adolentur. Adolere proprie est olentem reddere cremando,

et hinc cremare. Bach. It is also used poetically in the sense to load

with offerings. The sentence does not bear a literal translation into

English. Render: Supplications and a pure flame of fire are the

only offerings on the attar. The distinction between ara and altars

(for which see Lexicon) is not here observed.—Nec ullis imbribus, etc

Pliny makes the same statement, N. H. 2, 96.

25. Continuus orbis, etc. Stripped of its verbiage (cf. note on

description of Britain, A. 10), this description imports simply : in the

shape of a rude cone. Max. Tyr. (8, 7) likens it to a white pyramid.

On the position of in, cf. Z. 324. Continuus, uninterrupted by arms,

neck, head, etc., like most idols.

26. Ratio In obscuro. Probably there was no reason for it, but

the rudeness of the early times in which it originated. Eruesti.
