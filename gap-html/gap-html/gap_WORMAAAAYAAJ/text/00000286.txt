282 NOTES. A

faga

^rj 4. Tanquam ill.... plebe, i. e. the formal and heartless adula«

tion of the multitude (cf. 32) was discordant (variis) and spiritless

(segni = se-igni) iu comparison with the unanimous and impassioned

leal of the soldiers, which expressed itself not more in words than in

actions. Dod. supplies, with this clause, adulobantur from the noun

adulatione by brachylogy. Cf. Essay, p. 15.

6. Affluentium = pouring in. Cf. A. 29 : affluebat.

T. Complecti armis denotes a military embrace with shield and

sword in hand, armis being = armatis brachiis. Cf. Virg. Aen. 12,

433.—Juxta, sc. Othonem.—Praeire sacramentum. Administer the

oath, lit. go over it before them, as they pour in successively. The

officer pronounced the words of the military oath, and lie soldier re­

peated the words after him. Hence the former was said praeire sa­

cramentum, and the latter jurare in verba ejus. In a regular ad­

ministration of the oath, only one of the soldiers repeated the words,

and the others swore to the same that he had done before them. In

the present instance, the soldiers expressed their zeal by volunteering

to administer it to each other. Observe the asyndeton and the series

of infinitives, indicative of rapidity. Cf. note, A. 37: grande ....

spectaculum.

9. Protendens manus. Properly the attitude of supplication,

here of respect and reverence.—Vulgum. Al. vulgus, one MS. The

rest vulgum, which T. probably used after the example of Virgil. So

Wr. and Or.—Jacere oscula. Throw kisses, i. e. kiss his hand with

an accompanying motion of the hand towards him for whom the kiss

was intended. The expression is poetical.

10. Et omnia, sc. facere. Cf. Essay on the Style of T., p. 14.

13. Provallo. Cf. pio gradibus, 29, note.

Ch. XXXVII.—14. Q,uis processerim. In what character

I appear before you, lit. may have appeared. Subj. to soften the ex­

pression. Cf. Gr. 260, R. 4; Z. 527.

IT. Vestrum .... nonicn. Your title also, as well as mine:

for if I am emperor, you are loyal soldiers; if I am an enemy, you aro

rebels. An exordium fit for the prince of demagogues: and so is the

whole speech.—Donee dubitabitur. Cf. note, 35, supra.

18. Habeatis. Subj. Cf. Gr. 265; Z. 552.

19. Auditisne. Do you not hear, sc. from the forum, in the dis-

sono clamore caedem Othonis poscentium, chap. 32, which could be

heard in the preetorian camp, though situated without the walls of the

city. So in chap. 39, we read, vice versa, of cries reaching the city

from the camp. Vid. Or. in loc.—Poena is properly a pecuniary pen­

alty (Gr. Ttowfi), supplicium, capital punishment (sub and plico, bend­

ing under the axe of the executioner). The words are well chosen

and well applied here; Otho means to imply, with the falsehood as

well as the tact of a demagogue, that a severer punishment awaiU
