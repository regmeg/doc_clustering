316 NOTES.

y2 US' Pacis .... reipuhlicae. Pads is objective, and reipuhlicae

subjective gen. after advcrsa (cf. proditionis ira militum, 3, 10):

those evils which the republic experiences in time of peace, i. e. popular

commotions and imperial cruelty. Reipublicae cannot be dat. after

pertinuere, which always takes ad or in with the acc. after it. Hence

some read in rempublicam ; others expunge reipublicae, though found

in all the MSS. Pertimuere is found instead of pertinuere in several

MSS., but not the best. Pertinuere = duravere according to Wr.

But why not take it in the more usual sense of reached, belonged to,

or affected, sc. the people ? Tacitus' use of pertinere may be seen in

3, 19: Expugnatae urbis praedam ad militem, deditae ad duces, per­

tinere. Dod. makes reipublicae dat. (for acc. with ad) after perti­

nuere.

13 ; Dio. 60, 15.

32. Nondum .... ancilium. The sacred shields, made in im­

itation of the golden ones sent down from heaven to Numa by the

nymph Egeria. At different times, during the month of March, these

were borne through the streets by the Salii, and finally laid up (con-

ditorum) in the curia of the Salii, on the Palatine mount . The days

set apart for this ceremony were sacred, and no public business might

be transacted. Cf. Ovid, Fast . 3, 260, seq.; Plut. Numa, etc.

Ch. XC—37. Reliquias sectionum. Cf. 20.

"73 Van sterili. Al. sterile. Parum interest; sed maneat veteri-

bus Iibris sua auctoritas. Wr. Sterili usu is abl. of quality after do-

nunu Cf. sterilis pax, Ann. 1, 17. ,

6. Ipsius. His own.—Scriplor orationis, sc. Galerius Trachalus,

who was an orator and joint consul with Silius Ital. a. v. c. 821. Cf

gulis, nulla dignitatis uc decoris.
