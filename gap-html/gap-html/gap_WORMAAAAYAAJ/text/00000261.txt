man to the supreme power, is doubtless one of the fortuiti eventus of gfj

which T. speaks in chap. 4.

2. Irarum, sc. in Galbam.

4. Hostem pottos, sc. quam cives.

5. Excitae. Called out, raised. The same troops that are spo­

ken of in § 6.

O. Xjegationibus adissent. Cf. legationibus coeunt, G. 39,

note. The purpose of the embassy has been sufficiently intimated in

8: delatum ej imperium, etc. For the subj. after quanquam, c£

note, 5, 21.

Ch. X.—11. Obtinebat. Cf. A. 39, note on samo word.—Liciniut

Mucianus. Cf. Suet. Vesp. G, 13. See his character more fully, 2, 5.

A prominent man in all the subsequent history, especially under

Vespasian.

12. Famosus. In this sense scarcely used, except by poets, be­

fore Tacitus. Cf. Boetticher's Lex. Tac.—Juvenis, when young,

antith. to mox.

14. Repositus. Wr. renders retiring, as if it were voluntary.

But that hardly suits the meaning of the word. Lit. put back, laid

aside, and henco buried, which significations exactly suit the adjuncts

in secretum: buried in an obscure portion of Asia. So Ritter, Ru-

perti and Orelli.—Prope ab. A peculiar Latin idiom. Cf. Cic. Ver.

2, 52 : tam prope a sicilia.

15. Postea a principe. The allusion is to the almost imperial

power of Mucianus under Vesp. Cf. A. 7, note, and places there cited.

—Luxuria .... mixtus — in eo mixtae eraut Iuxuria, etc. Cf. A. 4:

locum mixtum.

IT. Vacaret. Subj. after cum denoting cause, as well as time.—

Expedierat = in expeditionem sive ad bellum profectus erat. Ernesti.

Only T. uses the word thus without an object. It properly means, to

clear the way, prepare, &c. See the fuller construction, 2, 99: ex-

pedire ad hellum.

- 18. I,audares. Al. laudes. But laudares has the better au­  
thority and makes a better construction. You (any one, men) would

praise his public life (palam acta); so crederes, 45; timeres, A. 22,

&c. Gr. 209, R. 7; Z. 528, N. 2.

19. Collegas. Governors of neighboring provinces. The word

means chosen together; hence oither those chosen at the same elec­

tion, or those chosen to the same office.

20. Cui = is, cui or talis, ut ei, a man of such a character, that,

etc. Hence followed by the subj. The reference here is to the prom­

inent part which Mucianus acted in conferring the supreme power on

Vesp. Cf. 2, 76.

21. Flavins Vespasianus. It was the history of Vesp. and his

sons, Titus and Domitian, that T. chiefly intended to write. Hence,
