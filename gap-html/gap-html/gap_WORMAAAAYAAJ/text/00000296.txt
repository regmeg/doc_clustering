38. Ut cul evenisset. Cf. note, 37: ut qui.... trucida-

verit.

I. Expeditionem et aciem. Al. quam otium, which is a con­

jecture of Lipsius. The MSS. and earlier editions have et aciem, and

to this reading, the more recent editors have returned. Render thus:

the army (sc. the German) now preferred campaigns and battles with

their attending rewards (viz. booty and imperial largesses), to the

regular pay and ordinary service. Observe the causative sense of

ditissimi: the source of great wealth. Cf. Tibull.: divitis auri

5. Utrimque. In both parties.

of men in a century varied from 50 to 100, as the legion varied from

3000 to 6000. 'Niebuhr supposes the century to have consisted origin­

ally of thirty footmen, as the turma did of thirty horsemen.—Noverant.

Gauls, they were now eager for another conflict with them.

II. Vocabant, sc. Gallos.

they had given the Gauls this name (Galbians), having become weary

(disgusted) with calling them after Vindex.

14. Scquanis. Dat. after infensi. The Sequani were a people

of Belgic Gaul, and derived their name from the Sequana (Seine)

about the sources of which they dwelt . Their capital was Vesonti*
