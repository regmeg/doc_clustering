888 NOTES.

jg^ 13« Concldit. Cf. Suot. Vitel. 17, where the account is more

full and particular.

Ch. LXXXVI.—15. Patria .... Luceria. The various read­

ings here are many. But this is, with a slight alteration, the reading

of the best two MSS. and accords with Suet. Vitel. 1. Luceria was

an ancient city of Apulia, now Lucera. Cf. Anth. Class. Diet.—Sep-

timum .... annum. So Suet . 18; Eutrop. 7,12 ; Vict. Caes. 10. But

Xiph. (65, 22) says, he lived 54 years and 89 days.

18. Cuncta ... adeptus. Foedis quoque in Caligulam, Claudium

et Neronem obsequiis. Brotier.

23. Continere. Al. contineri. But it is a needless conjecture.

The remark refers to what Vitellius vainly expected to do for himself,

not to what he laid down as a general principle.

24. Meruit.... habult. He earned friends, rather than had

them, as is usually the case with those who seek to buy them.

25. Imputare. Cf. note, 1, 71. Praetendcre non possunt, se

reipublicae causa Vitellium prodldisse. Pichena

BOOK IV.

Jg7 Ch. I.—2. Per urbem. Notice the position of these words. They

do not limit consectabantur, but armati victores: armed victors in

every quarter of the city.

6. Procerum .... juventa. The German soldiers were tall (cf.

G. 4: magna corpora) and youthful; and under pretence of slaying

them, they slew indiscriminately, soldier and citizen, all whom they

could in any way contrive to confound with them.

8, Recentibus odiis. When their hatred was fresh, i. e. in the

heat of battle.—Dein verterat. Had soon after changed. The plup.

denotes the suddenness and completeness of the change. Z. 508.

11. Nee deerat.... prodere. Prodere depends on deerat. In

the common editions it is separated from it by a colon. But deesse

usually takes after it either an inf. or a dat. or a pied. nom. to limit its

meaning. Cf. 3, 58: deerat elicere, 1, 23 : deerat instinctor.

14. Fortunae. The vicissitudes, all the varied fortunes. Com-

" pare the Gr. rtf^m, cv/,^opal. Al. forma and fortuna. Forma is a

mere conjecture.

1T. Turbas et discordias .... pax et quies. Notice the pairs

of synonyms, or rather kindred words. Cf. note, 1, 84.

Ch. II.—20. Sedem. Residence, sc. the imperial palace. At

first he was conducted to the private house of his father. 3, 86.
