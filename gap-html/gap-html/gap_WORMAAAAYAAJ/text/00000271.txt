80 Suet. Galb.: non plus decimis concessis They were allowed t»^Q

keep one-tenth of what they had received, and were required to refund

the remaining nine-tenths.

20. Super .... erant. Separated by tmesis, after the manner

of the poets. So 2, 34: jactis super aucoris. Cf. Virg. Aen. 2, 567:

Jamque adeo super unus eram. They scarcely had remaining the

tenth parts severally (decimae portiones, pl.), still less the nine-tenths.

23. Iiistrumenta vitiorum. Gula, balnea, scorta et alia. Rup.

What a picture of the times!

24r. Exactioni, sc. donationum Neroniarum.—Triginta Suet.

Galb. 15: quinquaginta. Fortasse primum triginta fuere, et numerus

crevit ambitu crescente. Brotier. In numeris libri saepe peccant. Wr.

25. Ambitu .... onerosum. Burdensome (to the state) because

of the number of the commissioners and their extensive powers. So

Wr. and Or. But it accords better with prevailing usage to take am­

bitu in the sense of solicitation, intrigue, which would be greatly in­

creased by the number of commissioners.—Hasta. " It was usual to

»et up a spear in auctions, a symbol derived, it is said, from tho ancient

practice of selling under a spear the booty acquired in war."

26. Sector. " Those are called sectores, who buy property pub-

lice," i. e. sold by public authority. Gaius, 4, 146. Cf. Smith's Diet

.

of Gr. and Rom. Antiq. sub voce.—Actionibus. Actions, i. e. prose­

cutions, against those who refused to repay the sum demanded of

them. So Wr., Rup. and Or., with the Medicean and other best MSS.

Al. auctionibus. But that makes a mere tautology, for what do hasta

and sector denote but auctions ?

27. Q,uod . . . . forent. Subj. = because in their view they

were as poor, etc. Cf. Gr. 266, 3 ; Z. 629.—Donasset. Cf. Gr. 266,

1 ; Z. 547.

28. Exauctorati. Strictly, released from the military oath, dis­

missed. But here, in accordance with the prevailing usage of Tacitus

and the later times of the empire, dismissed in disgrace, cashiered.

29. Praetorio. The praetorium was primarily the headquarters

of the Roman general (Prae-itor): afterwards more especially tho

camp of the praetorian cohorts (imperial guards) at Rome. Here put

for the pratarian guards themselves, which consisted originally of

nine cohorts of a thousand men each (Ann. 4, 5), and subsequently

(under Vitellius) rose to the number of 16 cohorts, or 16,000 men.

His. 2, 93.—Antonius .... Antonius. Instead of this repetition, we

should have had Antonii once before both names, if they had belonged

to the same family. The repetition shows that they belonged to dif­

ferent families.

30. Urbanis cohortibus. Three cohorts, the proprius miles ur-

bis. Ann. 4, 5.—Vigiliis. Put for cohorlibus vigilum, like praetorio

for praetorianis. The vigiliae consisted of seven cohorts, each having
