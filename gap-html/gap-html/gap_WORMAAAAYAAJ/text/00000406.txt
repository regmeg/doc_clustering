innocent, and hence emulously volunteered to take the oath ; while

the rest, some of whom were guilty, waited till called on for their

assent.

1 ft. Probabaut.... arguebant. The senate approved the re­

ligious scruples, but censured the false swearing, for after all the

emphatic word (probabant) first, tho coutrasted words (religionem,

perjurium) near each other.'
