3 NOTES.

3T. Verginius. Verginius Rufus, legate of Upper Germany un

der Nero. See some account of his character and the relation of T

to him in the Life of Tacitus. Also Plin. Ep. 2, 1 ; 5, 3; 6, 10; and

Plut. Galb.—Imperare = esse imperator.

28. Voluisset. Subj. to denote an indirect question. Cf. Gr. 2C5 ;

Z. 552. Plup. to correspond with the imperf., on which it depends,

and which is used in all this account of the state of things prior to the

date of the history.—Dubium, sc. erat: it was a matter of uncertainty

to thE mEn of that day, whether he wished to be emperor. So con-

veniebat: it was agreed by all authorities of that day.

30. Abducto, sc. by Galba, to whom he had been calumniated by

Fabius Valens, 3, 62.

31. Quem .... reum esse. The fact, that he was not sent

back to them and was even called to an account, they construed as

a charge against themselves.

Ch. IX.—33. Superior exercitus. The army of Upper Ger­

many, autith. to Inferioris Germaniae legiones just below. The

. German armies in general were the subject of the latter part of the

previous section. Here the author spedfies the two divisions.—Hor-

deonium Flaccum. Appointed legate of Upper Germany by Galba,

instead of Verginius recalled. His name will occur often in the sub­

sequent history. See also Plut. Galb.

31. Debilitate pedum invalidum. He was afflicted with the

gout . Plut. Galb. 16.

35. Ne .... quidem. Not even.—Quieto milite = quum quieti

essentmilites.—Regimen. Sub. ejus erat = eos regere poterat. Rup.

36. Adeo = much more (lit . in addition to that). Cf. 4, 80:

aequalium quoque, adeo superiorum intolerantis. So adeo non = still

less, 3, 39.

3T. Inferioris Germaniae. It should be understood, that Up­

per and Lower Germany here include no part of that Germany proper

of which T. treats in his de Germania, and which was not conquered

by the Romans; but they are two Roman provinces into which Ger­

mania Cisrhenana was subdivided, both on the left or Gallic bank of

the Rhine, Upper Germany towards its source, Lower Germany to­

wards its mouth (now Belgium). They were peopled by German

tribes.—Consulari. Cf. notes supra, chap. 7: Fonteii Capitonis, and

Legati legionum.

38. A. Vitelllus. Afterwards emperor. He had been consul

(Ann. 11, 23), and of course was now consularis. Of Vitellius the

father, see Ann. 6, 28; 14, 56 ; 12, 4. 5. 42. et al.

35 !• Id satis videbatur, sc. to Galba and his advisers, who thought

that the rank of Vitellius would satisfy the legions, though his gluttony

and effeminacy rendered him quite unfit for such £ charge Cf. Suet

.
