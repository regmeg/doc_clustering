412 NOTES.

2QgIfcrimis ac silentio — silent tears: pudor ac dedecus = the shame

of their disgrace Periculum aut metus. Cf. note, 1,88.

12« Ne .... objectaret. That no one should reproach his fel­

low-soldiers with their revolt or their (subsequent) calamities.

This section, like 58 and 61 supra, showf the high sense of honor

and duty which marked, and in a great measure made the Roman

soldier.

Ch. LXXIII.—16. Neque ego unquam . . . et = ego et nun-

quam ... et. Cf. notes, G. 2 nec ... et, H. 1, 15: neque ipse.

IT. Armis affirmavi. / have demonstrated by arms, not by

words. The address accordingly bespeaks the soldier, rather than the

orator.

20. Profligato bello. Now the war is finished.

22. Nulla cupidine. Is this said of the Romans.' Compare

the speech of Calgacus, A. 30.

25. Q,uot proeliis, etc. On the German wars, cf. G. 37 and

notes ibid.

26. Teutonosque. This word contains the element of the mod­

ern name of the Germans, sc. Deutsche (D is pronounced like T).

For the Teutonic war, cf. Veil. Paterc. 2, 8. 12; Plut. Marius.

29. Alius Ariovistus. A second Ariovistus. This is the name

of a German conqueror of large portions of Gaul, who was himself de­

sary tributes) is held in common by the Romans and the Gauls.

8. Laudatorum principum. Praiseworthy rulers. Ant. to

saevi, sc. principes. In like manner procul agentibus is ant. to

proximis. The design is to set forth the advantages of being gov­

erned by the Romans at a distance, rather than by their own princes

at home. See the same argument used by Sulla (Sal. Jug. 102): in

quo (sc. the distance of the Romans) offensae minimum, gratia par ac

si prope adessemus.

12. Sed neque .... et. Neque correl. to et, and = et non: in

the first place, these are not perpetual, and in the next, they are coun­

terbalanced by the better rulers that intervene.

IT. Q,uid allud quam bella, etc. So Sallust represents the

Roman ompire under Julius Caesar as the universal bond of peace and

safety, and Plutarch speaks of it as the anchor of a fluctuating world.

19. Compages haee. This fabric, more exactly bond, enclosure.
