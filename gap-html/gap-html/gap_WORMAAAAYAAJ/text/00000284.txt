280 NOTES.

13. Castra, sc. praetoriana.—Juvenis. Dod. places a comma af­

ter juvenis, thus making his youth a separate reason for Piso's being

sent before Galba, who, if not too old to meet the danger, was thought

less likely to win favor.

14. Nomine and favorc are abl. of quality.—Recenti favore refers

to his late adoption, i. e. elevation to imperial favor.

15. Irati. The enemies of Vinius, particularly Laco and Icelus,

who had now gained the ascendency in Galba's counsels. Vinius (ad

advised not to go to the camp; Galba not only went, but was pre­

ceded by one who was thought or hoped to he the personal enemy of

Vinius.—Facilius .... creditur. And the more credible account of

the two is, that he was really infensus Vinio.

1T. Ut.... mendaciis, sc. fieri solet, i. e. great lies are apt to gain

strength, till at length men are ready to swear to their personal know­

ledge of their truth.

18. Credula fama. Credula is usually taken in a passive

sense, here = readily believed, easily credited. So Ernesti, Boetti-

cher, Dod. and others ; though Ernesti suggests also the explanation

adopted by Roth., Wr., Rup. and Or., viz. that fama is put poetically

for the men who spread and believed the report. Then credula may

be taken in its ordinary sense, as in 12: credulum senem. Fama is

not unfrequently personified by T. Cf. A. 9 ; Ann. 4, IX. Render:

Rumor being credulous where men delight in reports and are indif­

ferent about their truth.

SI. Vulgaverint. Al. vulgaverant. The reading we have given

follows the Medicean MS. and accords with the general rule for de­

pendent clauses in the oratio obliqua. Cf. Gr. 266, 2; Z. 603.

Ch. XXXV.—23. In plausus, sc. mere, or prorumpere implied in

mere by zeugma: break forth into shouts of applause. Cf. Essay ou

the Style of Tacitus, p. 15.—Equitum .... senatorum. Who from

their rank might have been expected to be more cautious. Equites

moans, 1. Horsemen, or cavalry. 2. Knights, or men of tho equestrian

order; for in the early history of Rome men of rank only served in

the cavalry, while tho plebs made up the infantry. So in Hor. do Ar.

Poet.: quibus est equus = equestres.

25. Iutus. Only the equites and senatores rushed in; the popu-

lus and plebs applauded immoderately without. For the distinction

between populus and plebs, cf. note, A. 43: vulgus et populus.

2T. Ijinguae ferocis. Al. linguae feroces, Unguis feroces. All

the MSS. but one have linguae ferocis, which is gen. of quality, and

is the more likely to be the true reading, because it is of different con­

struction from nimii verbis. Cf. note, G. 16. 18, and Essay, p. 23.

28. Inopia veri = inopia certorum nuntiorum. So veri is ex.

plained by tho antithetic errantium. Inopia is not, therefore, as Rup.

and others say, = ignorantia. Galba was overcome by the entiit
