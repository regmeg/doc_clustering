Book r. 247

hft

fore should not stand at the beginning of a new sentence. The whole gj

passage thus re^d and pointed may be summed up as follows:—

1. He states the date with which he intends to begin his history, viz.

the second consulship of Galba = a. u. c. 822. 2. He gives the

reason why he does not commence at an earlier date, viz. that many

have written the history of the whole period prior to that date.

3. But he subdivides that whole period into two parts, viz. the Repub­

lic and the Empire, the former of which has boen treated with as

much freedom as eloquence, but not so the latter. Tacitus may have

already had in mind the plan, which he afterwards executed (in his

Annals), of writing also the history of the latter period, because,

though written by many, it had been treated without ability or

impartiality. Cf. Ann. 1, 1, a passage which sheds much light on this.

5. Actium. Where Augustus defeated Antony and established

himself in the sole possession of the supreme power.—Potentiam. AL

potestatem. Potestas est i^ovota, potentia 56vafus. So Wr.,* who argues,

that not omnis potestas, all lawful authority, but omnis potentia, all

power and might was concentred in one man, that he might preserve

peace. For this distinction, cf. His. 1, 13; Ann. 3, 69; Cic. pro

domo, 30. See also Or. in loc.

6. Conferri = brought together, united in one man.

7« Siruul veritas, etc. See a similar passage in Dion, 53, 19.

8. Ut alienae. Since it was the property of another, i. e. the

emperor, not the people. So Wr., Or. and Dod. As if it were a for­

eign state; for they had no more to do with it, and therefore cared

and knew no more about it, than if it were a foreign republic. So

Ernesti. A truly republican sentiment, according to either interpre­

tation. The former is preferable.—Rursus. Cf. note A. 29.

9. Iufensos. Sc. principibus.

10. Ambltionem. Lit., going about to solicit favor. Hence

flattery to the great, explained below by adulationi.

11. Adverseris. So the MSS., Wr. and Dod. Al. averseris,

Rup., Or. But without good authority or reason. For the accusative

after adversor, cf. Gr. 224, R. 4; Z. 386. Also Freund's Lexicon,

sub voce. For the subjunctive here, cf. Gr. 260, II.; Z. 523. You

may easily withstand or resist. Wr. refers it to the writer: You

(any writer) may easily withstand the temptation to flatter. This is

moro pertinent to the connection. But scriptoris suggests rather the

idea, that the reader can easily withstand, etc. So Rup. and most

others.—Pronis auribus, literally, ears inclining or bending forward

= willing ears.

* The Authorities most frequently cited in these Notes, are cited by their  
initial letters or syllables, thus: Wr. = Walther, Rup. => Ruperti; Or. =

Orelli; Dod. = DSderlein, &c Gr stands for Andrews and Stodd&rd'l
