want of true accounts and the agreement of those who brought false

reports.

ioBcvfis ra vtvpa. Xiphil. 64, 3. (The reference is to the abridgment

of Dion Cassius by Xiphilinus, which alone is preserved in most of

this period.)

30. Sistens = resistens, obsistens, as in Virg. Aen. 11, 240. Cf.

Essay, p. 10. Vid. Dod. in loc. Render: since he was neither of

suitable age nor bodily strength to withstand the now in-rushing

multitude.—Sella. Cf. note, 27. The sella here, however, appears

to have been uncovered (cf. 41), perhaps to suit the military character

and taste of Galba.—Levaretur. The subj. after donee, where a fact

and not a mere conception or purpose is expressed. This is contrary

to the rule. Cf. note, 13 : donee .... amoliretur. But it is frequent

with Tacitus, who comparatively seldom uses the indie, after donee,

until, and then without any apparent difference of meaning. Cf. Gr.

263, 4; Z. 575. It is worthy of remark, however, that Tacitus uses

the subj. after donee where he has occasion for the imperfect. Whore

the sense requires the perfect, he uses the indie. The only exception

to this usage, so far as I have observed, is in 1, 9: donee .... aderat.

Donee, so long as, is always followed by the indicative, in oratio recla.

Cf. 37: donee .... dubitabitur.

33. Q,uis jussit. " My oath and. my duty," replied the soldier.

See Plut. Galb. 19. But T. wishing to illustrate only the character

of Galba, omits the reply.

Ch. XXXVI.—3T. Agmine et corporibus. Hendiadys for agmine

facto suis corporibus. Bach. The force of circumdprent reaches

back to this clause: not content with surrounding him by their own

persons in a body. Vid. Or. and Duebner in loco. On the mode and

tense of circumdarent, cf. note, chap. 24 : dederit.

38. Suggestu = tribunali, i. e. at the headquarters of the com­

mander, where the statue of the emperor was always placed. Manual,

P. 3, 296. (The reference is to Eschenburg's Manual of Classical

Literature: Fiske's Edition.)

1. Signa... .. vexillis. The distinction intended between these^y

words in this place is not clear. It may be that of their original appli­

cation, viz. signa referring to the infantry, and vexilla to the cavalry.

More probably, however, vexillis is used in the same sense as in 31,

where see note. Then signa would denote the standards of the co­

horts which made up the legions (Hispana and Classica), and vexilla

those of the electi Gcrmanid,Britannid et Illyrid exercitus. Cf. 6.

3. Caveri. Observe the passive form: should be watched with a

jealous eye.—Insuper. Furthermore, i. e. besides precluding the near

approach of the tribunes and centurions, they bade each other beware

furthermore of all their officers.
