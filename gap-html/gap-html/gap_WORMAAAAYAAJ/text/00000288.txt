284 NOTES.

^ 13. Nee .... togata. And the single,unarmed cohort does not,

etc. The cohort on guard was not fully armed, and wore the toga 01

dross of citizens, not the sagum of the regular military sorviee. Lipsius.

15. Quia .... imputet, i. e. quis pro me acrius contendendo effi-

ciat, ut ei plus debeam. Ernesti. Cf. note, G. 21. Used in this sense

by poets and later Latin authors. Render: who can lay me under

the greatest obligation. Subj. in the indirect question. Cf. Gr. 265;

Z. 552.

16. Conctationis. So Rup. and Or. from the Medicean MS. Cf.

Liv. 3, 46: locum seditionis quaerere. Al. cunctationi.

17. Aperire. Al. aperiri, which is a needless conjecture. He

then ordered them to open the arsenal. Many of these troops, like

the cohort at the palace-gate, were not fully armed, i. e. had no de­

fensive armor, galeis scutisque, which were allowed to the praetorian

cohorts only at the command of the praefect or tribune. Lipsius. Cf

note on cohors togata.

18. Ut.... distiugucrctur. This clause depends on more et

ordine, and denotes the nature or the object of that military custom.

The legionary troops were armed with pila, the praetorians with lan-

ceae, etc. Ritter.

SO. Miscentur ... scutisque. Prattorian and legionary troops

seize indiscriminately on shields and helmets that belong to auxili­

aries. Auxiliaribus agrees with galeis scutisque. Galea and scu­

tum are among the few military terms which have a common ety­

mology in the Greek and the Latin; whereas the names of common

things in agriculture and the arts of peace almost all have a common

origin in the two languages, the Pelasgi, who contributed the common

element, being an agricultural and pacific people. Cf. Niebuhr's His.

of Rome: also Arnold, chap. 2; Keightley, chap. 1; and Schmitz,

chap. 1.

Ch. XXXIX.—24. Exterritus. Frightened out of his purpose

city, at the Viminal gate. Rup. Cf. note, 37: auditisne.—Egressum

interim. Who had gone forth from the palaco (cf. 35) in the mean

time, i. e. the intorval between Piso's egress (34) and the events here

described.

26. Assecutus erat. Had come up tc, fallen in with.

2T. Marius Ceisus. Cf. 31.

28. Redire, sc. Galbam et Pisonem.—Plerique. Many, very

many ; ^ot most, for it includes less than plures. Cf. 4, 84.

29. Plures. More.—Contradicerent. Subj. Cf. Gr. 263 , 5, R.

2; Z. 578.

33. Ad postremum vel odio. A conjectural reading, suggested

by Rheuanus and adopted by most editors, not because it satisfies, but
