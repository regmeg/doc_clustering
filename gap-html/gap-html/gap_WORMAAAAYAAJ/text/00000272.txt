ted, as were also the praetorian guards, by Augustus. Dio Cass. 55,26.

Cf. 5; also Suet. Galb. 16. It is implied, that all expected to lose their

places, as the cashiered tribunes were driven from (pellerentur) theirs,

not however in a mass, for that the emperor was afraid to do, but in

detail (singuli, one by one). For this use of pellerentur, cf. 4, 44:

pulsi — banished; and 4, 46: pelli = dismissed, removed from

office. It is the simple for the compound.

Ch. XXI.—36. Ivuxuria... inopia, etc. In apposition with multa.

As to Otho's inopia, cf. Suet. Oth. 5, whore ho says that nothing short

of the imperial power could save him from utter ruin, and whether ho

died in battle or fell a victim to his creditors was immaterial.

subj. in the dependent clauses. Cf. Gr. 266, 2 ; Z. 603.

nuum ab uno ad alterum transit . Cf. res translatae, 29. Ernesti.

11. Acrioris viri. A man of superior energy and courage.

12. Merito. In a manner worthy of himself, i. e. in bold under­

takings. The word is designedly ambiguous.

Otho's person below, 30, and places cited there.

16. Matrimonia. The frequent marriages of Nero. Cf. 13;

Suet. Nero, 28.35. The same was true of Caligula and Claudius, the

former of whom had had four wives and the latter six. Suet. Cal. 24.
