T. Inopijuventa is the cause of prodigus.

8. Ipsa itinerant, etc., i. e. induced by bribes not to encamp at

certain towns or country places, but to march farther, or stop short, or

take another diroction.

11. Uuco. Lucus Augusti, now Luc. Cf. Plin. 3,4.

12. Admoverit. Compare the completed action expressed by

admoverit with the prolonged anxiety and suspense denoted by arbi-

trarentur at the beginning of the section, or with the continued series

of acts denoted by occurrerent in chap. 63. Cf. note, 24: dederit.—

Donee .... mitigaretur. Cf. note, 35: levaretur.

13. Q,uotiens . deesset. The subj. denoting a repeated ac­

tion. Gr. 264, 12; Z. 569.—Materia, i. e. facultas dandae. Ernesti.

Ch. LXVII.—15. Plus praedae. More than Valens. The po­

sition of plus gives it emphasis, = still more.—Hausit must be taken

in a somewhat different sense with these two objects respectively: he

took more booty and shed more blood. D6d. Cf. Essay, 16.

16. Helvetii. The territory of the Helvetii was a part of Celtic

Gaul, more extensive than what is now called Switzerland. The peo­

ple are celebrated by Julius Caesar for their military virtue and constant

warfare with the Germans. Caes. B. G. 1, 1. Murphy.

IT. Clara agrees with gens, ignari with Helvetii. Cf. Gr. 205,

R. 3.

19. Avaritia ac festinatio = avaritia ardens by hendiadys. So

Ch. LXVIII.—32. Jfon arma noscere = non usum armorum

scire. So Wr., Dod. and Or. But Rup. prefers another explanation:

non arma noscere quisque sua, sed promiscue rapere ; which accords

better with the context and the prevailing usage of Tacitus, who em­

ploys noscere in the sense of recognise, distinguish, cf. 3, 24: nos­

cere suos noscique; 1,90: genus ipsum orandi noscerent; or else

he employs it in the sense of being or becoming acquainted with per­

sons, e. g. 1, 51: centurias .... suas .... noverant. The former of

these uses is hardly found in Cicero. Cf. Freund sub voce.

35. Ipsorum Raetorum juventus, i. e. volunteers, in distinction

from those who had enlisted in the Roman army (alae cohortesque).

38. Montem Vocetium. Est pars asperrima Jurae. Oberlin.
