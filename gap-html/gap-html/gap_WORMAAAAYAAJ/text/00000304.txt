reference to the peculiar bitterness of local animosities exceeding even

the fury of civil war.

prostrate on the ground, and following up, as it were, the averted and

departing footsteps of the soldiers.

38. Tum, sc. after money had been given them, then the soldiers

began to think of the antiquity and dignity of the colony. The lan­
