BOOk r. 291

for sale, from vendo. Tho word is found only in T Incuriosus (

also is peculiar to his age.

5. Avarus, avaricious ; parens, saving. Avarus is the stronger

word.—Vbi.... incidisset. Plup. subj., to denote a repeated action.

Cf. Gr. 264, 12 ; Z. 569.

6. Sine reprehensioue = excusably. Ant. to usque ad culpam,

which implies the contrary. As to this culpa in Galba, cf. 7 and 12.

8. Quod segnltia .... vocaretur. He was thought to have

prudently concealed his abilities and repressed his activity, because of

tho dangers which attended men of high birth in those perilous times,

somewhat as Brutus did under Tarquin. Cf. A. 6: gnarus sub Nerone

temporum, quibus inertia pro sapientia fuit. See Doderlein's note

in Ioc.

9. Pro consule. Al. proconsul. The sense is the same with

either reading. A proconsul is one who acts in the place of a consul,

without holding the consular office. It was usual in the later periods

of the Roman state, for the consuls, on the expiration of their office, to

take the government of a province with consular power. The pro-

consulship was, therefore, a continuation, though a modified one, of

the consulship. Cf. Diet, of Gr. and Rom. Antiq.

11. Continult, sc. in fide et officio = rexit. Cf. retinere, 11.—

Major .... imperasset. A principle 6ften verified by facts; and here

expressed in language which the reader will not soon forget, but which

Monboddo censures as affected.

Ch. L.—1*. Paventem. Properly, palpitating with fear (from

pavio, Gr. *atu). A stronger word than timens, or metuens.

15. Exterruit. Ex only gives emphasis here. But cf. exterri-

tus, 39.

16. Superioris .... descivisse. Cf. 12.—Crederetur. Impers.

The more frequent construction in the early Latin would be exercitus

crederetur. Cf. note, G. 32: narratur.

21. Saevae pacis. Galba fell without a blow struck in his defence.

It could not, therefore, be called civil war; but it was a cruel and

bloody peace. Cf. 2: ipsa etiam pace saevum.—Exempla is the obj.

of loquebantur, and memoria is abl. abs. with repetita, though improp­

erly followed by a colon in the common editions.

23. Pharsaliam. Where Pompey was conquered by Julius Ca?-

sar, a. u. 706.—Philippos. Where Brutus and Cassius were defeated

and slain by Octavius and Antony, a. u. 712.

24r. Perusiam. Where Antony was reduced to submission by

Octavius, a. v. 713.—Mutinam (now Modena), where the consuls,

Hirtius and Pansa, the last who enjoyed with full power the dignity of

chief magistrates of Rome, were slain in a battle with the murderen

of Julius Caesar, a. u. 711.

25. Loquebautur = they talked of.
