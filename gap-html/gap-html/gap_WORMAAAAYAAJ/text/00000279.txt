P«i»

35. Quidam minora. Sub. dicentes implied in augentes. Zeug-^jj

ma.—Ne tum quidem. Not even in such a crisis. Z. 801.

36. Igitur. Rarely placed first in Cic. Cf. Z. 357 ; andKiihner's

Cic. Tusc. Qu. 1, 6, 11. Usually first in T., but sometimes in tho

second place. Cf. note on G. 28.

38. Majoribus remediis, i. e. temporibus, quao majus remedium

postularent. Ernesti.

I. Pro gradibus. From the steps. So pro tribunali, from the 44

tribunal; pro rostris, from the rostrum ; pro muris, from the walls;

pro vallo, from the rampart, &c. Cf. Z. 311.—Domus = palatii. Cf.

27: Tiberianam domum.

S2. Sextus dies. Counting the day of his adoption as the first (as

the Romans and also the Greeks and Hebrews always reckoned), and

the present as the sixth. Leaving out both, there were but four days

intervening. Cf. 19: quatriduo. On the same principle we may

reconcile the 8 days of Luke, 9, 28, with the 6 days of Mat. 17, 1,

and Mark, 9, 2. In the same way also we make out the 3 days of

our Lord's sepulture.

4. Quo .... fato. Al. quo .... fatum, which is the reading of

most of the MSS. The Medicean has fata. I have chosen fato with

Dod. and Or., because it makes the sense so much more spirited: with

what fortune to our family or the state depends on your decision

(literally, has been placed in your hands).

5. Non quia .... paveam. Cf. note, 15 : non quia .... non.

Doleo is to be supplied before quia .... paveam from the antithesis.

—Meo nomine. On my own account — for myself. Antithetic to

patris et senatus. Cf. note on feminarum nomine, G. 8.

6. Ut qui .... discam. Since I am such a person .... that I

may learn. Cf. Gr. 264, 8; Z. 565, N. 1; 726.—Adversas ... expertus.

Cf. note on fortunam adversam, 15, supra.

T. Cum maxime = ut cum maxime (cf. G. 10, note): may learn,

as when men learn most, i. e. may learn most effectually. The cum

adds emphasis to maxime. Cf. Freund sub quum.

8. Patris. Sub. sed before it, often omitted by T. Cf. Essay or

the Style of Tacitus, p. 13.

lO. Proximi motus. When Galba was made emperor.

II. Incruentam urbem. The ooly sense in which this is true,

is, that no blood of citizens was shed in the city. Thousands of sol­

diers were slain as he was entering the city. Cf. chap. 6.

12. Ut ne .... esset. That not even after Galba (i. e. at the

close of his reign) there should be room for (civil) war. Ne quidem

marks the antith. between post Galbam and proximi motus. Cf. Gr.

279, 3 : quidem and quoque; Z. 801.

Ch. XXX.—15. Relatu. A word now found only in Tacitus. Or

IT. Imperatoris, sc. Nero. Cf. 13.—Agerel. When he wot
