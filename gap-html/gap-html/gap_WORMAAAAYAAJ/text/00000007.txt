PREFACE.

ThE text of this edition follows, for the most part, Oielli's,

Zurich, 1848, which, being based on a new and most faithful

recension of the Medicean MS. by his friend Baiter, may just足

The editions which have been most consulted, whether in

the criticism of the text or in the preparation of the notes,

Hanover, 1839; and Dbderlein, Halle, 1847. The notes of

Orelli are judicious and tasteful. Walther is sagacious, shrewd

and independent, sometimes to a fault. Ruperti's edition is

chiefly valuable as a repository of facts and opinions, selected

with no great care and put together with little skill. Doder-

Tacitus, besides this fault in the matter, is also wanting in

ease and elegance of language; yet it has been esteemed

worthy to be translated for this edition, as on the whole one

of the best treatises on that subject. Botticher's Lexicon

Taciteum, Berlin, 1830, is marked by a felicitous expression,

as well as a just appreciation, of our author's merits as a his足
