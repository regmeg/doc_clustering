23. I,uppla. A branch of the Rhine, now the Lippe in West­

phalia.—Veledae. Cf. 4, 61, and note, ibid, on more, quo, etc.

Ch. XXIII.—24. Incessit. Invades, seizes. Cf. 2, 63: ubi

formido incessisset.

25. Complet. Furnishes with sailors and soldiers, mans. So in

Greek, ,rAi/pou* vaSs. Cf. Herod. 8, 43.—Quod .... agebantur. All

his galleys with two banks of rowers, and those which were propelled

by a single bank. This is referred to as a test passage, as to the

meaning of biremes, triremes, etc. Cf. Ernesti and Rup. in loc.

26. Triceiios. Observe the distributive force = three hundred

men each.

2T. Armamenta. The rigging of these boats was similar to

that of the Roman liburnae. But the captured boats were fitted out

in a unique manner, sagulis versicoloribus.—Captae lintres, sc. those

taken from the Romans. Cf. 22: captivis navibus. Al. aptae lintres.

The reading of the whole sentence is doubtful and perplexed.

More in wonder than in fear, lit. from the wonderfulness, sc. of the

fact that Civilis should venture on such an engagement. Cf. 1, 27:

miraculo.

35. His. The latter, sc. Cerialis and his followers.—Illi. The

former, sc. the partisans of Civilis.

1. Intactos. Al. intaetas.—Nota arte. According to a iceZZ-226

known policy, with a view to excite the jealousy of Civilis' followers,

as if he must have some understanding with the Roman general.

Hannibal pursued the same policy in reference to the estates of Fabius

in Italy. Liv. 22, 23.—Flexu autumni. Near the close of autumn,

lit. at its turning point . Cf. Cic. pro Cael.: flexu aetatis ; Ann. 1,16:

flexo in vesperam die.

5. Diflerebantur = dirimebantur, were separated, torn asunder.

This is the primary meaning of differo. See Freund, sub voce. Cf.

also Hor. Epod. 5, 99: insepulta membra different lupi. Al. defere-

bantur.

Ch. XXIV.—6. Potuisse .... Civilis. That the legions might

at this time have been destroyed, and that the Germans wished it

done, but were diverted from the purpose by a fraudulent device of

his own, Civilis claimed should be set down to his credit. Cf. note,

1, 71: ultra imputavit.

T. Neque abhorret vero. Nor is this irreconcilable with the

truth. Observe the omission of o before vero. See the more common

construction in 2, 2: neque abhorrebat a Berenice. But in Ann. 1,

54, we have abhorrebat studiis without a Poetical, Z. 468.
