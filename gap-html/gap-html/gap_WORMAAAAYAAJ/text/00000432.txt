IT. Per omnem .... libidinem. We see in the character here

given of Felix, a good reason why he tremhled while Paul reasoned

25), as well as a striking illustration of the Apostle's boldness in thus

indirectly arraigning his own judge.

daughter (nepte) Drusilla. The word is post-Augustan.—Claudius

nepos. Claudius was son of Antouia, the daughter of Antony.
