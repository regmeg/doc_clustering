Book iv. 396

Fagi

Ch. XVII.—15. Germauiae. Upper and Lower Germany, not jyg

Germany proper. Cf. note, 1, 9.

26. Vindicis aciem. Cf. note, 1, 8. Civilis artfully calls it a

battle (aciem), not, as it really was, a defeat and slaughter (cladem).

And he proceeds immediately to impute the success of the opposite

army to the valor of the Batavian horse, who were now under his

command: it was by the Batavian horse (under Verginius) that the

JEdui (under Vindex) and the Arverni (hodie, Auvergne) were tram­

pled under foot 2T. Verginli. Cf. noto, 1, 8: Vindicis.

29. Addito agrees with the following clause, which is thus put in

the abl. abs.: with the addition of all the discipline, etc.

30. Esse sccum .... procubuerint. Observe the present and

perfect here in the oratio obliqua. We can use only the imperfect

and pluperfect (if we use the present and perfect, we must say we and

us, in other words adopt the oratio recta); the Latins may use either

class of tenses with the same subject, se. Cf. note, 1, 32: si poeniteat.

33. Ante tributa. The reference here is to tho census and tri­

bute imposed on the Gauls by Augustus, a. u. c. 727. Cf. Ann. 1,31.

33.-34. Caeso Varo. Cf. G. 37, note.

Ch. XVIII.—5. Flaccus Hordeonius. Observe the inverted or- jyg

der of the names Flaccus Hordeonius. Cf. 1,9: Hordeonius Flaccus,

which in early times was always the order, but often disregarded in

later times. Cf. Z. 797, and note on the names of Agricola, A. 4.

7. Romanum nomen = Romanos omnes. So Livy, passim.

lO. E praesentibus. Of those on the spot. E proximis. Of

those nearest at hand.—11. Agcntis. Cf. note, 16: volentis.

15. Ut gloria. Sub. esset. Cf. Essay, p. 14.

19. Jfequaquam .... clamor. Ominous of defeat. Cf. note,

G. 3 : terrent.

24. Totis campis. The abl. with totus, denoting place, usually

stands without a prep. Cf. Z. 482.

2T. Oppidauo certamine. In their competition, as townsmen,

for tho pre-eminence.—29. Avehitur, sc. by Civilis.

Ch. XIX.—30. Batavorum .... cohortes. Auxiliares Roma-

norum ex istis populis scriptas. Ernesti.

33. Pretium .... donativum. These words are in apposition:

they demanded as the price of their march, a donative, double pay,

and an increase of the number of horse (the cavalry had easier ser­

vice and better pay); all which had, in fact (sane), been promised

them by Vitellius.

2. Mox .... ministris. Presently influenced by his natural J77

sluggishness (cf. 1, 9) and by the fears of his subordinates. Abl. of

cause, limiting statuit.

5. Dein .... ipsis. Afterwards changing his purpose and cen­

sured by the very persons who, etc. Dein is correlative to mox.
