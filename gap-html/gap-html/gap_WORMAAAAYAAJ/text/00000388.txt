36. Sabinus, etc. Eutropius (7, 12) and Victor (Caes. 8) make

Sabinus to have perished in the burning of the Capitol; while Suet

.

(Dom. 10) says he was put to death by Domitian. Xiph. (65, 17)

agrees with T.

Jfjt) 1. Euavatae. So the MSS. The common editions have no­

tar,ze. Ititter observes a fondness in T. for the use of e in composi­

tion to denote consummation. Cf. evicta, 2,64.

5. Absciso is omitted in the common editions, but is found in all

the MSS., and is not superfluous : his head having been cut off, they

drag his mutilated body.

■ub voce.

Ch. LXXV.—8. In republica. As we say, in the service of his

the words superfluous, or at least misplaced.

27. Periculum is the object of audebant, which takes an acc.

Cf. Gr. 229, R 2. In the other clause, audebant is followed by an

inf. (egredi). For the case of moenia, cf. Gr. 233, R. 1. It is pecu­

liar to the age of T. to use the acc. after verbs compounded with e or

ex. Sail, and Liv. use the abl.; Cic. the abl. with ex repeated. Cf.

Z. 386.—Ut.... memoravimus. Cf. 57, supra.

28. L,ascivia .... similes. The common editions connect this

clause with the next sentence, to the manifest injury of the sense and

spirit
