own, besides those which encompass the whole city. Cf. note, 8 pri-

mis .... clausum.—Lahore ad magnitudinem murorum, opere ad

18. Fous perennis. Jerusalem has always been found to possess

an inexhaustible supply of water for the most protracted siege, even

when the besieging armies, as for instance that of the crusaders, have

suffered intolerably from thirst. A mystery still overhangs the source

of this supply. Large cisterns are known to exist. But "there is

also good ground to believe, that there has also been from very ancient

times an unfailing source of water derived by secret and subterranean

channels from springs to the west of the town, and communicating by

other subterraneous passages with the pool of Siloam and the fountain

of the Virgin in the east of the town." Cf. Kitto's Cyclopasdia, art.

Jerusalem, Waters of; Strab. Geog. 16, 2, 40.

19. Cavati.... montes, i. e. the mountains, on which the city

was built, were scooped out into subterranean caverns. These were

used for places of concealment, as well as for cisterns of water. Cf.

Xiph. 66, 4 ; Ammian. Marcel. 19, 5, 4. Here as usual T. avoids the

technical expression, specus subterranei.—Piscinae cisternaeque. Im­

mense cisterns of great antiquity still exist within the area of the tem­

ple, supplied partly by rain-water and partly by an aqueduct from

Solomon's pools, and which of themselves would furnish a tolerable

supply in case of a siege. Cf. Bib. Cyclop., art. Cisterns. See also

for many interesting and instructive details on this wholo subject,

pp. 168-181.

ftS. Magna colluvie. A great conflux from the country, as

well as from the cities already destroyed by the Romans. The siege

of Titus took place at the time of the annual feast of the Passover,

when all the adult male population wore expected to go up to Jerusalem.

21. Tres duces, etc. Cf. Joseph. B. J. 5, 1-6.

28. Q,uem Bargioram, i. e. son of Gioras. This clause

stands after Joannes in the Medicean MS. and the earliest editions. It

may perhaps have been written so by T. through ignorance. But that

the surname belongs to Simon is evident from Joseph. B. J. 2, 23, and

4,7.
