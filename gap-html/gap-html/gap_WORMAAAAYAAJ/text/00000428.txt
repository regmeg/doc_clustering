424 NOTES.

2jy 29. Fidumque nlvibus. Faithful to the snow, i. e. affording \

a safe and permanent resting-place.—Idem, sc. Libanus.

3 2. Sapore corruptior. In taste more offensive, sc. than the sea

33. Neque veuto impellitur. Compare with this the following

from the letters of Lieut. Lynch of the recent U. S. Exploring Expe­

dition : " The boats, heavily laden, struggled sluggishly at first, but

when the wind freshened to a gale, it seemed as if the bows, so dense

was the water, were encountering the sledge-hammers of the Titans,

instead of the opposing waves of an angry sea When we were

near the shore, and while I was weighing the practicability of landing

the boats through the surf, the wind suddenly ceased, and with it the

sea rapidly fell, the ponderous quality of the water causing it to settle

as soon as the agitating power had ceased. Within five minutes, there

was a perfect calm, and the sea was unmoved even by undulation."

34. Suet as . .. volucres. A pure fiction.—Incertae .. .ferunt.

The waves, if waves they may be called, bear up things thrown upon

them, as if placed on a solid structure, e. g. on a boat . Incertae, lit

of a doubtful nature, sc. because they exhibit so imperfectly the motion

of waves, or the fluidity of water. The great specific gravity of the

Dead Sea is well authenticated, and explains the remarkable buoyan­

cy attributed to its waters. Cf. Robinson's Researches in Palestine,

vol. ii. p. 213. 4

35. Periti Imperitique . .. perinde. The use of perinde with

que as a connective between the things compared is peculiar to T. and

writers of his age. Cf. Freund and Boet . Lex. Tac.

36. Certo aimi. In the autumn.—Bitumen. Hence the name

of the lake, Asphaltites. Cf. Plin. N. H. 5, 16.—Egerit. It sends

np, casts forth, from e and gero.

2J8 *• sic veteres auctores, e. g. Plin. N. H. 7, 13 ; 28, 23 ; Joseph.

P>. J. 4, 8. But how absurd, as T. fully perceived.

Ch. VII.—lO. Fulminum jactu. The use of jactu here has

been objected to, and ictu and tactu have been substituted for it . But

jactu is justified by the example of Cic. in Cat. 3,8; de Div. 2, 18;

Liv. 28, 27, et al. Ad rem, cf. Gen. 19, 24. 25.

11. Vestigia, sc. of ruined cities. Strabo (16, 2) and Josephus

(4, 8, 4) both testify to the existence of these ruins. Seo the names

of the five principal cities of the plain, Gen. 14, 2.

12. Nam cuiicta, etc. For all the productions of the soil, wheth­

er of spontaneous growth or cultivated by the hand of man, either

in the state of herbage or of blossom, or when they have grown to

maturity with their usual outward appearance, etc. Al. herbae

tenues autflores.

14. Atra ... vanescunt. See a similar account in Joseph. B. J

4, 8, 4. Compare also the allusion to the vine of Sodom and the fruit

of Gomorrah, Deut. 32, 32. The apples and gra;<es c, Sodom are a
