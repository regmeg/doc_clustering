commander in the reigns of Claudius and Nero, in Germany (Ann. -ina

11, 18), in Armenia (Ann. 13, 8), Syria and Parthia (14,24; 15,25.

et al); put to death by Nero.. H. 2, 76.

12. Secretis .... sermonibus. In private interviews with

Nero. Al. rurnoribus, with less authority and a less appropriate

sense.

14« Primum pilum. Cf. 1,31: primipilaribus, note: having

obtained the office of first centurion through the scandalous favor

(of Nero) thus gained (unde, i. e. crimmando Corbulonem), his pres­

ent prosperity, ill acquired, afterwards proved his ruin, perhaps

under Domitian, who married the daughter of Corbulo. Ryckius.

16. Occupata ... quaeque. Al. occupantes Aquileiae proximo

quaeque. Having gained possession of Aquileia, they are received

into all the neighboring places, etc. Aquileia, Altinum and Opiter*

gium were towns at or near the head of the Adriatic, in the territory

of the Veneti. The names of the last two are still preserved in

Oderzo and the ruined tower of Altino.—In is not found in any MS.

Baiter would supply per instead of it. Dod. leaves proximo quaeque

without a preposition, as acc. of place.

— 19. Patavium. Cf. note, 2, 100.—Ateste was near Patavium,

in the territory of Venice; now Este.

- 21. Forum Allieni. Now Ferrara on the Po.

22. Id quoque, sc. that they were off their guard, as well as that

they were there.

—23. Praedictum = praeceptum, mandatum. Cf. note, 4, 53:

praedixere.

Ob. VII.—2T. Vulgata victoria limits veniunt, and together

with post principia ... Flavianos assigns the reason for the coming

. of the two legions: When this victory was published abroad, now

that (post, lit . after) the commencement of the war was favorable to

the Flavian party.

28. Duae legiones. Al. datae legiones. These two legions be­

longed in Pannonia (2, 86), the 7th uuder the command of Autonius

(ibid rr the 13th under that of Vedius Aquila (2, 44). Antonius had

left them behind at first (cf. 2, supra: continete legiones); but now

they were glad to share with him in his victories, agreeably to his pre-

■-diction: juvabit sequi, etc.

31. Praefectus castrorum. Cf. note, 2,26.—Adductius. With

tighter rein. Cf. note, G.43. The use of the adv. in this sense is po.

culiar to T. Boetticher.

33T Desiderata .... -res, sc. the restoration of Galba to duo

honor; for his memory became dear after the crimes and calamities

of the next two reigns. Dod., Eup. and Rit. refer res more specifically

to the military discipline of Galba, suggested by the same severity

just mentioned of Minucius Justus.
