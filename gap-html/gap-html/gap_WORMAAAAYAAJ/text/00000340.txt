3 NOTES.

35. Sepulcrum .... mansurum, bc. ob modestiam : and there­

fore likely to last. So Murphy translates, and adds the following

note: Plutarch tells us (Oth. 18) that he* himself visited Otho's tomb

at Brixellum. Those perishable monuments have long since moul­

dered away ; but the epitaph written by Martial will never die. The

poet admits that Otho led a dissolute life, but adds that in his end, he

was no way inferior to Cato. Cf. Mart . 6, 31.

Ch. L.—36. Hunc finem. Cf. note on hunc exitum, 1, 49.—

Septimo et tricesimo. The 38th according to Suet. (Oth. 11), who

always includes in such computations both the year of birth and of

death. Wr. Cf. note on sextus dies, 1, 28.

3T. Origo, i. e. of his family, not his own birthplace.—Ferentio.

A town of Etruria, different from the Ferentinum so often mentioned

by Livy, though confounded with it by many commentators. Cf.

Suet. Oth. 1.

38* Materaum . . . Impar, etc., viz. Equestrian. Cf. Suet. Oth. 1.

1• dualem monstravimus. Cf. 1, 13.

2. Altero flagitiosissimo, sc. the dethronement of Galba, with

ita accompanying crimes.—Altero egregio, sc. his voluntary death,

with a view to terminate the civil war. It scarcely need be said that

the Christian, while he approves the motive (if this were the motive),

will condemn the means.

4r. Fabulosa. T. relates few prodigies in comparison with Sue­

tonius.

S. Crediderim .... ausim. Cf. note on crediderim, 1,83.

7. Invisitata = antea non visa. Al. inusitata.—Regium Lepi-

dum. A town of Gallia Cispadana, not far from Brixellum ; called

Lepidum from Aemilius Lepidus (Strab. 5); now Jteggio.—Celebri

luco. Al. loco. But the MSS. all have luco. Celebri may be either

frequented or celebrated. Cf. note, 1, 81.

12. Competisse, in the sense of agreement, is not found prior to

the age of Tacitus, and the word is very rarely used by the earlier

Latin authors.

Ch. LI.—13. Luctu ac dolore. Grief and pain. Grief for

Otho, pain for their own calamities. Cf. Dod. in loc.

14. Modo .... nune. Correlatives = modo .. . modo. A. 25.

1T. Aversam .... partem, s*> posticam et secretam. Rup.

18. Preces .... tulit, sc. to Caicina and Valens.

19. Concedentibus is abl., denoting not the cause, but the concom­

itant of venia impetrata. Cf. note on expulsis... professoribus. A. 2.

20. Flavium Sabinum. Prefect of the city and brother of

Vespasian. Cf. 1, 46, 77 ; 2, 36, and notes ibid.

Ch. LIL—23. Mutinae. Cf. 1, 50. The fact that the senators

were left at Mutina, was not mentioned in its place, though we are

told (1, 88) that they left Rome with Otho, comitum specie.
