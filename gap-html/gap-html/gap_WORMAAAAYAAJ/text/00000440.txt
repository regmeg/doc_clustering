438 NOTES.

226 l**« ^rcnls^u' Properly access (venlo, cf. Freund, sub voce), favor,

here pardon.—Veledam propinquosque. Veleda (cf. note, 22), and

her connection!, who served as internuntii numinis. Cf. 4, 65: de-

Uctu$ e propinquis.

12. Caesos Trcveros. Cf. 4, 71. 72.—Receplos Ubios. The

Ubii had been received back, i. e. had submitted and returned to their

former friendly relation to the Romans.

14. Exsulem...et extorrem. An exile and an outcast. These

words have a similar etymology (extorris from ex-terra, exsul from

ex-solum) and do not differ essentially in meaning. They are used

together by T. for emphasis, and with his usual fondness for pairs of

kindred words. Exsul denotes more frequently a legal banishment;

extorris a forcible expulsion.

17. Inde. On their side. Hinc. On his side, sc. that of Cerialia.

Observe the pairs of substantives in these two clauses. The sense may

be expressed by hendiadys thus: the guilt of injustice ... the revenge

of the gods ; though the connection in which they are placed by the

author, is more lively and energetic.

Ch. XXV.—81. Q,uid profectum. Al. perfectum. Cf. A. 17;

nihil prqfici ; A. 14: parum profid, etc.

24. Armis for ad arma. So T. often ; earlier writers seldom. Cf.

Essay, pp. 12. 13.

26. Non tributa .... Indici. Cf. G. 29 : nec tributis contem-

nuntur, etc.—Virtutem et viros. The valor of their men. Cf. note,

24, at the close.

29. Germanorum feminas. Such as Veleda, who were virtually

their sovereigns, though not formally; for a female sovereign was for

the most part deemed a disgrace by the Germans. Cf. G. 8 and 45.

30. Atrociora. Al. atrociore with rabie in the next clause. But

then the comparative has no force.

227 *-"n- XXVI.—1. Nabaliae. This name occurs nowhere else, and

it seems impossible to determine what river is meant. Brotier refers

it to the channel made by Drusus from the Rhine to the Yssel, Walc-

kenaer to the Yssel itself, etc. Cf. Ann. 2, 8.—Abrupta. Extremi­

ties, where the bridge was brolcen off.

2. Defenderer. Notice the middle sense.

3. Debebatur. Imp. ind. for ,mp. subj. Cf. Gr. 259, R. 4; Z.

519, b.

4. Inimica, hosttlia. Inimicus, qui nos odit, hostilis qui oppug-

nat. Facciolati and Forcellini's Lexicon.

7. Actus = incitatus. Al. accitus.

The concluding sentence is incomplete. The much vaunted Gallic

empire soon came to an end. The subsequent fortunes of Civilis are

not known. But from the offers made him (cf. chap. 24), it is inferred

that he received a full pardon.
