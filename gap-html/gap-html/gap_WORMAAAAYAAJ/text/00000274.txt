270 NOTES.

35. Vocans, appellando, agnoscere, requirere, juvare, iuse-

rendo, all express the means by which Otho courted the favor of the

soldiers, and all stand in the same logical relation to affectaverat, yet

the grammatical forms are strangely varied and intermingled by our

author's fondness for euallage. Cf. notes, G. 16 and 18.—Vocans

nomine. A means of popularity so much relied on at Rome, that great

men had a slave called nomenelator, whose business it was to know

the name of everybody, and communicate it, as occasion required, to

his master. Cf. Beck. Gall. Exc. 2, sc. 2.—Neroniani comitatus

Nero's retinue, who shared his vicious pleasures and applauded his

musical performances in the Roman theatres, and on his excursions

through Italy and Greece. Cf. the Augustani instituted for this pur­

pose. Ann. 14, 15 ; also Ann. 15, 33 ; Suet. Nero, 25.

36. Requirere aliquid is to inquire after or into any thing ; ag-

noscere, to recognise an old acquaintance. Agnoscet e refers to persons

and thiugs previously known, cognoscere to those not previously

known.

^2 !• Atrocius accipiebantur. These words are found together

only in Tacitus. So also aspere accipere. Ann. 4, 31. Cf. Boetticher.

3. Soliti, sc. sub Nerone (see note above).

4. Enitercntur, sc. duce Galba ex Hispania Romam redeunte.

Rup. To justify this contrast, we must suppose, what T. nowhero

asserts in his extant works, that some of Nero's praetorians went to

meet and escort Galba from Spain. Eniterentur is followed by the acc.

Cf. Gr. 233, R. I. It is subj. because cum = since, denoting a causal

connection. Cf. Gr. 263, 5; Z. 577.

Ch. XXIV.—5. Addiderat. Pluperfect. Cf. note on turbaverant,

18, supra.

6. Proximis = amicis.

T. Novas cupiditates = novarum rerum cupiditatem.

9. Per speciem convivii. " Under pretext of an allowance for

an entertainment." Kingsley.—Quotiens .... epularetur. Imperf.

subj. denoting a repeated action. Cf. Gr. 264, 12 ; Z. 569.

10. Cohorti.... agenti. Ille mos excubiarum inter opulas ori-

giuem traxit a Claudio Imperatore. Cf. Dio. 60, 3 ; Suet. Claud. 35.

Wr.

12. Intendebat. Cf. note on it, 12.—Animosus. Literally, hearty

(from animus), hence liberal, lavish, one who spares no expense. Cf.

Freund, sub voce.

13. Speculator!. A soldier of the body-guard. The word (de­

rived from specula) properly denotes a watchman, hence used by

Tacitus for the emperor's lifeguards, who were chosen from the

praetorian bands. The word, in this sense, is post-Augustan. Cf.

Boetticher.

15. Dederit. Compare the perf. subj. here with the imperf. subj.
