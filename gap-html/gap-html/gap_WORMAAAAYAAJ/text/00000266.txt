27 his mother's (Scrjfconia) side. Al. Gn. for Cn., cf. note on prodigia

3, supra.

26. Sulpiciae ac Lutatiae, sc. gentis. Galba was of the Sul-

pician gens, and his mother was a grand-daughter of Q. Lutatius

Catulus.

30. Q,uiescenti. Antith. to hello adeptus = in peace. So G.

35: quiescenti, et passim.—Exemplo . . . Augusti. Cf. Ann. 1,3.

A singular fatality attended the efforts of Augustus to provide an heir

and successor, one after another of his adopted sons being taken away

by natural death or by the arts of Livia, wife of Augustus and mother

of Tiberius.

32. Nepotes. C. and L. Caesars, sons of Agrippa. Ann. 1, 3.

34« In domo, sc. sua, which is omitted to make in (lomo corres­

pond with in repullica.—Non quia .... non - non quin. This use

of quia is for the most part peculiar to late Latin authors. Cf. Z. 537.

Cicero uses non quia non rarely, usually non quod non. Cf. Tusc.

Qures. 1,11, and Kiihner's note, ibid. All these formula are followed

by the subjunctive. Cf. Z. 537; Arnold's Prose Introd. 492.

36. Judicii. My unbiased judgment in the choice of a suc­

cessor. Antithetic to ambitione. The logical connection between

the two clauses is this: I did not accept imperial power myself from

ambitious motives, and in the choice of my successor, I have been

governed, not by ambitious or selfish motives, but by sober and un­

biased judgment (justis causis et vera aestimatione. Ernesti).

37. ]Vecessitudines = propinqui.

3g 1. Ea = such. Hence followed by the subj. Cf. Gr. 264; Z

556.

2. Praeteritum is not superfluous, but prepares the way for the

subsequent exhortation to lead a similar life in future.

age of Tacitus. Cf. Boetticher.—Fortunam .... adversam. Patre,

matre, fratre a Claudio interfectis, fratre altera caeso a Nerone, et

ipse diu exsul. Brotier. Cf. 21. 47. 48 in this Book.

Ad rem. Cf. Xen. Mem. 2, 1, 20 Plin. Epis. 9,26.

8. Imminueiit, sc. tuam fidem, libertatem, etc.—Irrumpet. Sing.

Gr. 209, R. 12, (2).—Pessimum . . . venenum. In appos. with utilitas,

Wr.; with blanditiae, Rup. Or. decides in favor of the latter, and

argues, that if the former were the meaning, it would read pessimum-

que, etc.

9. Et jam = Gr. ml H Wr.
