320 NOTES.

tjn C. Praeteudere is little used in this literal and physical sense, ex

cept by the poets. Prose writers use it chiefly in the sense of to cover

or cloak.

T. Nec virorum, etc. Nec = el non, and correl. to et before pe­

cuniae. Cf. note on neque . .. . et, I, 15.—Pecuniae is gen. Gr. 213.

—Quantum .... cingitur. All the islands of the sea, i. e. the Med­

iterranean. The predicate is omitted here (as it is also in several of

the foregoing clauses), viz. were on their side.

8. Interim, sc. between the present and the time of decisive action.

Ch. VII.—11« Vlctores, etc. The reader will perceive, that

these are the considerations that influenced the Flavian leaders to

delay. The motives of men's conduct are set forth by T. with no

less distinctness aud fulness than their actions.

13. Vaceret. Subj. Cf. Gr. 265; Z. 552.

1*. Etiam egregios duces. Even illustrious comrr.tnders, still

more those, who, like Oth. and Vitel., were discordes, ignavi and

luxuriosi.

IT. Nuper. Ant. to olim, and like olim limiting mixtis consQhs.

—Mixtis consiliis, amore reipublicae, dulcedo praedarum, etc., are

the motives which influenced them, not to delay, but to watch an op­

portunity for action.—Optimus quisque, sc. stimulabantur. Cf. note

on tumultus initium, 1, 83.

19. Stimulabat is to be connected logically, not with distulcre,

but with in occasionem.—Ambiguae .... res need not be confined to

pecuniary circumstances, it may include all private occasions of dis­

comfort or danger.

writers, it is used in the same sense as quasi, and followed by the subj.

Cf. Z. 282.572; Gr. 263,2. The imperf. subj. here implies, that Nero

was not to make his appearance. Ad rem, cf. note on falsi Neronia

ludibrio, 1, 2.—Vario rumore. Cf. Xiph. 63, 27. 29 ; Suet, Ner.

48.49. Super, in the sense of de, concerning, requires the ablative.

Z. 320.

24. Ceterorum, sc. falsorum Neronum.—In contextu operis. In

the course of this work, now lost.

26. Unde .... fides. For Nero valued himself more on his

skill in music than in government. Cf. Ann. 14, 14 ; 15, 44, et al.

Propior here, as often in T., denotes tendency. The credulity of the

multitude was the more easily imposed upon, because this slave besides

resembling Nero in his looks, was also a skilful musician.
