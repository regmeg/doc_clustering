T. Majestatem, sc. laesam. Majcstas laesa or minuta was,

under tho republic, any offence against the majesty of the people 01

the state ; under the emperors, it was especially an offence against

the imperial dignity. Anglice: treason, though majeslas is more

comprehensive than treason. Cf. Smith's Die. of Antiq.; also Man.

as above. To pardon the crime of majestas was now popular; to

pardon repetundae was unpopular. Hence the senators who were

now restored to their seats were falsely alleged to have been con­

demned for the former and not the latter offence.

Cb. LXXVIII.—9. Civitatum quoque, etc. Cities md prov­

inces also, i. e. as well as Rome, to which the previous section

were Roman colonies in Spain, now Seville and Merida. The latter

was so called from a colony dj veteran soldiers (emeriti) led thither

by command of Augustus. Cf. Dio. 53, 26.

12. Baeticae. A province in the south of Spain.—Maurorum

civitates. In Mauritania, on the adjacent coast of Africa. These

towns of the Mauri were placed under the jurisdiction of the Baetican

rather than permanent gifts, because, in the political changes which

soon followed, they became null and void.

way, 7, note.

16. Statuas .... reposuit. They had been thrown down by

the populace, and replaced by Nero. Ann. 14, 61. On the death of

Cf. 4. and 16. Suet. Ner. 57.—Qui.... proponerent, i. e. in loci*

publicis injussi ponerent. Ernesti. Ad tem, cf. Plut. Otho. Ad ver-
