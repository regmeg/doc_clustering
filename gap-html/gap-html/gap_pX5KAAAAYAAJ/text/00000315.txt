eember, A. U. 790, the destestable off­

spring of two pernicious parents. He was

called simply Domitius, till by the adop­

tion of Claudius, A. U. 803, he passed into

the Claudian family, and took the name of

Nero. He began his reign, A. U. 807,

with such favourable circumstances, as, for

a time, gave promise of a virtuous prince.

His enormities, afterwards, delivered him

down to the execration of posterity. The

burning of Rome was imputed to him.

The Christian religion has to boast, that

*the foe of human kind was the enemy of  
her moral doctrine. He was a burthen to

himself, and detested by all orders of men,

He was condemned to die, more majorum,

by a decree of the senate. He escaped a

public execution, and died in a dastard­

ly manner by his own hand, A. U. 821,

A. D. 68. By his death the race of the

Caesars became extinct.—Suet. Life of Ne­
