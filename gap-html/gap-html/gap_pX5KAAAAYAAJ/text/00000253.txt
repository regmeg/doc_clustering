M storm : and what was their motive ? In appen.

B. XVI.

" those days the love of plunder was suf-

" ficient to provoke a war. We have a

** nobler cause; the cause of public liberty.  
M It is that, my friends, it is that glorious

" cause that now invites us. Let us obey

" the call, and draw the avenging sword.

" The nations round us, fired with indig-

" nation, are ready to assert their rights.

" Let them not be the first to prove them*

" selves men. The enterprise has in it all

w that is dear to man, all that is great

" in human nature; and shall we not be

" the first to seize the glorious opportu*

* nity ? Let us go forth at once, and be  
" the deliverers of the world."

This speech was received with shouts of

applause. The deputies, inflamed with

ardour in the cause of liberty, returned

to their respective cities; a warlike spirit

was kindled in the mass of the people ; a

league was formed, and the din of arms was

heard in every part of the country, Galba

was informed of all that passed. He also

knew that he was proscribed by Nero, and

that his effects were sold by public auction.
