374 ' NOTES ON THE

tune, would not, among a great number of daring con­

spirators, be deemed an object worthy of notice ; and,

If Nero framed the story, is it probable that a writer,

who wages an incessant war against evil men and evil

deeds, would have descended to be the accomplice of a

tyrant ? Tacitus, through the whole of his narrative, has
