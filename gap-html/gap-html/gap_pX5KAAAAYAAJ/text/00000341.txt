GENEALOGICAL TABLE. 333

Tiberius the emperor was his elder brother.

He was born A. U. 716. A youth, says

Velleius Paterculus, of as many virtues as

prudence can acquire, or human nature

can admit. The fine ode of Horace, Qua-

km Ministrum fulminis alitem, book iv.

ode 4, written in the year of Rome 743,

displays his military character in the

brightest colours. He rose to the highest

civil offices, such as praetor, aedile, and

consul. He commanded the Roman army

in Germany, and for his victories obtained

the name of Germanicus. He was fa-.

ther of the famous Germanicus by An-

tonia the younger (see No. 42). He died

A. U. 745; the pride of the Claudian fa­

mily, and the favourite of the Roman

people. Augustus spoke his funeral pane­

gyric, and in his speech offered up a fer­

vent prayer to the gods, that all future

Caesars might resemble him, and that his

own death, whenever it should happen,

might be equally honourable and as sin­

cerely lamented.—Suet. Life of Claudius,
