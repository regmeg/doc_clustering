OF TACITUS. IO9

Seneca lingered in pain. The approach book

of death was slow, and he wished for his

dissolution. Fatigued with pain, worn out

and exhausted, he requested his friend,

Statius Annaeus, whose fidelity and medical

skill he had often experienced, to administer

a draught of that swift-speeding poison (a),

usually given at Athens to the criminals

adjudged to death. He swallowed the

potion, but without any immediate effect.

His limbs were chilled: the vessels of his

body were closed, and the ingredients,

though keen and subtle, could not arrest

the principles of life. He desired to be

placed in a warm bath. Being conveyed

according to his desire, he sprinkled his

slaves with the water, and " Thus," he said,

** I MAKE LIBATION TO JuPITER THE

" deliverer." The vapour soon over­

powered him, and he breathed his last. His

body, without any funeral pomp, was com­

mitted to the flames. He had given di­

rections for that purpose in his last will,

made at a time when he was in the-zenith

of power, and even then looked forward to

the close of his days.
