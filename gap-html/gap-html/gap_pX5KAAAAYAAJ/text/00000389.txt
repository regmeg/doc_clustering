Section VI.

(a) Suetonius says, he married Poppsea twelve days

after his divorce from Octavia, and, notwithstanding the

vehemence of his love, killed her with a kick when she

was big with child, only because she took the liberty to

Rome in that early period. The custom of burning the

dead was held in abhorrence by several nations, and, ac­
