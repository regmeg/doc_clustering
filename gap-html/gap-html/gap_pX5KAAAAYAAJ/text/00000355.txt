GENEALOGICAL TABLE. 347

among the gods. His deification was

treated with contempt and ridicule by Se­

neca, in a tract still extant, entitled, Clau-

dii Casari Apocololcintosis. The general

design of the piece is not ill imagined; but

the humour is often coarse, and, upon the

whole, inferior to what might have been

expected from the lively genius of that en­

tertaining writer. Claudius, with all the

appearance of inert faculties and an im­

passive mind, devoted his time, in repose

and indolence, to literature and the polite

arts. He was not entirely void of taste.

His compositions in Greek, as well as La­

tin, were written with purity and even ele­

gance. Two pieces of a brass table have

been found at Lyons, on which is engrav­

ed a speech of Claudius, in characters so

plainly legible, that Dotteville (in his edi­

tion of Tacitus) has given an exact copy,

-faithfully compared with the original (see  
at the end of his Notes to Annals, book

xii.).—Suet. Life of Claudius, s. 2, 10,41,
