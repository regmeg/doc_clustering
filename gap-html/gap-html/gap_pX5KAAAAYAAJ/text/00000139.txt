board. Rome, in the mean time, was dis足

tracted with hope and fear, with doubt

and expectation. No other subject was

talked of. The common people, with their

usual facility, believed every thing; while

men of reflection argued in a different

manner. It happened that the quinquen足

nial games (a) were to close the second

lustre of five years. During that festival, the

expected treasure was the subject on which

the orators expatiated, and the poets ex足

hausted their invention. In their flights

of fancy, the earth was no longer content

with pouring forth fruit and grain, and pro足

ducing metals intermixed with veins of

precious ore; the present fecundity shewed

that the gods were working miracles to

bless the reign of Nero. These were the

bright conceits, which flattery displayed

with rapture, and eloquence adorned with

her richest colouring. While the passions

of Nero stood ready to receive every new

device, fiction passed for truth, and nothing

was too hyperbolical for the credulity of

the prince.
