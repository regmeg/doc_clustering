SIXTEENTH BOOK OF THE ANNALS. 389

Section XXXII.

{a) Egnatius, the professor of the stoic philosophy,

who appears as a witness against Bareas Soranus, is men­

tioned by Juvenal:

Stoicus occidit Baream, delator amicum,

Discipulumque senex. Sat. iii. ver. lift.

See the History, book iv. s. 10.

Section XXXIV.

(a) Notice has been taken, s. xxvii. note (a), of the

imperial quaestors. The consuls also had their quaestors,

as we read in Dio, lib. xlviii. where it is said that Appius

Claudius and Caius Norbanus, consuls A. U. C. 716,

had each of them two quaestors under their own imme­

diate direction.

(b) Demetrius is praised by Seneca, not merely as a

philosopher, but as a man of consummate virtue. De

Beneficiis, lib. vii. cap. 8. In another place he calls him

emphatically, not the teacher, but the witness of truth.

Non praceptor veri, sed testis. Epist. xx.

(c) Arria, his wife, was the daughter of the cele­

brated Arria, who, in the reign of Claudius, A. U. C.

195, plunged a dagger in her own breast, to give her

husband Caecina Paetus an example of undaunted courage. .

See the Life of Agricola, s. ii. notes (a) and (b).
