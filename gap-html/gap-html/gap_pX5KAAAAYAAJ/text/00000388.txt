380 NOTES ON THE

Section IV.

(a) Nero did not scruple to appear upon the stage

amongst other performers, even in the spectacles pre­

sented by the magistrates. He sung tragedies masked,

the vizors of the gods and goddesses being formed into a

resemblance of his own face. Among the rest, he acted

Canacein Labour, Orestes the Murderer of his Mother,

(Edipus blinded, and Hercules mad. In the last tragedy

a soldier, at his post in the theatre, seeing the emperor

bound with chains as the play required, ran to his assist­

ance. Suet, in Neron. s. 21. See also the same,'s. 22,

23 and 24. This ridiculous display of talents, beneath

the dignity of a prince, is well described by Racine in his

play of Britannicus:

Pour toute ambition, pour vertu singuliere,

II excelle a conduire un char dans la carriere ;

A disputer des prix indignes de ses mains,

A se donner lui-meme en spectacle aux Romains j

A venir prodiguer sa voix sur un theatre,

A reciter des chants qu'il veut qu'on idolatre.

Act. iv. scene 4.

Racine's play was performed before Lewis XIV, who had

before that time mixed in the dance on the public stage.

The picture of Nero's folly made the monarch see himself,

and from that time he resolved never to degrade the royal

character.

(a) See Suetonius in Neron. s. 23.
