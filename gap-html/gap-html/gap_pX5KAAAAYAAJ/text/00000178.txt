THE ANNALS

Arulenus Rusticus (a) assisted at this

consultation. He was, at that time, a tri足

bune of the people; a young man of sen足

timent, eager to be in action, and warm

with the love of glory. He offered to in足

terpose, by his tribunitian authority, to

prevent a decree of the senate. " For-

" bear," said Thrasea, " and learn, young

" man, to restrain this impetuous ar-

" dour. By a rash opposition you cannot

" save your friend, and you may bring

" down ruin on yourself. For me, I have

" lived my days; my course is well nigh

" finished; it now remains, that I reach

" the goal with undiminished honour. As

" to you, my friend, you have but lately

" entered the career of civil dignities. Life

" is before you, and you have not as yet

" pledged yourself to the public. Ere you

" take a decided part, it will behove you

" to consider well the times upon which

" you are fallen, and the principles which

4* you mean to avow." Having thus de足

clared his sentiments, he gave no opinion

concerning the propriety of appearing in

the senate, but reserved the question for

his own private meditation.
