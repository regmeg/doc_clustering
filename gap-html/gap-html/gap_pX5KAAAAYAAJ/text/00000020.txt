10 THE ANNALS

*££K Bolanus: In their private instructions those  
officers had it in command, to proceed with

caution, and act on the defensive, without

pushing on their operations with too much

vigour^ A decisive campaign was not

Corbulo's plan. He wished to protract the

war, and, in the mean time, stated, in his

letters to the emperor, the necessity of ap­

pointing a commander, with a special com­

mission to protect Armenia, as he foresaw

a storm gathering in the province of Syria.

If Vologeses made an irruption in that

quarter, a powerful army would be wanted

to repel the invader. With the rest of his

legions he formed a chain of posts along

the banks of the Euphrates, and, having

made a powerful levy of provincial forces,

he secured all the passes against the in­

roads of the enemy. In order to make

sure of water in a country not well sup­

plied by nature, he erected strong castles

near the springs and fountains; and, where

the stations were inconvenient, he choaked

up a number of rivulets with heaps of sand,

with intent to conceal their source from th^

Parthian army.
