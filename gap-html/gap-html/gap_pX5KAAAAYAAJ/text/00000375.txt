The public notaries and aruspex wait;

The genial bed is in the garden drest;

The portion paid, and every rite exprest,

Which in a Roman marriage is profest

Section XXXVIII.

(a) Suetonius relates the fire of Rome, and has no

doubt of Nero's guilt. He tells us, that somebody re­

peating in conversation,

'Ejioa 8a.wrof yoiia. fu%!)iijna -itvt),

When I am dead let fire devour the world;

Let it be, said Nero, whilst I am living, epa gujvrc;.

And accordingly, pretending to dislike the old buildings,

and the narrow winding of the streets, he set fire to the

city in so barefaced a manner, that several men of con­

sular rank met Nero's domestic servants with torches and

combustibles, but did not dare to apprehend them. Suet,

in Neron. s. 38. See Dio, lib. lxii.

(b) Livy observes, that, after the city was fired by the

Gauls, it was rebuilt in close, narrow, winding streets.

See Livy, lib. v. s. 55.
