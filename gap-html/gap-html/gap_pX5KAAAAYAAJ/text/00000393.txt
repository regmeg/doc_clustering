(a) This description of Nero and his flagitious court

has been supposed by some critics to be the work called

Pctronii Arbitri Satyricon; but this, it is evident, must

be a gross mistake. The Sutijricon is a long work, and

must have been written at leisure. It contains nothing

to be ranked with the critics of antiquity, find a place in

the narrative of a dying man ?
