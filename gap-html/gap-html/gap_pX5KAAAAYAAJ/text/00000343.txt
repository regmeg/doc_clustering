manners, mild and gracious to all, he was

beheld with pleasure, and heard with ap­

plause. Ambition, if we except the fair

desire of being distinguished by his virtues,

had no influence on his conduct. Unde-

bauched by pleasure, he discharged all the

duties of an upright citizen and an able

officer. He commanded the Roman le­

gions in Germany ; in war victorious, and

in peace moderate to the vanquished. Pos­

from the vices of that warlike chief. He

was on the side of virtue greatly his supe­

rior. Rome deplored his death, and with

him lost all hopes of seeing the old consti­

tution restored. Foreign nations paid their

tribute of respect to his memory.—Tacit.
