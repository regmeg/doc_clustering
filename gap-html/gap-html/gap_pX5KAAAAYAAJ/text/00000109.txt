OF TACITUS. .99

" Let your friends," they said, " assemble book

cause, and they will be joined by num- sis. *

" bers. The fame of an impending revo-

" lution would excite a general spirit; and

" fame in great undertakings has been often

" known to decide the event. Nero will

" be taken by surprise; on his part no

" measures are concerted. In sudden

" commotions the bravest are often struck

" with terror; and if courage may be thus

" overpowered, what will be the case of a

'* theatrical emperor, a scenic performer, a

" vile comedian, assisted by Tigellinus and

" his band of harlots ? In all great enter-

" prises the attempt appears impracticable

" to little minds; but the brave and valiant

" know that to dare is to conquer. In a

" plot, in which numbers were embarked,

" the silence of all could not be expected.

" The mind will waver, and the body will

" shrink from pain. There is no secret so

" deeply laid but bribery will draw it forth,

" or cruelty can extort it. The guards in

" a short time might seize Piso himself,

" and drag him to an ignominious death.

" How much more glorious to fall bravely
