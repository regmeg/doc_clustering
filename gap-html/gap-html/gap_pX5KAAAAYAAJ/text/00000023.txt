The siege promised no kind of advant- 62-

age; Tigranes possessed a strong hold, well

garrisoned, and provided with ample sup­

plies; the forces, that attempted to storm

the works, met with a total overthrow; the

Roman legions were in possession of Ar­

menia, and others were in readiness, not

only to cover the province of Syria, but to

push the war into the Parthian territories;

)iis cavalry suffered for want of forage, and,

all vegetation being destroyed by a swarm

of locusts, neither grass nor foliage could

be found, Determined by these considera­

tions, yet disguising his fear, Vologeses,

with the specious appearance of a pacific

disposition, returned for answer to Cas-

perius, that he should send ambassadors to

Rome, with instructions to solicit the cession

^pf Armenia, and the re-establishment of

peace between the two nations. Mean­

while, he sent dispatches to Mpneses, with

orders to abandon the siege of Tjgranocerta,

and, without farther delay, returned to his

capital.
