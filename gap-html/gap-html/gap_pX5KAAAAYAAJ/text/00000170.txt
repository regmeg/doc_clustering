u voice. A magistrate formerly of unre­

al*" " mitting assiduity, he took a part in every

««.' " debate, supporting or opposing the most

" trifling motions; and now what is his

" conduct ? For three years together he

" has not so much as entered the senate (b).

" Even on a late occasion, when the busi-

" ness relating to Silanus and Vetus drew

" the fathers to a crowded meeting, Thrasea

' " was not at leisure; the affairs of his

" clients engrossed his attention, and the

" patriot was detained from the senate by

** his own petty concerns. What is this  
" but a public secession! He is at the

" head of a faction, and if his partisans

" take fire from his example, a civil war

" must be the consequence. Caesar and

" Cato were the names that formerly kept

" the world awake; at present, in a city

" ever rent by discord, Nero and Thrasea

s " engage the public mind.

** The popular demagogue has his sec-  
" taries and his followers; a set of men

" not yet, like their master, ambitiously

" sententious, but, in imitation of his mien
