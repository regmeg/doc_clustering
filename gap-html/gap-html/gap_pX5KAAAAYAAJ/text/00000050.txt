ea- The senate, before the birth, had offered

vows to the gods for the safe delivery of

Poppaea. They fulfilled their obligations,

and voted additional honours. Days of

supplication were appointed: a temple was

voted to the goddess of fecundity; athletic

sports were instituted on the model of the

religious games practised at Antium; golden

statues to the two goddesses of fortune (a)

were to be erected on the throne of Ju­

piter Capitolinus; and in honour of the

Claudian and Domitian families (li) Cir-

eensian games were to be celebrated at

Antium, in imitation of the public specta­

cles exhibited at Bovillae to commemorate

the Julian race. But these honours were

of short duration: the infant died in less

than four months, and the monuments of

human vanity faded away. But- new

modes of flattery were soon displayed: the

child was canonized for a goddess; a

temple was decreed to her, with an altar,

a bed of state, a priest, and religious cere­

monies.
