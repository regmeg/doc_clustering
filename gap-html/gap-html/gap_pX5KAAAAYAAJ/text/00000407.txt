SIXTEENTH BOOK OF THE ANNALS. 399

criticised, no mention is made of Silius Italieus. It is

therefore probable, that his work had not appeared, when

Quintilian' published his Institutes, in the reign of Domi-

tian. Silius (like Lucan before him) undertook to

make a great historical event the subject of an epic poem ;

but departing from the precedent left by Lucan, he has

interwoven with the truth too much of fable, and what

the critics call machinery. The poem, however, has

to his days by abstinence; being instructed in the stoic

school, and by the practice of the age, that suicide was

strong enough to inform the stoic school, that the life

into which we are called, ought to be preserved during

the pleasure of the Supreme Being that gave it. Pliny

the consul gives an account of the death of Silius Italieus.

Towards the end of a long life, he had contracted an

incurable disease, and therefore resolved to close the

scene. He had practised at the bar in the beginning of

life, and, in Nero's time, incurred the disgrace of being

a voluntary accuser. Leeserat farnam suam sub Nerone;

credebatur sponte aecusasse. But he afterwards, in a

more retired life, retrieved his reputqtion. Maculam
