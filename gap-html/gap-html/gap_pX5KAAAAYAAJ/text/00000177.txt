of Thrasea to rescue from infamy that

august assembly, which his presence had

so long adorned. If he did not attend

the meeting, the part, which, after hear­

fathers might have acted, will remain

problematical; and by that uncertainty

the honour of the senate may be saved.

To hope that Nero would blush for hi*

crimes, were to misunderstand his cha­

racter. His unrelenting cruelty would

most probably fall on Thrasea's wife, on

his whole family, and all that were dear

to him. For these reasons, an eminent

citizen, who had ever supported the ho­

nour of his name, and still flourished

with unblemished integrity, would do

well to remember who were the teachers

of wisdom, that furnished the principles

' and the model of his conduct. Since he

had crowded into his life all their virtues,

' it would become him to emulate their

* glory in his fall."
