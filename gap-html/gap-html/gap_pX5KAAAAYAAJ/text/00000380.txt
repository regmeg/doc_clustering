372 NOTES ON THE

Tacitus calls a pernicious superstition. Pliny adds, in

the same letter, that, in order to come at the real truth,

he ordered two female slaves to be put to the torture, but

he could discover nothing more than a rooted and ex足

cessive superstition. Trajan, in his answer to this letter,

determines, that if Christians are brought before the

governor, and proved to be guilty, they must be punished,

unless they renounce their errors, and invoke the gods of

Rome. In that case they were to be pardoned, notwith足

standing any former suspicion. But the emperor says to

his minister, " I would not have you officiously enter into

" any enquiries concerning them." Pliny's letter, Mr.

Melmoth observes, is esteemed as almost the only ge足

nuine monument of ecclesiastical antiquity, relating to

the times immediately succeeding the apostles, being

wrote not above forty years after the death of Paul. It

was preserved by the Christians themselves, as a clear'

and unsuspicious evidence of the purity of their doctrines.

It is therefore with good reason, says Brotier, that'Ter-

tullian, in a strain-of exultation, declares, That the Christ*

ians, " for their innocence, their probity, justice, truth,

" and for the living God, were burnt alive. The cruelty,

" ye persecutors !. is all your own ; the glory is ours."

Pro tantd innocentid, pro tantd probitate, pro justitid,

pro virtute, pro Deo vivo cremamur: Crudelitas pcstra;

gloria est nostra.

(d) The Jews, as will be seen in the History, book v.

s. 5, were charged with harbouring a sullen" aversion to足

wards all mankind. It is unnecessary to vindicate die

Christian religion from that imputation.

fej Juvenal alludes, with his usual indignation, to the

barbarous cruelties described by Tacitus. See sat. i.

ver. 155.
