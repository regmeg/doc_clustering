(b) For Gallio, the brother of Seneca, see Annals, xv.

8.73.

(c) Brotier exclaims in this place, let the detractors

from the merit of Lucan hear what Tacitus says of him,

and let them blush for their malignity. That a young

poet, who ended his career in the 27th year of his age,

should aim in many passages of his work at ambitious

ornaments, and the false glitter which the example of his

uncle Seneca and the taste of the age encouraged, can­

not be matter of wonder ; but, to atone for his faults,

his poem is a treasure of sentiments worthy of a Roman.

Lucan taught Corneille to think, and to express his

thoughts with force and dignity.

(d) Juvenal gives us to understand that Lucan was

possessed of great riches, and might therefore seek no re­

ward but fame:

Contentus fama jaceat Lucanus in hortis

Marmoreis. Sat. vii. ver. 79.

(e) The plot to which Tacitus refers, is not related

with perspicuity by any historian. All that is now known

is, that Cerealis was the informer, and that Sextus Passie-

nus, the chief of the conspiracy, with several men of

rank, was put to death by ordc of Caligula.

Section XVIII.

(a) This is the writer whom Pope has celebrated in

the Essay on Criticism:

Fancy and art in gay Petronius please,

The scholar's learning, with the courtier's ease.

The account here given of him by Tacitus, is elegant

and interesting. See Plutarch, on the difference between

a friend and a sycophant; and see Pliny, lib. xxxvii. s. 7^
