relations whom they could not save, em­

braced a voluntary death, and perished in

the flames. During the whole of this dis­

mal scene no man dared to attempt any

thing that might check the violence of the

dreadful calamity. A crew of incendiaries

stood near at hand denouncing vengeance

on all who offered to interfere. Some were

so abandoned as to heap fuel on the flames.

They threw in firebrands and flaming

torches, proclaiming aloud, that they had

authority for what they did. Whether, in

fact, they had received such horrible or­

ders, or, under that device, meant to plun­

der with greater licentiousness, cannot now

be known.

XXXIX. During the whole of this

terrible conflagration Nero remained at

Antium, without a thought of returning to

the city, till the fire approached the build­

ing by which he had communicated the

gardens of Maecenas (a) with the imperial

palace. All help, however, was too late.

The palace, the contiguous edifices, and

every house adjoining, were laid in ruins.
