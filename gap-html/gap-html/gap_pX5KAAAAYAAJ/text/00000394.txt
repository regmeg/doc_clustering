386 NOTES ON THE

Caesar. In process of time, to swear on the Acts of the

Emperors grew into use ; though we have seen Tiberius

refusing to admit that form of oath.

(b) Thrasea was forbid the presence of the emperor,

A. U. C. 816. See book xt. s. 23. From that time it

does not appear that he entered the senate.

(e) The Journals of the Roman people, called in the

original Diurna Populi Romaiii. These were the Ro足

man newspapers. It is to be regretted that no collection

of those fugitive pieces has come down to us. We

should have the pleasure of seeing minutely and distinctly'

the private life of the Romans, and the opportunity would

be fair to make a comparison between a Roman journalist

and the doer of a modern newspaper. ,

(d) Cicero, in the Oration for Mursena, gives a sketch

of Tubero's character: " He was a man of illustrious

" birth, a scholar, and a professor of the stoic philosophy.

" Being desired, at the funeral of Scipio Africanus, to

** lay out the couches for the farewel supper, he chose  
" the vilest sort, such as were used at Carthage, and,

" having covered them with goat skins, arranged in pro-

" per order a number of Samian vases, which were

" earthen ware ; as if he were preparing for the funeral

" of Diogenes the cynic, and not for that of the divine

" Africanus, to whose honour Quintus Maximus, in a

" panegyric from the rostrum, said, he thanked the im-

", mortal Gods that such a man was born a Roman citi-

M zen ; for wherever Scipio lived, there by consequence^

" would be fixed the empire of the world." Cicero

adds, that Tubero, a good and upright citizen, the grand足

son of Paulus jEmilius, and nephew to the deceased

Scipio, gave umbrage to the people by his perverse wis足

dom, and for his goat skins lost his election when candi足

date for the prajtorship. Atqice Hie, homo erudiiissmus.
