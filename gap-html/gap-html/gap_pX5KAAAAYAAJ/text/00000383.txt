FIFTEENTH BOOK OF THE ANNALS. 375

done ample justice to all who died with glory; to Epi-

charis, the enfranchised slave, who displayed her con­

stancy, in defiance of the keenest torture; to Seneca,

■who left an example of unshaken virtue ; to Subrius

Flavius, whose last words to Nero were, " I hated you

" when you became a coachman, a comedian, and an

" incendiary," to Sulpicius Asper, the centurion; and,

above all, to Lucan himself, who died with undaunted

courage, repeating a passage from his own poem. Let

it also be remembered, that when Lucan's father suffered

death in the following year, Tacitus says, that the son

reflected the highest honour on the father; grande adju-

onentum claritudinis. The writer who has treated Lucan

with so much candour, would neither adopt noi* invent a

calumny, to brand his name in the page of history. But

to conclude this long note : It is by no means probable,

that Tacitus, who wrote in the reign of Trajan, not

much more than thirty years after the death of Lucan,

■would hazard a glaring falsehood in the face of his con­

temporaries ; and it is less probable, that Mr. Hayley, at

the distance of more than n 30 years, should be better

informed than the great historian, who lived at the very

time of the transaction. See Poems, by William Hayley,

Esq. vol. iii. p. 206.
