THE I.IFE OF FLAVIUS JOSEFHUS. £07

for when I was satisfied of the advantage that his horse wouM

have if we came down into the plain, while we were all foot­

men, I resolved to join battle with the enemy where I was.

Now Ebutius and his party made a courageous opposition for

some time ; but when he saw that his horse were useless to him

in that place, he retired back to the city Gibea, having lost three

of his men in the fight. So I followed him directly with twa

thousand armed men ; and when I was at the city Besara, that

lay in the confines of Ptolemais, but twenty furlongs from Gi-

bea, where Ebutius abode, I placed my armed men on the out­

side of the village, and gave orders that they should guard the

passes with great care, that the enemy should not disturb us, un-

till we should have carried off the corn, a great quantity of which

lay there : it belonged to Bernice the queen, and had been ga­

thered together out of the neighbouring villages into Besara : so I

loaded my camels and asses, a great number of which I had

brought along with me, and sent the corn into Galilee. When

I had done this, I offered Ebutius battle ; but when he would

not accept of the offer, for he was terrified at our readiness and

courage, I altered my route, and marched towards Neopolitanus,

because I had heard that the country about Tiberias was laid

,waste by him. This Neopolitanus was captain of a troop of

horse, and had the custody of Scythopolis intrusted to his care

by the enemy ; and when I had hindered him from doing any

farther mischief to Tiberias, I set myself to make provision for

the affairs of Galilee.

you, abode at Gischala, was informed how all things had suc­

ceeded to my mind, and that I was much in favour with those

that were under me, as also that the enemy were greatly afraid

of me, he was not pleaesd with it, as thinking my prosperity-

tended to his ruin. So he took up a bitter envy and enmity

against me ; and hoping, that if he could inflame those that

were under me to hate me, he should put an end to the prosperi­

ty I was in, he tried to persuade the inhabitants of Tiberias, and

of Sepphoris (and for those of Gabara he supposed they would

be also of the same mind with the others), which were the great­

est cities of Galilee, to revolt from their subjection to me, and to

be of his party ; and told them, that he would command them

better than I did. As for the people of Sepphoris, who belonged

to neither of us, because they had chosen to be in subjection to

the Romans, they did not comply with his proposal; and for

those of Tiberias, they did not indeed so far comply as to make a

revolt from under me, but they agreed to be his friends, while

the inhabitants of Gabara did go over to John; and it was Si-
