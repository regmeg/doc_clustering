honours which Alexander had bestowed on the Jews. But still

conflicts perpetually arose with the Grecians; and although the

governors did every day punish many of them, yet did the sedi­

tion grow worse ; but at this time especially, when there were

tumults in other places also, the disorders among them were put

into a greater flame; for when the Alexandrians had once a pub­

lic assembly, to deliberate about an ambassage they were send­

ing to Nero, a great number of Jews came flocking to the

theatre ; but',when their adversaries saw them, they immediate­

ly cried out, and called them their enemies, and said they came

as spies upon them ; upon which they rushed out, and laid vio­

lent hands upon them ; and as for the rest, they were slain as

they ran away ; but there were three men whom they caught,

and hauled them along, in order to have them burnt alive; but

all the Jews came in a body to defend them, who at first threw

stones at the Grecians, but after that they took lamps, and

rushed with violence into the theatre, and threatened that they

would burn the people to a man: and this they had soon done,

unless Tiberius Alexander, the governor' of the city, had re­

strained their passions. However, this man did not begin to

teach them wisdom by arms, but sent among them privately

some of the principal men, and thereby entreated them to be >

quiet, and not provoke the Rdman army against them; but the

seditious made a jest of the entreaties of Tiberius, and reproach­

ed him for so doing.

take them, he sent out upon them those two Romans legions that

were in the city, and together with them five thousand other

soldiers, who, by chance, were come together out of Libia, to

the ruin of the Jews. They were also permitted not only to

kill them, but to plunder them of what they had, and to set fire

to their houses. These soldiers rushed violently into that part

of the city that was called Delta, where the Jewish people lived

together, and did as they were bidden, though not without

bloodshed on their own side also; for the Jews got together, and

set those that were the best armed among them in the forefront,

and made resistance for a great while, but when once they gave

back, they were destroyed unmercifully, and this their destruc­

tion was complete, some being caught in the open field, and

others forced into their houses, which houses were first plundered

of what was in them, and then set on fire by the Romans ;

wherein no mercy was shown to the infants, and no regard had

to the aged; but they went on in the slaughter of persons of

wery age, till all the place was overflowed with blood, and fifty
