«4 AKTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS. Book XVlf.

young men to this action ; and a report being come to them that

the king was dead, this was an addition to the wise men's per­

suasions ; so, in the very middle of the day, they got upon the

place, they pulled down the eagle, and cut it into pieces with

axes, while a great number of the people were iu the temple.

And now the king's captain, upon hearing what the undertaking

was, and supposing it was a thing of a higher nature than it proved

to be, came up thither, having a great band of soldiers with

him, such as was sufficient to put a stop to the multitude of those

who pulled down what was dedicated to God : so he fell upon

them unexpectedly, and as they were upon this bold attempt, in

a foolish presumption rather than a cautious circumspection, as is

usual with the multitude, and while they were in disorder, and

incautious of what was for their advantage; so he caught no

fewer than forty of the young men, who had the courage to stay

behind when the rest ran away, together with the authors of this

bold attempt, Judas and Matthias, who thought it an ignomi->

nious thing to retire upon his approach, and led them to the

king. And when they were come to the king, and he had asked

them if they had been so bold as to pull down what he had dedi­

" that with such a virtuous courage as becomes men ; for we

" have given our assistance to those things which were dedicated

" to the majesty of God, and we have provided for what we

" and left behind him, more worthy of observation than thy

'« commands. Accordingly we will undergo death, and all sorts

" of punishment which thou canst inflict upon us, with pleasure,

" since we are conscious to ourselves that we shall die, not for

«' any unrighteous actions, but for our love to religion." And

thus they all said, and their courage was still equal to their pro­

fession, and equal to that with which they readily set about this

undertaking. And when the king had ordered them to be bound,

he sent them to Jericho, and called together the principal men

among the Jews ; and when they were come, he made them as­

semble in the theatre, and because he could not himself stand, he

lay upon a couch, and " enumerated the many labours that he

" had long endured on their account, and' his building of the

«' temple, and what a vast charge that was to him ; while the

" Asamoneans, during the hundred and twenty-five years of their

" orovernment, had not been able to perform any so great a work

" for the honour of God as that was : that he had also adorned
