418 WARS or THE JEWS* Book II.

captains under him also, and particularly by the principal in­

strument of his tyranny, whose name was Apsulom,

10. And, as 1 said, so far truly the people assisted them,

while they hoped this might afford some amendment to the se­

ditious practices; but the others were not in haste to put an

end to the war, but hoped to prosecute it with less danger, now

they had slain Manahem. It is true, that when the people

earnestly desired that they would leave off besieging the soldiers,

they'were the more earnest in pressing it forward, and this till

Metilius, who was the Roman general, sent toEleazar, and de­

sired that they would give them security to spare their lives

only, but agreed to deliver up their arms, and what else they

had with them. The others readily complied with their peti­

tion, sent to them Gorion, the son of Nicodemus, and Ananias,

the son of Sadduk, and Judas, the son of Jonathan, that they

might give them the security of their right hands, and of their

oaths; after which Metilius brought down his soldiers, which

soldiers while they were in arms, were not meddled with by

any of the seditious, nor was there any appearance of treachery ;

but as soon as, according to the articles of capitulation, they

had all laid down their shields, and their swords, and were un­

der no farther suspision of any harm, but were going away,

Eleazar's men attacked them after a violent manner, and en­

compassed them round, and slew them, while they neither de­

fended themselves, nor entreated for mercy, but only cried out

upon the breach of their articles of capitulation, and their oaths.

And thus were all these men barbarously murdered, excepting

Metilius; for when he entreated for mercy, and promised that

he would turn Jew, and be circumcised, they saved him alive,

but none else. This loss to the Romans was but light, there

being no more than a few slain out of an immense army ; but

still it appeared to be a prelude to the Jews own destruction,

while men made public lamentation when they saw that such

occasions were afforded for a war as were incurable; that the

city was all over polluted with such abominations, from which

it was but reasonable to expect some vengeance, even though

they should escape reverence from the Romans ; so that the city

was filled with sadness, and every one of the moderate men in

it were under great disturbance, as likely themselves to under­

go punishment for the wickedness of the seditious; for indeed

it so happened, that this murder was perpetrated on the Sab­

bath day, on which day the Jews have a respite from their

works on account of divine worship,
