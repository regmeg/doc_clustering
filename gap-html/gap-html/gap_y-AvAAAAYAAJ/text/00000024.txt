36 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS. Book XVII.

and acquainted with whatsoever he did, and with the circum­

stances of his affairs, proceeded to what remained, and explained

all that concerned the demonstrations and evidences of the facts.

Upon which Antipater-, in order to make his legal defence, turn,

td himself to his father, and " enlarged upon the many indie a-

" tions he had given of his good-will to him; and instanced

" in the honours that had been done him, which yet had not

'' been done, had he not deserved- them by his virtuous con-

cern about him ; for that he had made provision for every

' thing that was fit to be foreseen beforehand, as to giving him

' his wisest advice ; and whenever there was occasion for the la­

bour of his own hands, he had not grudged any such pains

for him. And that it was almost impossible that he, who had

delivered his father from so many treacherous contrivances

" laid against him, should be himself in a plot against him, and

" so lose all the reputation he had gained for his virtue, by his

" wickedness which succeeded it; and this while he had nothing

" to prohibit him, who had already appointed his successor, to en-

" therewasno likelihood that a person who had the one half of that

" king's family, were indications that he had ever managed affairs

" out of the srncerest affection to his father. And as to what he

" had done at Rome, Caesar was a witness thereto ; who yet was

'' no more to be imposed upon than God himself: of whose opi-

" nions his letters sent hither are sufficient evidence; and that it

" was not reasonable to prefer the calumnies of such as proposed

" to raise disturbances, before those letters ; the greatest part of

" which calumnies had been raised during his absence, which

" gave scope to his enemies to forge them, which they had not

" been able to do if he had been there." Moreover he shewed

the weakness of the evidence obtained by torture, which was com­

monly false; because the distress men are in under such tortures

naturally obliges them to say many things in order to please those

that govern them. He also offered himself to the torture.

while they greatly pitied Antipater, who by weeping and put­
