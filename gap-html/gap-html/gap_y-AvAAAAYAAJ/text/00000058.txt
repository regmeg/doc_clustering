Concerning a Spurious Alexander,

$ *• "W^^ ^ese affairs had been thus settled by Caesar, a

* * certain young man, by birth a Jew, but brought up  
by a Roman freed-man in the city Sidon, ingrafted himself into

the kindred of Herod, by the resemblance of his countenance,

which those that saw him attested to be that of Alexander, the

son of Herod, whom he had slain ; and this was an incitement

to him to endeavour to obtain the government; so he took to

him as an assistant, a man of his own country, (one that was

well acquainted with the affairs of the palace, bat, on other ac­

counts, an ill man, and one whose nature made him capable of

great with Herod, or had a kindness for him, joined themselves

to this man as to their king. The cause of it was this, that men

were glad of his pretences, which were seconded by the likeness

of his countenance, which made those that had been acquainted

with Alexander strongly to believe that he was no other but the

very same person, which they also confirmed to others by oath ;

• insomuch that when the report went about him that he was co­

ming to Rome, the whole multitude of the Jews that were there

went out to meet him, ascribing it to divine Providence that he'

had so unexpectedly escaped, and being very joyful on account
