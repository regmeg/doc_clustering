" came with what haste I could from Cappadocia, I expected

" to find him put to death for, his crimes long ago-, but still in

" order to make an examination with thee about my daughter,

" whom, out of regard to thee, and thy dignity, I had espoused

" to him in marriage; but now we must take counsel about

" them both; and if thy paternal affection be so great, that thou

" canst not punish thy son, who hath plotted against thee, let

'« us change our right hands, and let us succeed one to the other

" in expressing our rage upon this occasion."

2. When he had made this pompous declaration, he got He­

rod to remit of his anger, though he were in disorder, who there­

upon gave him the books which Alexander had composed to be

read by him, and as he came to every head, he considered of it,

together with Herod. So Archelaus took hence the occasion for

that stratagem which he made use of, and by degrees he had the

blame on those men whose names were in these books, and es­

pecially upon Pheroras; and when he saw that the king believed

him [to be in earnest], he said, " We must consider whether

" the joung man be not himself plotted against by such a num-

" ber of wicked wretches, and not thou plotted against by the

" young man; for I cannot see any occasion for his falling into

" so horrid a crime, since he enjoys the advantages of royalty

" already, and has the expectation of being one of thy succes-

" sors; I mean this unless there were some persons that per,

" suade him to it, and such persons as make an ill use of the fa-

*' cility they know there is to persuade young men; for by such  
" persons, not only young men are sometimes imposed upon,

" but old men also, and by them sometimes are the most illus-

" trious families and kingdoms overturued."

3. Herod assented to what he had said, and, by degrees, abated

of his anger against Alexander; but was more angry at Phero­

ras; for the principal subject of the four books was Pheroras,

who perceiving that the king's inclinations changed on a sudden,

and that Archelaus's friendship could do every thing with him,

and that he had no honourable method of preserving himself, he

procured his safety by his impudence. So he left Alexander,

and had recourse to Archelaus, who told him, That " he did not

" see how he could get him excused, now he was directly caught

" in so many crimes, whereby it was evidently demonstrated

" that he had plotted against the king, and had been the cause of

" those misfortunes which the young man was now under, un-

" less he would moreover leave off his cunning knavery, and

" his denials of what he was charged withal, and confess the

" charge, and implore pardon of'his brother, who still had a

" kindness
