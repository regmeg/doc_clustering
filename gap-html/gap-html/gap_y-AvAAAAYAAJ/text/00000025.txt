Chap. V. ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS; 17

ting on a countenance suitable to his sad case, made them cotn-

tniserate the same ; insomuch that his very enemies were mc^

ved to compassion ; and it appeared plainly that Herod himself

was affected in his own mind, although he was not willing it

should be taken notice of. Then did Nicolaus begin to proseÂ­

cute what the king had begun, and that with great bitterness ;

and summed up all the evidence which arose from the tortures,

or from the testimonies. " He principally and largely cried up

" the king's virtues, which he had exhibited in the maintenance

" and education of his sons ; while he never could gain any ad-

" vantage thereby, but still fell from one misfortune to another;

" Although he owned that he was not so much surprised with

" that thoughtless behaviour of his former sons, who were but

" young, and were besides corrupted by wicked counsellors;

'' who were the occasion of their wiping out of their minds the

'' righteous dictates of nature, and this out of a desire of coming

'' to the government sooner than they ought to do ; yet that he

" could not but justly stand amazed at the horrid wickedness of

" Antipater, who, although he had not only had great benefits

" bestowed on him by his father, enough to tame his reason, yet

'' could not be more tamed than the most envenomed serpents ;

'' whereas even those creatures admit of some mitigation, and

'' will not bite their benefactors, while Antipater hath not let

'' the misfortunes of his brethren be any hindrance to him, but

" he hath gone on to imitate their barbarity notwithstanding.

'' Yet wast thou, O Antipater ! (as thou hast thyself confessed),

" the informer as to what wicked actions they had done, and the

" searcher out of the evidence against them, and the author of

'' the punishment they underwent upon their detection. Nor

'' do we say this as accusing thee for being so zealous in thy an-

'' ger against them, but are astonished at thy endeavours to imi-

" tate their profligate behaviour ; and we discover thereby, that

" thou didst not act thus for the safety of thy father, but for the

" destructioa of thy brethren, that by such outside hatred of their

'' impiety, thou mightest be believed a lover of thy father, and

" mightest thereby get thee power enough to do mischief with

'' the greatest impunity ; which design thy actions indeed demon-

" strate. It is true, thou tookest thy brethren off, because thou

" didst convict them of their wicked designs ; but thou didst not

"yield up to justice those who were.their partners ; and there-

" by didst make it evident to all men, that thou madest a cove-

" nant with them against thy father, when thou chosest to be

" the accuser of thy brethren, as desirous to gain to thyself alone

" this advantage of laying plots to kill thy father; and so to en-
