190 'ANTIQUITIES or THE JEWS* Book XX.

vered down to us from the original creation of man, until the

twelfth year of the reign of Nero, as to what hath befallen

the Jews, as well in Egypt as in Syria, and in Palestine, and

what we have suffered from the Assyrians and Babylonians,

and what afflictions the Persians and Macedonians, and after

them the Romans, have brought upon us ; for I think I may

say that I have composed this history with sufficient accuracy

in all things. I have attempted to enumerate those high-priests

that we have had during the interval of two thousand years : I

have also carried down the succession of our kings, and related

their actions, and political administration, without [considerable]

errors, as also the power of our monarchs ; and all according to

what is written in our sacred books ; for this it was that I pro­

mised to do in the beginning of this history. And I am so bold

as to say, now I have so completely perfected the work I pro­

posed to myself to do, that no other person, whether he were a

Jew or a foreigner, had he ever so great an inclination to it,

could so accurately deliver these accounts to the Greeks as is

done in these books. For those of my own nation freely ac­

knowledge, that I far exceed them in the learning belonging to

Jews ; I have also taken a great deal of pains to obtain the learn­

ing of the Greeks, and understand the elements of the Greek lan­

guage, although I have so long accustomed myself to speak our

own tongue, that I cannot pronounce Greek with sufficient exact­

ness ; for our nation does not encourage those that learn the lan­

guages of many nations, and so adorn their discourses with the

smoothness of their periods ; because they look upon this sort of

accomplishment as common, not only to all sorts of free-men, but

to as many of the servants as please to learn them. But they

give him the testimony of being a wise man,who isfullvacquaint-

ed with our laws, and is able to interpret their meaning ; on

which account, as there have been many who have done their en­

deavours with great patience to obtain this learning, there have

yet hardly been so many as two or three that have succeeded

therein, who were immediately well rewarded for their pains.

And now it will not be perhaps an invidious thing-, if I treat

briefly of my own family, and of the actions of my own life,

while there is still living such as can either prove what 1 say to

be false, or can attest that it is true ; with which accounts I shall

put an end to these Antiquities, which are contained in twenty

books and sixty thousand verses. And if God * permit me, I
