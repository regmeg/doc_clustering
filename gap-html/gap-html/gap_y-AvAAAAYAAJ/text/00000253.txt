THE

WARS OF THE JEWS,

OR,

THE HISTORY

OF THE

DESTRUCTION OF JERUSALEM.

PREFACE.

$ 1. * "V1T HEREAS the war which the Jews made with the

' Romans hath been the greatest of all those, not only

that have been in our times, but, in a manner, of those that

ever were heard of; both of those wherein cities have fought

against cities, or nations against nations; while some men who

were not concerned in the affairs themselves, have gotten toge­

ther vain and contradictory stories by hearsay, and have written

them down after a sophistical manner; and while those that were

there present have given false accounts of things, and this either

out of a humour of flattery to the Romans, or of hatred towards

the Jews; and while their writings contain sometimes accusa­

tions, and sometimes encomiums, but no where the accurate truth

of the facts ; I have proposed to myself, for the sake of such as

live under the government of the Romans, to translate those

books into the Greek tongue, which I formerly composed in the

language

* I have already observed more than once, that this history of the Jewish war

wai Josephus's first work, and published about A.D. 75. when he was but 38

years of age; and that when he wrote it, he was not thoroughly acquainted with

several circumstances of history from the days of Antiochus Epiphanes, with

,vrhich it begins, till near his own times, contained in the first and former
part

of the second book, and so committed many involuntary errors therein. That

he published his Antiquities 18 years afterward, perused those most authentic

histories, the first book of Maccabees, in the rjth year of Domitian, A.D. 93,

"when he was much more completely acquainted with those ancient times, and

"after he had wrote the Chronicles of the Priesthood of John Hyrcanus, &c.—

That accordingly he then reviewed those parts of this work, and gave the pub.

,Jic a more faithful, complete, and accurate account of the facts therein
related ;

aui'd honestly corrected the errors he had before run into.
