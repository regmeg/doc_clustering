WARS OF THE JEWS. Book f,

with great alacrity to fight them, and it came to a close fight'.

Now other parts of their army made resistance for a while; but

Herod running the utmost hazard out of the rage he was in at

the murder of his brother, that he might be avenged on those

that had been the authors of it, soon beat those that opposed him,

and, after he had beUen them, he alwavs turned his force against

those that stood to it still, and pursued them all; so that a great

slaughter was made, while some were forced back into that vil­

lage whence they came out; he also pressed hard upon the hin-

dermost, and slew a vast number of them; he also fell into the

village with the enemy, where every house was filled with arm­

ed men, and the upper rooms were crowded above with soldiers

for their defence; and when he had beaten those that were oa

the outside, he pulled the houses to pieces, and plucked out

those that were within; upon many he had the roofs shaken

down, whereby they perished by heaps, and as for those that fled

out of the ruins, the soldiers received them with their swords

in their hands, and the multitude of those slain, and lying on

heaps was so great that the conquerors could not pass along the

roads. Now the enemy could not bear this blow, so that when

that lay in the way of this his entire glorious progress, and was

what hindered Antigonus from being now conquered, who was

already disposed to forsake the city.

1. Now when at the evening Herod had already dismissed

his friends to refresh themselves after their fatigue, and when

he was gone himself, while he was still hot in his armour, like

a common soldier to bathe himself, and had but one servant

that attended him, and before he was gotten into the bath, one

of the enemies met him in the face with a sword in his hand,

and then a second, and then a third, and after that more of them ;

these weremenwhohad run away out of the battle into the bath

in their armour, and they had lain there for some time in great

terror, and in privacy, and when they saw the king, they trem­

bled for fear, and ran by him in a fright, although he. were na­

ked, and endeavoured to get oft'into the public road; now there

was by chance nobody else at hand that might seize upon these

men, and for Herod, he was contented to have come to no harm

himself, so that they all got away in safety.

S. But on the next day Herod had Pappus's head cut off, who

was the general for Antigonus, and was slain in the battle, and
