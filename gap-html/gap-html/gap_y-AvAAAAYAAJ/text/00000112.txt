go into a foreign land ; agreeably to which custom of theirs she

carried her idols with her. Now, at first she performed her

worship to them privately, but when she was become Anileus's

married wife, she worshipped them in her accustomed manner,'

and with the same appointed ceremonies which she used in her

former husband's days ; upon which their most esteemed friends

blamed him at first, that he did not act after the manner of the

Hebrews, nor perform what was agreeable to their laws, in mar­

rying a foreign wife, and one that transgressed the accurate ap­

pointments of their sacrifices and religious ceremonies ; that he

ought to consider, lest by allowing himself in many pleasures of

the body, he might lose his principality, on account of the beau­

ty of a wife, and that high authority which, by God's blessing,

he had arrived at. But, when they prevailed not at all upon'

him, he slew one of them for whom he had the greatest respect,

because of the liberty he took with him ; who, when he was

dying, out of regard to the laws, imprecated a punishment up­

loudly complained of Anileus, and told him, that " it had been

" well that he had of himself seen what was advantageous to them,

" but that however it was now high time to correct what had

" been done amiss, before the crime thathad been committed pro-

' ved the ruin of himself and all the rest of'them. They added,

' that the marriage of this woman was made without their con-

' worship which this woman [paid to their gods] was a reproach

sible of his brother's offence, that it had been already the cause

of great mischiefs, ajid would be so for the time to come ; yet

did he tolerate the same from the good-will he had to so near a

relation, and forgiving it to him, on account that his brother was

quite over-borne by his wicked inclinations. But as more and

more still came about him every day, and the clamours about it

became greater, he at length spake to Anileus about these cla-
