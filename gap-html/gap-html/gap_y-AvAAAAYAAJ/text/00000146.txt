" the senate, which consisted of so great a number : that he ought

" to let the law take place in the disposal of all that related to

" the public order, and to remember how greatly the former ty-

* rants had afflicted their eity ; and what dangers both he and  
" they had escaped under Caius ; and that he ought not to hate

" while he did himself wilfully treat his country after a mad and
