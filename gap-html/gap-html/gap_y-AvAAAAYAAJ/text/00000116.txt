dangers, and very ready to fight upon any occasion. Now, when

the Greeks had the worst in this sedition, and saw that they had

but one way of recovering their former authority, and that was,

if they could prevent the agreement between the Jews and the

Syrians, they every one discoursed with such of the Syrians as

were formerly their acquaintance, and promised they would be

at peace and friendship with them. Accordingly, they gladly

agreed so to do; and xvhen this was done by the principal men of

both nations, they soon agreed to a reconciliation, and when they

were so agreed, they both knew that the great design of such their

union, would be their common hatred to the Jews. According­

ly they fell upon them, and slew about fifty thousand of them ;

nay, the Jews were all destroyed, excepting a few who escaped,

either by the compassion which their friends or neighbours af­

forded them, in order to let them fly away. These retired to

Ctesiphon, a Grecian city, and situated aear to Seleucia, where

the king [of Parthia] lives in winter every year, and where the

greatest part of his riches are reposited ; but the Jews had here.

no certain settlement, those of Seleucia having little concern for

the king's honour. Now the whole nation of the Jews were in

fear both of the Babylonians, and of the Seleucians, because all

the Syrians that live in those places agreed with the Seleucians

in the war against the Jews ; so the most of them gathered them­

selves together, and went to Neerda, and Nisibis, and obtained

security there by the strength of those cities ; besides which

their inhabitants, who were a ijreat many, were all warlike men.

And this was the state of the Jews at this time in Babylonia.
