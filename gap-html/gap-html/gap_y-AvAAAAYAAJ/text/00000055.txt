" human manner; because it was not a smaller pleasure to the

* sufferers to have such things concealed, than it would have

" this which Herod had brought upon their nation ; that it was.

" for this reason, that they thought they might justly and gladly

" salute Archelaus as king, upon this supposition, that whoso.

'' ever should be set over their kingdom, he would appear more

" mild to them than Herod had been ; and that they had joined

the days of Herod, and that to such a degree, that the nation now at last seem

sorely to repent of such their ancient choice, in opposition to God's better
choice

for them, and had much rather be subject to even a Pagan Roman government,

and their deputies, than to be any longer under the oppression of the family
of

Herod; which request of theirs Augustus did not now grant them, bnt did it for

the one-half of that nation in a few years afterward, upon fresh complaints

made by the Jews against Archelaus, who, under the more humble name of aii

eihnarch, which Augustus only would now allow him, soon took upon him the

insolence and tyranny of his father king Herod, as the remaining part of thi*
