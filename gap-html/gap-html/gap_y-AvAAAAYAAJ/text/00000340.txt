" kingdom of their ancestors to that pestilent fellow AntirSater:

" that he would now appease the ghosts of Hyrcanus and Ma.

" riamne, by taking vengeance on him; for that it was not fit

" for him to take the succession to the government from such a

" fatherwithout bloodshed: thatmany tilings happen every day to

" provoke him so todo, insomuch that hecan say nothingat all, but

" it affords occasion tor calumny against him; for that,ifanymen-

" tiou be made of nobility of birth, even in other cases, he is a-

" bused unjustly, while his father would say, that nobody, to be

" sure, is of noble birth but Alexander, and that his father was

" inglorious fpr want of such nobility. If they be at any time

" hunting, and he says nothing, he gives offence; and if he com-

ly Commended Antipater, as the only child that had an affection

for his father, and on that account was an impediment to the o-

thers plot against him. Hereupon the king, who had hardly re­

pressed his anger upon the former accusations, was exasperated

to an incurable degree. At which time Antipater took another

occasion to send in other persons to his father to accuse his breth­

cundus audTyrannus, who had once been masters of the horse to

the king, but for some offences had been put out of that honour­

formations, and presently ordered those men to be tortured: yet
