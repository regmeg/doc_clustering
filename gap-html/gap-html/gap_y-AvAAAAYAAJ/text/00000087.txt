Ghap. VI. ANTIQJJIT1ES OF THE JEWS. 9J

tween them, as they once were in a chariot together, concerning

Tiberius ; Agrippa praying [to God], (for they two sat by

.themselves ,, that " Tiberius might soon go off the stage, and

" leave the government to Caius, who was in every respect more

" worthy of it." ' Now, Eutychus, who was Agrippa's freed-

man, and drove his chariot, heard these words, and at that time

said nothing of them ; but when Agrippa accused him of steal,

ing some garments of his, (which was certainly true), he ran

away from him ; but, when he was caught, and brought before

Piso, who was governor of the city, and the man was asked,

why he ran away ? he replied, that he had somewhat to say to

Cjesar, that tended to his security and preservation : so Piso

bound him, and sent him to Caprepe. But Tiberius, according

to his usual custom, kept him still in bonds, being a delayer of

affairs, if ever there was any other king or tyrant that was so ;

for he did not admit ambassadors quickly, and no successors were

dispatched away to governors or procurators of the provinces,

that had been formerly sent, unless they were dead ; whence it

was, that he was so negligent in hearing the causes of prisoners;

insomuch, that when he was asked by his friends, what was the

reason of his delay in such cases ? he said, That " he delayed to

" hear ambassadors, lest, upon their quick dismission, other

" ambassadors should be appointed, and return upon him ; and

" so he should bring trouble upon himself in their public recep-

" tion and dismission : that he permitted those governors, who

" had been sent once to their government [to stay there a great

" while], out of regard to the subjects that were under them ;

" for that all governors are naturally disposed to get as much

" as they can, and that those who are not to fix there, but to

" stay n short time, and that at an uncertainty, when they shall

" be turned out, do the more severely hurry themselves on to

': fleece the people ; but that, if their government be long con-

" tinued to them, they are at last satiated with the spoils, as

" having gotten a vast deal, and so become at leYigth less sharp

" in their pillaging; but that, if successors are sent quickly, the

" poor subjects, who are exposed to them as a prey, will not be

" able to bear the new ones, while they shall not have the same

" time allowed them, wherein their predecessors had filled them-

" selves, and so grew more unconcerned about getting more ;

" and this because they are removed before they have had time

" [for their oppressions]. He gave them an example to shew

" his meaning: NA great number cf flies came about the sore

" places of a man that had been wounded ; upon which one of

f the standers-by pitied the man's misfortune, and, thinking he

" was not able to drive those flies away himself, was going to

" drive
