428 WARS OF THE JEWS. Book II.

the people, they were kept under by the seditious; but the se­

ditious themselves were greatly affrighted at the good order of

the Romans, and retired from the suburbs, and retreated into

the inner part of the city, and into the temple. But when Ces-

tius was come into the city, he set the part called JSezetba, which

is called Cenopolis, [or the new city], on fire; as he did also to

the timber market: after which he came into the upper city,

and pitched his camp over against the royal palace; and had he

but at this very time attempted to get within the walls by force,

he had won the city presently, and the war had been put an end

to at once; but Tyrannius Priscus, the muster-,master of the

army, and a great number of the officers of the horse, had been

corrupted by Florus, and diverted him from that his attempt;

and that was the occasion that this war lasted so very long, and

thereby the Jews were involved in such incurable calamities.

5. In the mean time, many of the principal men of the city

were persuaded by Ananus, the son of Jonathan, and invited

Cestius into the city, and were about to open the gates for himj

but he overlooked this offer, partly out of his anger at the Jews,

and partly because he did not thoroughly believe they were in

the seditious perceived the treachery, and threw Ananus and

those of his party down from the wall, and pelting them with

stones, drove them into their houses; but they stood themselves

at proper distances in the towers, and threw their darts at those

that were getting over the wall. Thus did the Romans make

their attack against the wall for five days, but to no purpose :

but on the next day, Cestius took a great many of his choicest

men, and with them the archers, and attempted to break into

the temple at the northern quarter of it; but the Jews beat them

off from the cloisters, and repulsed them several times when they

were gotten near to the wall, till at length the multitude of the

darts cut them off, and made them retire: but the first rank of

the Romans rested their shields upon the wall, and so did those

that were behind them, and the like did those that were still

more backward, and guarded themselves with what they call

Testudo, [the back of] a tortoise, upon which the darts that

were thrown fell, and slided off without doing them any harm ;

so the soldiers undermined the wall, without being themselves

hurt, and got all things ready for setting fire to the gate of the

temple.

6. And now it was that a horrible fear seized upon the sedi­

tious, insomuch, that many of them ran out of the city,as though

it were to be taken immediately; but the people upon this took

courage, and where the wicked part of the city gave ground,
