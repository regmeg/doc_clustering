" joy double pleasure, which is truly worthy of thy evil disposi-

" tion, which thou hast openly shewed against thy brethren ; on

'1 which account thou didst rejoice, as having done a most famous

" exploit, nor was that behaviour unworthy of thee. But if

" thy intention were otherwise thou art worse than they ; while

" thou didst contrive to hide thy treachery against thy father,

" thou didst hate themr not as plotters against thy father, for in

" that case thou hadst not thyself fallen upon the like crime,

" but as successors of his dominions, and more worthy of that

" succession than thyself. Thou wouldst kill thy father after

" thy brethren, lest thy lies raised against them might be detect-

«' ed ; and lest thou shouldst suffer what punishment thou hadst

" deserved, thou hadst a mind to exact that punishment of thy

" unhappy father, and didst devise such a sort of uncommon par-

" ricide as the world never yet saw. For thou who art his son

" did not only lay a treacherous design against thy father, and

'c didst it while he loved thee, and had been thy benefactor, had

M made thee in reality his partner in the kingdom, and had open-

" ly declared thee his successor, while thou wast not forbidden

" to taste the sweetness of authority already, and hadst the firm

" hope of what was future by thy father's determination, and

" the security of a written testament. But for certain, thou

" didst not measure these things according to thy father's va-

'' rious disposition, but according to thy own thoughts and incli-

" nations ; and wast desirous to take the part that remained

" away from thy too indulgent father, and soughtest to destroy

«' him with thy deeds, whom thou in words pretendedst to pre-

M serve. Nor wast thou content to be wicked thyself, but thou

" filledst thy mother's head with thy devices, and raised distur-

" bances among thy brethren, and hadst the boldness to call thy

" father a wild beast; while thou hadst thyself a mind more cruel

" than any serpent, whence thou sendest out that poison among thy

" nearest kindred and greatest benefactors, and invitedst them to

" assist thee and guard thee, and didst hedge thyself in on all

'' sides by the artifices of both men and women, against an old

" man ; as tho' that mind of thine was not sufficient of itself to

" support so great an hatred as thou baredst to him. And here

" thou appearest, after the tortures of free-men, of domestics, of

" men and women, which have been examined on thy account,

" and after the informations of thy fellow-conspirators, as ma-

«' king haste to contradict the truth ; and hast thought on ways

," not only how to take thy father out of the world, but to dis-

" annal that written law which is against thee, and the virtue

" of Varus, and the nature of justice ; nay, such is that impu-

" dence of thine on which thou confidest, that thou desirest to be

" put
