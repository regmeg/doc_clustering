Chap. -VI. ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS. 83

The man also grew eld in that honourable post, and therein

died. But all this happened a 'good while later. ,

7. Now Agrippa stood in his bonds before the royal palace,

and leaned on a certain tree for grief, with many others, who

were in bonds alio ; and as a certain bird sat upon the tree on

which Agrippa leaned, (the Romans call this bird bulo), [an owl],

one of those :that were bound, a German by nation, saw him,

and asked a soldier what that man in purple was ? and when he

was informed that his name was Agrippa, and that he was by

nation a Jew, and one of the principal men of that nation, he

asked leave of the soldier to whom he was bound *, to let him

come nearer to him, to speak with him'; for that he had a mind

to inquire of him about some things relating to his country ;

which liberty when he had obtained, and as he stood near him,

he said thus to him by an interpreter, That" this sudden change

" soon be delivered from them, and wilt be promoted to the

" highest dignity and power, and thou wilt be envied by all

" those who now pity thy hard fortune ; and thou wilt be hap-

" children whom thou shalt have. But, do thou remember,

" when thou seest this bird again, that thou wilt then live but

" five days longer. This event will be brought to pass by that

" God who hath sent this bird hither to be a sign unto thee.

" And I cannot but think it unjust to conceal from thee what I

" foreknow concerning thee, that, by thy knowing beforehand

" what happiness is coming upon thee, thou mayest not regard

" thy present misfortunes. But, when this happiness shall ac-
