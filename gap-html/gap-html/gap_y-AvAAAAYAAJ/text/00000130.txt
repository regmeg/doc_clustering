dius had gone out before, Cains turned aside into a private narrow

passage, in order to go to the place for bathing, as also in order

to take a view of the boys that came out of Asia, who were sent

thence, partly to sing hymns in these mysteries which were now

celebrated, and partly to dance in the pyrric way of dancing

upon the theatres. So Cherea met him, and asked him for the

watch-word ; upon Caius's giving him one of his ridiculous

words, he immediately reproached him, and drew his sword, and

gave him a terrible stroke with it, yet was not this stroke mor­

tal. And although there be those that say, it was so contrived

on purpose by Cherea, that Caius should not be killed at one

blow, but should be punished more severely by a multitude of

wounds, yet does this story appear to me incredible ; because

the fear men are under in such actions does not allow them to

use their reason. And if Cherea was of that mind, I esteem him

the greatest of all fools, in pleasing himself in his spite against

Caius, rather than immediately procuring safety to himself and

to his confederates from the dangers they were in -, because there

might many things still happen for helping Caius's escape, if he

had not already given up the ghost; for certainly Cherea would

have regard, not so much to the punishment of Caius, as to the

affliction himself and his friends were in, while it was in his

power, after such success, to keep silent, and to escape the wrath

of Caius's defenders, and not leave it to uncertainty whether he

should gain the end he aimed at or not, and after an unreasonable

manner to act as if he had a mind to ruin himself, and lose the

opportunity that lay before him ; but every body may guess as

he pleases about this matter. However, Caius was staggered'

with the pain that blow gave him ; for the stroke of the sword

falling in the middle, between the shoulder and the neck, washin-

tlered by the first bone of the breabt from proceeding any farther.

Nor did he either cry out, in such astonishment was he, nor did he

call out for any of his friends ; whether it were that he had no

confidence in them, or that his mind was otherwise disordered, but

he groaned under the pain he endured, and presently went for­

ward and fled ; when Cornelius Sabinu«, who was already

prepared in mind so to do, thrust him down upon his knee,

where many of them stood'round about him, and struck him with

their swords, and they cried out, and encouraged one another all

at once to strike him Ejgain; but all agree that Aquila gave him

the finishing stroke, which directly killed him. But one may

justly ascribe this act to Cherea ; for although many concurred in

the act itself, yet was he the first contriver .of it, and began long

before all the rest to prepare for it, and was the first man that

boldly spake of it to the rest; and upon their admission of what
