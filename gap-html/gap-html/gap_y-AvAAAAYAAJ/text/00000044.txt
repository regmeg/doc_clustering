36 ANTIOJUTIES OF THE JEWS. Book XVII.

" and appealed to his changing the commanders in the army,

" and his sitting in the royal throne before-hand, and his deter-

" minatiou of law-salts ; all done as if he were no other than a

" king. He appealed also to his concessions to those that peti-

" tioned him on a public account, and indeed doing such tilings,

" than which he could devise no greater if he had been already

" settled in the kingdom by Caesar. He also ascribed to him

«' the releasing of the prisoners that were ia the Hippodrome,

" and many other things, that either had been certainly done

" by him, or were believed to be done, and easily might be be-

" lieved to have been done, because they were of such a nature,

«' as to be usually done by young men, and by such as, out 'of

" a desire of ruling, seize upon the government too soon. He

" also charged him with his neglect of the funeral-mourning for

" his father, and with having merry meetings the very night

" in which he died ; and that it was thence the multitude took

«' the handle of raising a tumult; and if Archelaus could thus-

" requite his dead father, who had btstowed such benefits upon

" him, and bequeathed such great things to him, by pretending

" the greatest crime of all was this, that he came now before

" Caesar to obtain the government by his grant, while he had be-

«« fore acted in all things as he could have acted if Caesar him-

«' self, who ruled all, had fixed him firmly in the government.

" And what be most aggravated in his pleading, was the slaugh-

" ter of those about the temple, and the impiety of it, as done

" at the festival; and how they were slain like sacrifices them-

"' selves, some of whom were foreigners, and others of their

«' o-wn country, till the temple was full of dead bodies : and all

" this was done, not by an alien, but by one who pretended to

" the lawful title of a king, that he might complete the wicked

" tyranny which his nature prompted him to, and which is

" hated by all men. On which account his father never so

" much as dreamed of making him his successor in the king-

*' dom, when he was of a sound mind, because he knew his dis-  
" position ; and, in his former and more authentic testament, he

" appointed his antagonist Antipas to succeed ; but that Arche-
