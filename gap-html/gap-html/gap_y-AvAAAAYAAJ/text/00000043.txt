Chap. IX. ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS. , 35

Nicolaus, one that had been Herod's most honoured friend, and

was now zealous for Antipas : but it was Ireneus the orator,

and one who, on account of his reputation for sagacity, was en­

trusted with the affairs of the kingdom, who most of all encou­

raged him to attempt to gain the kingdom; by whose means it

was, that when some advised him to yield to Archelaus, as to

his elder brother, and who had been declared king by their fa­

ther's last will, he would not submit so to do. And when he

was come to Rome, all his relations revolted to him ; not out of*

their good-will to him, but out of their hatred to Archelaus;

though indeed they were most of all desirous of gaining their

liberty, and to be put under a Roman governor ; but, if there

were too great an opposition made to that, they thought Antipas

preferable to Archelaus, and so joined with him, in order to

procure the kingdom for him. Sabinus also, by letters, accused

Archelaus to Caesar.

5. Now, when Archelaus had sent in his papers to Caesar,

wherein he pleaded his right to the kingdom, and his father's

testament, with the accounts of Herod's money, and with Pto­

lemy, who brought Herod's seal, he so expected the event; but

when Caesar had read these papers, and Varus's and Sabinus's

letters, with the accounts of the money, and what were the an­

nual incomes of the kingdom, and understood that Antipas had

also sent letters to lay claim to the kingdom, he summoned his

friends together, to know their opinions, and with them Caius,

the son of Agrippa, -and of Julia his daughter, xvhom he had

adopted, and took him, and made him sit first of all, and desired

such as pleased to speak their minds about the affairs now be­

fore them. Now Antipater, Salome's son, a very subtle orator,

and a bitter enemy to Archelaus, spake first to this purpose :

That " it was ridiculous in Archelaus to plead now to have the

" kingdom given him, since he had, in reality, taken already

a the power over it to himself, before Caesar had granted it to

" him ; and appealed to those bold actions of his, in destroying

" so many at the Jewish festival; and, if the men had acted un-

* justly, it was but fit the punishing of them should have been  
" reserved to those that were out of the country, but had the

" power to punish them, and not been executed by a man that,

" if he pretended to be a king, he did an injury to Caesar, by

" usurping that authority before it was determined for him by

" Caesar ; but, if he owned himself to be a private person, his

" case was much worse, since he who was putting in for the

" kingdom, could by no means expect to have that power

" granted him, of which he had akeady deprived Ctesar [by

'' taking it to himself]. He also touched sharply upon him,
