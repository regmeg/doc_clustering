88 ROMAN EMPIRE.

Belisarius, recedes on all sides from our view: the

Roman name, the proper subject of our inquiries, is

reduced to a narrow corner of Europe, to the lonely

suburbs of Constantinople; and the fate of the Greek

empire has been compared to that of the Rhine, which

loses itself in the sands, before its waters can mingle

with the ocean. The scale of dominion is dimi­

nished to our view by the distance of time and place:

nor is the loss of external splendour compensated

by the nobler gifts of virtue and genius. In

the last moments of her decay, Constantinople was

doubtless more opulent and populous than Athens at

her most flourishing era, when a scanty sum of six

thousand talents, or twelve hundred thousand pounds

sterling, was possessed by twenty-one thousand male

citizens of an adult age. But each of these citizens

was a freeman who dared to assert the liberty of his

thoughts, words, and actions; whose person and pro­

his independent vote in the government of the republic.

Their numbers seem to be multiplied by the strong and

various discriminations of character: under the shield

of freedom, on the wings of emulation and vanity, each

Athenian aspired to the level of the national dignity:

from this commanding eminence, some chosen spirits

soared beyond the reach of a vulgar eye; and the

chances of superior merit in a great and populous

kingdom, as they are proved by experience, would ex­

cuse the computation of imaginary millions. The, ter­

ceed a moderate province of France or England: but

after the trophies of Salamis and Plataea, they expand

in our fancy to the gigantic size of Asia, which had

been trampled under the feet of the victorious Greeks.

But the subjects of the Byzantine empire, who assume

and dishonour the names both of Greeks and Romans,

present a dead uniformity of abject vices, which are
