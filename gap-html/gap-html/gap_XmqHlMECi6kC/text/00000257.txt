distress: their cause was espoused by Venice, Pope

Alexander III., and the Greek emperor: the fabric of

oppression was overturned in a day; and in the treaty

of Constance, Frederic subscribed, with some reserva­

tions, the freedom of four-and-twenty cities. His grand-

Predcncii.son contended with their vigour and maturity;

—mo1" hut Frederic II.k was endowed with some per­

sonal and peculiar advantages. His birth and

education recommended him to the Italians; and in

the implacable discord of the two factions, the Ghibe-

displayed the banner of liberty and the church. The

court of Rome had slumbered, when his father Henry

VI. was permitted to unite with the empire the king­

doms of Naples and Sicily: and from these hereditary

realms, the son derived an ample and ready supply of

troops and treasure. Yet Frederic II. was finally op­

pressed by the arms of the Lombards and the thunders

of the Vatican; his kingdom was given to a stranger,

and the last of his family was beheaded at Naples

on a public scaffold. During sixty years, no em­

peror appeared in Italy, and the name was remem­

bered only by the ignominious sale of the last relicts

of sovereignty.

The barbarian conquerors of the west were

pleased to decorate their chief with the title of

tinian. The persons of the Germans were free, their

conquests were their own, and their national character

was animated by a spirit which scorned the servile

jurisprudence of the new or the ancient Roman. It

would have been a vain and dangerous attempt to im­

pose a monarch on the armed freemen, who were impa­

tient of a magistrate; on the bold, who refused to obey;
