CHAP. XLVIII. 135

senate, and the clergy, approached in due order to

adore and kiss the inanimate corpse of their sovereign.

Before the procession moved towards the imperial se­

pulchre, a herald proclaimed this awful admonition:—

Arise, O king of the world, and obey the summons of the

King of kings!

Roman™ The death of Constantine was imputed to

A.'0^959, poison; and his son Romanus, who derived

NoV. is. that name from his maternal grandfather,

ascended the throne of Constantinople. A prince

who, at the age of twenty, could be suspected of anti­

cipating his inheritance, must have been already lost

in the public esteem; yet Romanus was rather weak than

wicked; and the largest share of the guilt was trans­

ferred to his wife, Theophano, a woman of base origin,

masculine spirit, and flagitious manners. The sense of

personal glory, and public happiness, the true pleasures

of royalty, were unknown to the son of Constantine;

and while the two brothers, Nicephorus and Leo, tri­

umphed over the Saracens, the hours which the empe­

ror owed to his people were consumed in strenuous

idleness. In the morning he visited the circus; at

noon he feasted the senators; the greater part of the

afternoon he spent in the sphceristerium, or tennis-

court, the only theatre of his victories; from thence he

passed over to the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus,

hunted and killed four wild boars of the largest size,

and returned to the palace, proudly content with the

labours of the day. In strength and beauty he was

conspicuous above his equals: tall and straight as a

young cypress, his complexion was fair and florid, his

eyes sparkling, his shoulders broad, his nose long and

aquiline. Yet even these perfections were insufficient

to fix the love of Theophano; and, after a reign of four

years, she mingled for her husband the same deadly

draught which she had composed for his father. .
