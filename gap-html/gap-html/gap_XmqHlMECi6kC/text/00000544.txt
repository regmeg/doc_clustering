thirst and hunger guarded the desert of Mesopotamia:

and the emperor, satiated with glory, and laden with ori­

in his triumph, the silk, the aromatics, and three hun­

the east had been bent, not broken, by this transient

hurricane. After the departure of the Greeks, the fu­

Moslems again purified their temples, and overturned

the idols of the saints and martyrs; the Nestorians and

Jacobites preferred a Saracen to an orthodox master;

and the numbers and spirit of the Melchites were in­

adequate to the support of the church and state. Of

these extensive conquests, Antioch, with the cities of

Cilicia and the isle of Cyprus, was alone restored, a

permanent and useful accession to the Roman empire."
