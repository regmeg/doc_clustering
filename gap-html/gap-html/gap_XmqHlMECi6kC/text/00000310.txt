300 ROMAN EMPIRE.

the idolaters, are sunk below each other in the abyss;

and the lowest hell is reserved for the faithless hypo­

crites who have assumed the mask of religion. After

the greater part of mankind has been condemned for

their opinions, the true believers only will be judged by

their actions. The good and evil of each Mussulman

will be accurately weighed in a real or allegorical ba­

lance, and a singular mode of compensation will be al­

lowed for the payment of injuries: the aggressor will

refund an equivalent of his own good actions for the

his sins will be loaded with an adequate share of the

demerits of the sufferer. According as the shares of

guilt or virtue shall preponderate, the sentence will be

pronounced, and all, without distinction, will pass over

the sharp and perilous bridge of the abyss: but the in­

fall into the first and mildest of the seven hells. The

term of expiation will vary from nine hundred to seven

shall be saved, by their own faith and his intercession,

from eternal damnation. It is not surprising that super­

stition should act most powerfully on the fears of her

votaries, since the human fancy can paint with more

energy the misery than the bliss of a future life. With

the two simple elements of darkness and fire, we create

a sensation of pain, which may be aggravated to an in­

finite degree by the idea of endless duration. But the

same idea operates with an opposite effect on the conti­

nuity of pleasure; and too much of our present enjoy­

ments is obtained from the relief, or the comparison, of

evil. It is natural enough that an Arabian prophet

should dwell with rapture on the groves, the fountains,

and the rivers of paradise; but instead of inspiring the
