170 ROMAN E.MPIRE.

who had sense to choose, and severity to punish. He

prohibited the inhuman practice of pillaging the goods

and persons of shipwrecked mariners; the provinces,

so long the objects of oppression or neglect, revived in

prosperity and plenty; and millions applauded the

distant blessings of his reign, while he was cursed by

the witnesses of his daily cruelties. The ancient pro^

verb, that blood-thirsty is the man who returns from

banishment to power, had been applied with too much

truth to Marius and Tiberius; and was now verified for

the third time in the life of Andronicus. His memory

was stored with a black list of the enemies and rivals,

who had traduced his merit, opposed his greatness, or

portion of his guilt; but the mask was fallen, and his

subjects could no longer mistake the true author of their

calamities. The noblest of the Greeks, more especially

those who, by descent or alliance, might dispute the

Comnenian inheritance, escaped from the monster's den:

rial title. Yet Andronicus resisted the daggers and

swords of his most formidable enemies: Nice and Prusa

were reduced and chastised: the Sicilians were content

with the sack of Thessalonica; and the distance of Cy-
