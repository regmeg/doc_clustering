J52 ROMAN EMPIRE.

the city, and erected the standard of civil war. The

soldiers, who had been gradually assembled in the ca­

of her parent. Yet, instead of the simplicity of style and

narrative which wins our belief, an elaborate affectation

of rhetoric and science betrays in every page the vanity

of a female author. The genuine character of Alexius
