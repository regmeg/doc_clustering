140 ROMAN EMPIRE.

had no temptation to violate their right of succession:

their patrimony was ably and faithfully administered;

and the premature death of Zimiscea was a loss, rather

than a benefit, to the sons of Romanus. Their want of

and Zimisces would not suffer their royal pupil to sleep

in the palace. His long and frequent expeditions

against the Saracens were rather glorious, than useful

to the empire; but the final destruction of the kingdom

of Bulgaria appears, since the time of Belisarius, the
