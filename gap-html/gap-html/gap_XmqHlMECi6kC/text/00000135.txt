was their final settlement. During several generations

they maintained the dignity of their birth; and their

Roman patriotism rejected the tempting offers of the

Persian and Arabian powers, who recalled them to

their native country. But their splendour was insen­

sibly clouded by time and poverty; and the father of

Basil was reduced to a small farm, which he cultivated

on the steps of the church of St Diomede: he was fed

by the casual hospitality of a monk; and was introduced

to the service of a cousin and namesake of the emperor
