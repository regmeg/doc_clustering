Id ROMAN EMPIRE,

Ptolemies, and a long proscription of seven hundred

years since the foundation of Alexandria. Without

any legal sentence, without any royal mandate, the pa­

triarch, at the dawn of day, led a seditious multitude to

the attack of the synagogues. Unarmed and unprepar­

face of Orestes was covered with blood. The loyal

citizens of Alexandria hastened to his rescue; he in­

stantly satisfied his justice and revenge against the

monk, by whose hand he had been wounded, and Am-

monius expired under the rod of the lictor. At the com­

mand of Cyril, his body was raised from the ground,

and transported, in solemn procession, to the cathe­

dral ; the name of Ammonius was changed to that of
