sharing his imperial fortune, was dismissed with igno­

miny from his bed and palace. In their last interview,

she displayed a frantic and impotent rage; accused the

ingratitude of her lover; assaulted with words and

blows her son Basil, as he stood silent and submissive

in the presence of a superior colleague; and avowed

her own prostitution in proclaiming the illegitimacy of

his birth. The public indignation was appeased by

her exile, and the punishment of the meaner accom­

and the guilt of Zimisces was forgotten in the splen­

dour of his virtues. Perhaps his profusion was less

useful to the state than the avarice of Nicephorus; but

his gentle and generous behaviour delighted all who

approached his person; and it was only in the paths of

victory that he trode in the footsteps of his predecessor.

The greatest part of his reign was employed in the

camp and the field: his personal valour and activity

were signalized on the Danube and the Tigris, the an­

cient boundaries of the Roman world; and by his

double triumph over the Russians and the Saracens,

he deserved the titles of saviour of the empire, and

conqueror of the east. In his last return from Syria,

he observed that the most fruitful lands of his new pro­

vinces were possessed by the eunuchs. And is it for

them (he exclaimed, with honest indignation,) that we

have fought and conquered? Is it for them that we

shed our blood, and exhaust the treasures of our people?

The complaint was re-echoed to the palace, and the

death of Zimisces is strongly marked with the suspicion

of poison.

Basil ii. Under this usurpation, or regency, of twelve

Mantin^" years, the two lawful emperors, Basil and Con-

976,Aj^! stantme, had silently grown to the age of man-

10- hood. Their tender years had been incapable

of dominion: the respectful modesty of their attendance

and salutation, was due to the age and merit of their
