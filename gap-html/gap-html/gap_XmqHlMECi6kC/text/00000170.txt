to the beauteous Maria, a French or Latin princess of

Antioch. The only daughter of his first wife was des足

of Isaac, and grandson of Alexius Comnenus, is one of

the most ^conspicuous characters of the age: and his

genuine adventures might form the subject of a very

singular romance. To justify the choice of three ladies
