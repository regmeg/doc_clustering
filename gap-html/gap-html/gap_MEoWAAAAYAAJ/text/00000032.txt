mented that by their crimes they had called down

upon themselves the indignation of the gods. Rrusus

look advantage of the moment. The opportunity was

the effect of chance; but, rightly managed, might

conduce to the wisest purpose.

He gave orders that the men who by honest means

were most in credit with the malcontents, should go

round from tent to tent. Among these was Clemens,

the centurion. They visited every part of the camp;

they applied to the guards on duty; they conversed

speaking, he delivered himself with the eloquence of

a man who felt his own importance, and the dignity

of his rank. He condemned the past, and applauded

the present. It was not, he said, a part of his charac­

ter to yield to menaces, or to shrink from danger. If

lie saw them penitent, if he heard the languago of re­

morse, he would make a report in their favour, and
