shame and remorse succeeded, and every breast was

touched with sympathy. All lamented the condition

of Agrippina. They called to mind the splendour of

her father Agrippa; they recollected the majesty of

Augustus, her grand-father; they remembered Dru-

sus, her father-in-law: her own personal accomplishÂ­
