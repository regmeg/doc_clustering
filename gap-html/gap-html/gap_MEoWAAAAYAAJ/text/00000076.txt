LXXXI.' Of the consular elections, either in this

year, or during the rest of his reign, nothing can be

said with precision. His own speeches, as well as the

historians of the time, are so much at variance, that

nothing like system can be traced. We see the em­

peror, in some instances, holding the name of the

candidate in reserve, yet by an account of his birth,

his public conduct, and his military services, pointing

directly to the man. At other times he refuses even

that satisfaction, content with general directions to

the candidates, not to embroil the election by intrigue

or bribery, but to leave the whole to his management.

His custom in general was to profess, that ho knew

no candidates but those, whose names he had trans­

mitted to the consuls; others, he said, were free to

offer themselves, if, from their merit or their interest,

they conceived hopes of success. With speeches of

this nature, plausible indeed, but unsubstantial, the

people were amused. A show of liberty was held forth,

fair in appearance, but deceitful, and, for that reason,

tending to plunge mankind in deeper servitude.
