THE

ANNALS OF TACITUS.

BOOK II.

1. During the consulship of Sisenna Statilius

Taurus and Lucius Libo, the oriental kingdoms, and,

by consequence, the Roman provinces were thrown

into commotion. The name of discord was lighted

despatched Vonones, richly loaded with.presents. The

barbarians, pleased, as is their custom, with the open­

ing of a new reign, received the prince with all de­

monstrations of joy. But disaffection soon took place;
