were all suppressed. It was also confidently said that

Piso did not lay violent hands on himself, but died by

the stroke of an assassin. For the truth of these asÂ­

sertions I do not mean to be answerable; I state the

facts as I heard them related by men with whom I

conversed in my youth; and the anecdotes of such

men may be deemed worthy of attention.

Tiberius attended the next meeting of the senate.

He there complained with seeming anxiety, that the

death of Piso was ' intended to reflect dishonour on

himself. He sent for the freedman, who had received

the paper sealed up, as already stated, and inquired

particularly about his master; how he passed the last
