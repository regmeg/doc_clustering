A. D.21.] OF TACITUS. 167

Valerius Messalinus; a man who derived from hia

father Messala, the celebrated orator, no inconsiderÂ­

able share of eloquence.. " The rigour," he said, " of

" ancient manners has taken a milder tone. The

" enemy is not at the gates of Rome, and the pro-

" vinces have no hostile intentions. In favour of the

" tender sex some concessions ought to be made,

" especially since it is now known by experience that

" the wife, so far from being a burden to the province,
