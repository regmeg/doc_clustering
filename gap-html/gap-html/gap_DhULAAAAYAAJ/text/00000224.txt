at速 THE DESCRIPTION

but the other sort, which is white, purifies by acting as

an emetic. The Anticyrans likewise have brazen statues

in their forum. In their haven too they have a temple of

Neptune of a moderate size, and which is built of chosen

stones. The inward parts are of white plaster. The statue

in this temple is of brass, is in an upright position, and

stands with one of its feet on a dolphin. One of its hands

too is on its thigh, and with the other it holds a tri足

dent. They have besides two gymnasia. One of these

contains baths; and in the other, which is at some distance

from this, and is ancient, there is a brazen statue. The

inscription on this statue signifies, that it is the image of

the pancratiast Xenodamus the Anticyran, who was victo足

rious over men in the Olympic games. If this inscription

therefore is true, it must follow, that Xenodamus received

the olive crown, in the two hundred and eleventh Olym足

piad, and that the Eleans have omitted to mention him

alone, in their account of the victors in the games. Above

the forum there is a fountain of water in a well: and a

roof supported by pillars screens this well from the fun.

A little beyond this well there is a monument raised from

such stones as were accidentally found. They fay that the

sons of Iphitus are buried in this tomb; that one of these

returned safe from Troy, and died in his own house; but

that the other, Schedius, fell before Troy, and that his

bones were brought hither.
