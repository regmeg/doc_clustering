which they say was denominated from the daughter of

Ogygus. There is a temple here of Diana, which con­

tains two flone statues: one of these holds a torch, and

the other is in the attitude of one shooting an arrow.

They fay, that when the Greeks, in consequence of the

prophesy os Chalcas, were about to sacrifice Iphigenia on

the altar in this temple, the goddess caused a stag to be the

victim instead of her. Even at present, too, they pre­

serve in this temple the remains of the trunk of that plane-

tree, which is mentioned by Homer in the Iliad. It is

likewise said, that when the Greeks were detained at

Aulis by adverse winds, the wind on a sudden blew from

the desired quarter; and then each person sacrificed to

Diana whatever victims came to hand, both male and

female: in consequence of this it became an established

custom in Aulis, to approve victims of every kind. They

fliew a fountain here, near which a plane-tree grows;

and on a hill near the tent of Agamemnon, there is a

brazen threshold. But palm-trees grow before the temple,

the fruit of which is not perfectly sweet to the taste, like

that of the palm-trees in Palæstine; but yet these dates

are milder than those which are gathered in Ionia. There

are not many inhabitants in Aulis; and these are all of

them potters. The Tanagræi, too, and those that dwell

about Mycalessus and Harma, cultivate this land.
