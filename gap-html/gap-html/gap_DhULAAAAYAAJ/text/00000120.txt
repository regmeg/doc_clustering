io6 THE DESCRIPTION

were in a very desponding condition through the mag«

nitude of the fine, Philomelas the son of Theotimus,

who was not inferior in nobility to any of the Pho­

cenfes, and whoic country was Ledon a Phocic city,

shewed them that it was impossible for them to pay the

fine, and persuaded them to plunder the temple of

the Delphic Apollo. Amon£ other arguments which

he offered in order to effect this, he informed them,

that the affairs of the Athenians, and Lacedxmonians

were in a condition very well adapted to the execution

of this design and that if the Thebans or any other na­

tion should make war upon them, they might easily van­

quish their enemies, both by their own valour, and the

money which they would be enabled to expend. This

speech of Philomelus was favourably received by the mul­

understandings or whether these people naturally preferred

gain to piety. The Phocenfes therefore plundered the

temple of Apollo, when Heraclides governed the Delphi,

and Agathocles was the Athenian aichonj and in the

fourth year of the one hundred and fifth Olympiad, in

which the Cyrenæan Prorus was victorious. After this

they collected together a very powerful army of merce­

nary soldiers; and the Thebans openly declared war against

them, in consequence of being at variance with them

prior to this event.

-This war lasted for ten years; and during the conti­  
nuance of it, the Phocenfes with their mercenary troops

were sometimes victorious, and this was often the cafe

with the Thebans. But an engagement taking place near

she city Neon, the Phocenfes were put to flight, and in

this flight Philwnelus hurled himsejf from a precipice,
