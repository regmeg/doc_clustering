2o4 THE DESCRIPTION

designed by this to honour the builder of their city, or

whether they raised this pillar as a mark of honour over a

sepulchre. They have likewise a temple of Æsculapius,

in which there is a statue with a beard. The names .of

those who made this statue are Timocles and Timarchides;

and both of them derived their origin from the Attic

land. In the extremity of the city, on the right hand,

there are a theatre, and an ancient brazen statue of

Minerva. They fay that this goddess defended them

against the Barbarians that fought under the command

of Taxilus. The temple too of Minerva Cranæa is

about twenty stadia distant from Elatea. The road to

this temple is rather steep, but its elevation cannot be

perceived by those that ascend it. At the end of this

road there is a hill, which is for the most part steep,

but which is neither very bulky nor very lofty. On the

top of this hill is the temple of Minerva; and in it there

are porches, and places of habitation in the porches.

Those that minister to the goddess dwell here; and the

person that presides over the sacred concerns in particular

takes up his residence in one of these habitations. They

choose this person out of the number of beardless youths,

and take care that he resigns his office before he has a

beard. He performs the office of priest to the goddess for

five continued years; and during all this time he lives

with the goddess, and bathes himself in basons after the

ancient manner. But the statue of the goddess was made

by the sons of Polycles, and has the appearance of one

prepared for a battle. Her shield too is fashioned in imi­

tation of that among the Athenians which is called the

shield of the virgin.
