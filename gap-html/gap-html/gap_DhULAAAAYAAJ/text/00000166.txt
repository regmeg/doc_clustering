ISZ THE DESCRIPTION

CHAP. XIX.

Near the statue os Gorgias is the Scionean ScyHis,

who was renowned for heing able to descend into the

most profound parts of every sea. He taught his daughter

Cyana this art of diving. Both of them, therefore, when

the fleet of Xerxes was tolled about by a violent tempest

near mount Pelion, brought destruction on the three-

oared galleys of the Persians, by cutting away the ropes

that held the anchors, or any thing else that fastened the

ships under water. Hence, in memorial of this achieve­

ment, the Amphictyons dedicated his statue, and that of

his daughter. Among the statues which Nero took from

Delphos, was the statue of Cyana. Women, while they

are yet pure virgins, are said to descend with safety into

the sea. But here it is proper that I should relate what

is reported pf Lesbos. Certain Methymnæan fishermen

drew up out of the sea in their nets a head made from

the olive-tree. This head seemed to have something di­

vine in its form, but such as was foreign, and not agree­

able to the figure of the Grecian gods. The Methym-

næans, therefore, inquired of the Pythian deity of what

god or hero this head was the image, and received for

answer, that they should venerate Bacchus Cephallen.

Hence the Methymnæans kept the wooden head which

they drew out of the sea, venerated it with sacrifices and

prayers, and sent a brazen image instead of it to Delphos.

In the roof of the temple there are Diana, Latona, Apollo,

the Muses, the setting Sun, Bacchus, and the women who
