The following remarkable passage, indeed, mews that the an­

cients were in possession of a stone, from which they made ever­

his little treatise entitled lr^'<u 3auf»as-iai, or Wonderful Hiflories',

and is taken from Tacus. Taxo; iv ru ?rspi Xi5)«v, 0 xapuj-m; (pflo-i>>)

Stones fays, that the stone which is called Caryflius contains a

certain woolly and coloured substance, from which garments are

spun and wove. Wicks for lamps likewise are twisted from this

substance, which burn with a clear light, without being con­
