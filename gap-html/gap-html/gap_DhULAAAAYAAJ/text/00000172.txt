t;8 THE DESCRIPTION*

chus, who belonged to the Syrians near the river OronfesV .

was sent as a commander by Antiochus from Asia. These

forces being assembled at Thermopylæ, as soon as it was

known that the army of the Gauls had fixed their camps

in the borders of Magnesia and Phthiotis, they sent a thou-*

sand light-armed soldiers, and a chosen body of horse to the

river Sperchius, that the Barbarians might not pass over

the river without fighting their way, and being exposed

to the danger of a defeat. These forces, therefore, when

they came to the Sperchius, destroyed the bridges which

the Gauls had raised on it, and fixed their camps on the

banks of the river. Brennus, indeed, was not unskilled in

warlike affairs, but for a Barbarian sufficiently acute, and

experienced in the stratagems of war. On the following

night, therefore, leaving that part of the river on which

he had raised the bridges, he sent ten thousand soldiers,

who were skilled in swimming, and remarkably tall (for

the Gauls in general surpass other men in stature) to the

lower parts of the river, that the Greeks might not per­

ceive them as they were passing over-, and besides this,

he knew that the river in this part spread itself widely

over the plains, and produced a marsh and lake instead

of a strong and narrow stream.. In the night, therefore,

his forces swam over the marshy part of the river, some

of them using their shields, which they call thureoi, for

rafts, while others, who were taller than the rest, waded

through with their feet. The Greeks on the banks of the

Sperchius, as soon as they understood that the Barbarians

had passed over the marshy part of trie river, immediately

marched back to their army.
