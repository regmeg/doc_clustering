SECOND VOLUME. 31?

try the Waxen age, a dite, tyrannic, and cruel Use is implied,

which is entirely passive, and proceeds to the very extremity of

»ice. The order of these metals, as Proclus observes, har­

monizes with that of these lives. "For (fays he) gold is solar-

form, because the sun is solely immaterial light. But silver U

lunat-sorm, because the moon partakes of shadow, just as silver

does of rust. And bras is earthly, so far as, not having a nature

iimilar to a lucid body, it is replete with abundance of cor­

ruption.''

Page 19. CW/«.] The Curetes are gods of an unpolluted

guardian characteristic, and fi^l subsist in that order of gods

which is called by the Chaldean theologists toipot, intelleSual,

The Cory baa tej, who form the guardian triad of supermundane

Page 20. In consequence oshaving dethroned Saturn.~\ By Ju­

piter dethroning Saturn, nothing more is meant, than that

Jupiter is the medium, through which the prolific powers and

intellectual illuminations of Saturn proceed, and are participated

Page 29. The StymphaTian birds, and the Kemean Aon.] By

the Stymphalian birds which were driven away by Hercules,

and were so large that they obstructed the light of the sun, the

objects of phantasy are signified, which prevent the light of truth

from mining in the soul: and the Nemean lion signifies anger.

Page 31. Homer in the Iliad.] The verses alluded to by

Faufanias are these:

Heaven's gates spontaneous open to the pow'rs,

Heaven's sounding gates kept by the w inged hours.

Iliad S. v. 393.

Page 3 2. That the goddess it drawn by a mule."] The moon

may with great propriety be represented drawn by a mule, be­

cause, as Proclus on Hesiod, p. 174, observes, /lie resembles the

mixed nature of this animal; "becoming dark through her par­

ticipation of earth, and deriving her proper light from the fun."
