THIRD VOLUME. 347

and thus destroy as much as possible its very essence. But he

who, like Oedipus, is able to solve the ænigmas of the Sphinx,

or, in other words, to comprehend the dark essence of his phan­

tasy, will, by illuminating its obscurity with the light of in­

tellect, cause it, by becoming lucid throughout, to be no longer

what it was before.

Hence we may fee the propriety of the Egyptians placing a

Sphinx in the vestibule of the temple of Isis, who is the fame with

Minerva. For what the phantasy is in the microcosm man, that

Mther is in the universe. But opinion may be called the vestibule

of the rational soul, and the rational soul is as it were the temple

of that intellectual illumination which proceeds from Minerva.

In this vestibule therefore the phantasy is seated. And in a similar

manner æther is seated in the vestibule of that divine soul, which

is suspended from the deity of Minerva, and which may be called

her temple. So that æther is the Sphinx of the universe.

temporary with Linus, and is said to have composed poems and

hymns prior to Homer.

Page 59. That Chaos was first generated,'] In my Intro­

duction to the Parmenides of Plato, I have shewn that, in the

opinion of all antiquity, yf»i1o, in the verse of Hesiod alluded

to by Pausanias, was considered as meaning <was generated,

though in all the editions of Hesiod this word is translated suit,

as if the poet had said, that Chats was the first of all things. I

shall only add at present from Simplicius De Cœlo, p. 147,

"that Hesiod, when he sings.

Chaos of all tilings was the first pratluc'd,

insinuates that there was something prior to Chaos, from which

Chaos was produced. For it is always necessary that every

thing which is generated should be generated from something.

But this likewise is insinuated by Hesiod, that the first cause it

above all knowledge and every appellation."
