OF GREECE. 1&7

•nd is endeavouring to take off a ring from the left hand-

finger of Phocus ; and this for the following reason:

"When Phocus the son of Æacus passed over from

Ægina to that country which is now called Phocis, and

obtained the government of that part of the continent,

Iascus contracted a great friendship with him, and gave

him things suitable to his dignity, and a stone seal set in

gold. But Phocus not long after this returning to Ægina,

lost his life through the stratagems of Peleus. On this

account, therefore, in the picture, Iascus is desirous that

the seal may be considered as a monument of his friend­

ship j and Phocus very readily suffers him to take it off

his singer, that he may prove his friendlhip by shewing it.

Above these is Mæra, sitting on a stone. In the poem

called Nostoi, it is said that Ihe died while she was a vir­

gin; and that she was the daughter of Proetus, who was

the son of Thersander, and the grandson of Sisyphus.

/ fter Mæra, you will fee Actxon the son of Aristæus,

and his mother, holding the fawn of a hind in her hands,

and sitting on the lkin of a hind. A hunting dog stands

near her •, and this on account of the life of Actæon, and

the manner of his death. If again you look to the lower

parts of the picture, you will fee after Patroclus, Or­

pheus sitting on a certain hill, with a harp in his left hand,

and in his right hand the leaves of a willow-tree. He is

represented leaning on the trunk of this tree. The grove

itself appears to be sacred to Proserpine, and abounds, as

Homer represents it, with poplars and willows. The

figure of Orpheus is Grecian; and neither his garment,

nor the covering on his head, is Thracian. Promedon

Jeans on the other part of the willow.

Some are of opinion that thil^name was introduced by

Polygnotus,
