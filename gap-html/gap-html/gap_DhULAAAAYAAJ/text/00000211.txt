OF GREECE. 197

pile is raised for the sacrifice. They reckoifcit necessary

too to roll round the victims linen or flaxen bandages.

And this is the Egyptian mode of adorning the victims.

But they cause all the victims which are immolated to pass

in the procession; and it is the employment of some to

send them into the adytum, and of others who are before

the adytum to burn the tents; after which they speedily

depart from this place.

They fay too, that a certain person once among the

number of those who are forbidden to enter the adytum,

and who indeed was a profane man, when the pile was

enkindled, through curiosity and boldness entered the ady­

tum; that all parts of it appeared to him to be full of

spectres; and that on his returning to Tithonca, as soon

as he had related all that he had seen, he died. I have

heard things similar to these of a certain Phœnician.

They say that the Egyptians celebrate the festival of Isis

in that part of the year in which she bewails Osiris;

that then the Nile begins to ascend; and that the vulgar

of the natives fay, that the tears of Isis cause the Nile to

increase and irrigate the fields. At that time, therefore,

a certain Roman, who was the prefect of Egypt, per­

suaded a man, for a sum os money, to enter into the

adytum of Isis in Coptos. This man returned indeed,

but died as soon as he had told what he had seen.

Homer, therefore, appears to speak truly when he says,

that no man can clearly behold the gods, and at the fame

time be prosperous in his affairs. But Tithoræa produces

fewer olives than either the Attic or Sicyonian land. Its

olives, however, are superior both in colour and sweet­

ness to those which are brought from Spain and I stria.

They form all various kinds of ointments from these, and

send these olives as a present to Cæsar.
