• u The description

fled on the following night to the Ulyrians: and the As-

gives delivered up Thebes, which they had taken, to Ther­

sander the son of Polyniccs. As a great part, however,

of the forces which Agamemnon led against Troy, wan­

dered during their voyage from their destined course, and

were shipwrecked about Mysia, it happened that Ther-

sander, who in valour surpassed most of the Greeks in that

, war, was slain by Telephus. But the sepulchre of Ther­

sander is in the plains of Caicus* in the city Ehea. This-

sepulchre is of stone, and is in that«part of the forum

which is in the open air; in which placej as they fay, the

inhabitants perform funeral sacrifices in honour of him.

After the death of Thersander, a second fleet being fitted

out against Paris and the Trojans, the command of it was

given to Peneleus: for Tisamenus the son of Thersander

was not yet old enough for this purpose. But Peneleus

being slain by Eurypylus the son of Telephus, they chose

Tisamenus for their king, who was the son of Thersander

and Demonassa the daughter of Amphiaraus. This ThV

menus was free from the imprecations of Laiusand Oedi-

*pus; but Autesion the son of Tisamenus did not escape  
them, but was compelled on this account, in compliance

with an oracle, to migrate to the Dorienscs. After the

departure of Autesion, Damafichthon, the grandson of

Peneleus the son of Opheltes^ was chosen king. Ptolemy

was the son of this Damafichthon, and Xanthus of Pto-;

lemy, I mean that Xanthus whom Andropompus slew in

a single combat, by stratagem, and not in a lawful man­

ner. Afterwards it appeared better to the Thebans to

be governed by many, and not to commit the administra^

tion of affairs to one man alone.
