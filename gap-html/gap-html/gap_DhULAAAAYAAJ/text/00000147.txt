OP GREECE, 133

CHAP. XII.

A. STONE elevates itself above this place, on which

the Sibyl Herophile (as the Delphi fay) used to sing her

oracles. I have found that this Sibyl was thus denomi­

nated from the first in the fame manner as any other

ancient Sibyl. The Greeks fay that she was the daughter

of Jupiter and Lamia; that Lamia was the daughter of

Neptune; and that (he was the first woman that fang

oracles, and was denominated by the Africans Sibylla.

This Sibyl Herophile, indeed, was certainly posterior

to Lamia j but at the fame time it appears, that she

flourished prior to the Trojan war. For she predicted,

that Helen would be educated in Sparta, that she would

be the destruction of Asia and Europe, and that Troy

through her means would be taken by the Greeks. The

Delians make mention of her hymns to Apollo: and in

her verses she not only calls herself Herophile, but like­

wise Diana. She likewise asserts of herself, that she is the

wife of Apollo; and besides this, that she is his sister and

daughter. But these assertions are the result of her being

agitated with fury, and, possessed by the god. In another

part too of her oracles, she fays, that she was born from an

immortal mother, viz. one of the nymphs of mount Ida,

and a mortal father: for thus (lie speaks concerning

herself:

"From an immortal nymph, and whale-fed sire,

A mean between the two, I sprung to light,

From one of Ida's nymphs Ijegot; my native land

Is red Marpcssus where Aidoneus stows,

A country (acred to the mighty Op«."
