5S THE DESCRIPTION

the sophisms of Sphinx ; and that upon her inquiring whe­

ther, if they were the sons of Laius, they knew the oracle

given to Cadmus, if they answered in the negative, she

condemned them to death, as not being entitled by their

birth to the kingdom. Lastly, it is said that the inter­

pretation of the oracle was given to Oedipus in a dream,

who was by this means enabled to solve the riddle of

Sphinx.

The ruins of the city Onchestus are about fifteen stadia

distant from this mountain: and they fay that Onchestus

the son of Neptune once dwelt in this city. At present,

indeed, a temple and statue of Onchestian Neptune re­

main: and there is likewise a grove here which is cele­

brated by Homer. On turning from the temple of the

Cabiri to the left hand, and proceeding to the distance of

about fifty stadia, you will arrive at the city Thefpia, which

is situated under mount Helicon, and is said to have

been denominated from Thefpia the daughter of Asopus.

According to some, Thespius, when he left Athens, gave

this name to the city; and they fay that he was the son

of Erechtheus. Among the Thespians, there is even at

present a brazen statue of Jupiter the Saviour. They re­

port, that the city being once infested with a dragon, Ju­

piter ordered them to expose every year to the savage ani­

mal certain young men chosen by lot; and that the names

of those that perished except one sunk into oblivion. The

name of this one was Cleostratus, who had a brazen coat

of mail made for him by his lover Menestratus. This coat

of mail was thick set with hooks turned upwards: and

Cleostratus, a; med with this, very readily went forth to

meet the dragon; and was indeed himself slain, but at

the same time was the destruction of the savage beast.
