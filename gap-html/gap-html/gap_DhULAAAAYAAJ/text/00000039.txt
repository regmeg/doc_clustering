OF GREECE. aS

quence of their being deceived in this manner, Alcmene

was in reality delivered.

There is a temple here of Hercules with a stone statue,

which they call Promachos, or the defender: and this was

made by the Thebans, Xenocratus and Eubius. But the

Thebans are of opinion, that the ancient wooden statue

in this place was made by Dædalus ; and it appears to me,

that this was really the cafe. They fay that Dædalus de­

dicated this statue on account of the benevolent inter­

position of divinity in his favour. For when he had con­

structed for himself and his son Icarus a small ship, and

had discovered the use of sails, which were unknown be­

fore, so that he was able, in consequence of being driven

by a prosperous wind, to outstrip the vessel of Minos, he

himself escaped in safety; but they say that Icarus, being

unskilled in the art of piloting the fliip, overturned it,

and was by this means swallowed up by the waves, and

driven to an island of Pergamus, the name of which is

at present unknown. They add, that Hercules met

with the dead body, and, knowing it, buried it, where

even now there is a heap of earth not very large, in the

promontory which extends to the Ægean sea. But the

island and the sea about it were denominated from Icarus,

In the roof of this temple Praxiteles carved for the The-r

bans many of the twelve labours of Hercules. What he

has omitted, are the birds called Stymphaljdes, and the

purification of the Elean land: and instead of these he

has represented the wrestling of Hercules with Antæus,

But Thrasybulus the son of Lycus, and those Athenians,

who together with him dissolved the oppressive govern­

ment of the thirty tyrants (for they descended from Thebes

for this purposes dedicated in the temple os Hercules
