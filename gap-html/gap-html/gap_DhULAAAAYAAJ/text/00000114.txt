soo THE DESCRIPTION

in it there is an ancient temple of Adonis and Venus.

They fay, that in this temple there is a necklace which

was given by Harmonia at first; but that it came to be

called the necklace of Eriphyle, because she received

it'as a cist from her husband. Afterwards the sons of

Phegeus dedicated it at Delphi. But how it came to these,

we have shewn in our account of the Arcadian affairs.

And last of all it was taken away by the Phocæan ty­

rants. However, it does not appear to me, that the neck­

lace, which the Amathufians possess in the temple of

Adonis, belonged to Eriphyle, as this necklace in Ama-

thus is composed of green stones set in gold 5 and Homer,

.in the Odyssey, says that the necklace which was given to

■Eriphyle was made of gold:

■ "There Eriphyle weeps, who lonselv sold

-Hor lorJ, her honour, for the lust of gold."

And yet Homer was not ignorant that there are various

kinds of necklaces. For in the speeches of Eumæus to

Ulysses, before the arrival of Telemachus from Pylus, there

are the following lines:

"An artist to my father's palace came,"

With gold and a:nber chains, elab'rate frame.''

And among the gifts which Penelope received from the

suitors, he fays that Eurymachus gave her a necklace:

A necklace rich with gold, with amber gav,

That sliot effulgence like the solar rav,

Eurymachus presents.-

But he does not fay that Eriphyle received a necklace varied

with gold and stones. So that it is probable that this

sceptre is the only thing among all these that was made
