Page 131. The verses of Homer.] The island of Æoluj is de­

scribed in the beginning of the tenth book of the Odyssey.

Page 133. The Sibyl Herophile.] Hermias the philosopher,

in his MS. Commentary on the Phædrus of Plato, has the follow­

ing remarkable passage respecting this Sibyl. The reader may

find the original of it in my translation of the Phædrus, page 52.

"The particulars which are reported about this Sibyl are so won­

derful, that they liave the appearance of fables. But indeed there

were many Sibyls, all of whom adopted the fame life, and all of

them, perhaps through a certain rational cause, were called Sibyls:

these appellations from a certain communication and recollection;

since this very Erythræan Sibyl, of whom Plato now speaks, was

from the first called Herophile. But they report that she called

every one by his proper name as soon as she was born, that she

likewise spoke in verse, and that in a short time she arrived at"the

perfection of the human species."

period remarkable for their impiety; and the fame gigantic spirit

rules in the breasts of their descendants of the present day. In­

deed the French seem at present to have greatly surpassed their

ancestors in impiety; for it is no where asserted that the ancient

Gauls were professedly a nation of atheists, though they acted in

an irreligious manner. However, these effeminate, volatile, su­

perficial and lawless people, who after throwing off the barbarjG
