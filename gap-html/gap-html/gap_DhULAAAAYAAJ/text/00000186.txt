i72 THE DESCRIPTION

turning to the left hand, you will see an inclosure, which

contains the tomb of Neoptolemus the son of Achilles,

to whom the Delphi perform funeral sacrifices every year.

On ascending from this monument, you will see a stone

of a moderate size. This they anoint with oil every day,

They are of opinion respecting this stone, that it was

jyven to Saturn as a substitute for the infant Jupiter, and

that he afterwards threw it up by a vomit. On leaving

this stone, and directing your course aa if back again to

earth, and causes the women in the adytum of the god

to possess prophetic powers. They add, that the founÂ­

tain was denominated from one of the nymphs about

Parnaflus.
