122 THE DESCRIPTION

Theflalians, Ænianians, Magnetæ, Maleenses, Phthiotsc,

Dorienses, Phocenses, and the Locrians that border on

Phocis, and dwell under the mountain Cnemis. But when

the Phocenses plundered the temple, and in the tenth

year when the war was finished, the Sunedrion of the

Amphictyons was changed: for the Macedonians were

admitted into this assembly; and the nation of the Pho­

censes, and the Doric Lacedæmonians ceased to become

members of it: the former on account of their sacrilegious

conduct 5 and the latter because they assisted the Pho­

censes in war, and were for this obliged to pay a fine.

But when Brennus led an army of Gauls to Delphos, the

Phocenses fought against them with an alacrity superior

to that os the other Greeks, and in consequence of this

again partook of the assembly of the Amphictyons, and

recovered all their ancient dignity. Afterwards the Em­

peror Augustus was willing that the Nicopolitans at

Actium should likewise partake of this assembly. He

therefore ordered the Magnetæ, Maleenses, Ænianæ, and

Phthiotx, to join themselves to the Thessalians; and

transferred the suffrages of these people and the Dolopians

to the Nicopolitans. The Amphictyons in my time were

thirty in number. Nicopolis, Macedonia, and the Thes­

salians, had each of them two. Among the Bœotians

(for these formerly were a part of Thessaly, and were

called the Æolenses) there were two. So likewise the

Phocenses and the Delphi had each of them two; and the

ancient Doric land had one. The Locri too, who are called

Cbiolie, ard those who are beyond Eubcca, send each of

them one: and the Eubccenses and the Athenians each

fend one. The cities, indeed, Delphos and Nicopolis fend

members to the assembly of the Amphictyons, and are pre­

sent
