m THE DESCRIPTION

Anthedonius, daubs, or thick. In this city the women

are said to have feasted Tereus with the body of his son $

and the polluted tables of mankind originated from hence.

But the hoopoop, into which they fay Tereus was changed,

is a'bird not larger than a quail, and has wings on its

head which resemble crests. It is a wonderful circum­

stance that, in this country, swallows neither breed, nor

lay eggs, nor build their nests on the roofs of houses.

The Phocenses fay, that when Philomela was changed

into a bird, she flew from the country of Tereus through

fear of him. But the Daulienscs have a temple of Minerva,

in which there is an ancient statue of the goddess. It

likewise contains a more ancient wooden statue, which

they fay Procne brought from Athens. A place called

Thronius forms a part of the Daulian land: and- in this

place there is an heroic monument, dedicated to that hero

from whom the people here derived their origin. Some

fay, that this hero was Xanthippus, a man of no obscure

reputation in warlike affairs: but others are of opinion,

that he was Phocus the son of Ornytion, and the grand­

son of Sisyphus. This hero they venerate every day; and

after they have slain the victims which they sacrifice to

him, they pour the blood through a hole into the se-,

pulchre, and consume the entrails in the fame place.

There is an eminence in Daulis, by which you may

ascend to the summits of mount Parnassus. This road is

longer, but not so difficult as that at Delphos, which

leads to the fame summits.
