of the soul, prevents it from beholding the nature of gods and

men. And here it may not be improper to observe, that,

through ignorance of ancient theology, a very beautiful passage

in the fifth book of the Iliad has not been understood either by

ttuy of the translators or commentators on Homer that I am

acquainted with. Thii passage is in the beginning of the fifth

book, and consists of tlie 4th and 7th lines, which are these;

These lines, literally and truly translated, are as follow:

"She (that is Minerva) enkindledan unwearied fire from hit

helmet and his shield." And, "Such a fire did Jhe enkindle from

his head and his shoulders." But all the translators render these

lines, as if unwearied fire in the first line and fire in the second

were nominatives, i.;nl not accusatives. I am indebted to Pro-

elus in Plat. Polit. p. 353. tor this information.

Page 204. Three eyes-] These three eyes in the statue of Ju­

piter were doubtless designed as symbols of those three deities,

Jupiter, Neptune, and Pluto, of whom we have given a copious

account in a former note: r>nd these eyes being fixed in one

body, signify the profound union of these deities with each other.

The verse of Homer cited by P:.usania3 is in the Iliad, lib. viii.

Page 2 12. Nor.ier.J Iliad. 4. ver. 193. For what reason Pau-

sanias concludes that Æsculapius i3 called a god by Homer in

these verses, I cannot possibly conjecture. It cannot be from

the epithet xfi.vu.vi Homeless; for this is given by Homer to men,

as to Chalcas in the first book of the Iliad, and to Ulysses in the

Odyssey: and there is no other word which seems in the least to

favour the construction of Pausanias.
