OF GREECE. 33

guardian of Laodamas the son of Eteocles. I know, too,

that at present the Thebans choose as the annual priest of

Apollo Ismenios, a boy illustrious for his origin, and of

great beauty and strength. This boy is called Daphnophoros,

because ht is crowned -with laurel. But I am not certain

whether all the boys that are crowned with laurel dedi­

cate a brazen tripod to Apollo. It appears to me, that

all are not obliged to do this by law; for I did not fee

many tripods dedicated here. The wealthier fort of these

boys however dedicate tripods: and among these, that

which Amphitryon dedicated,withHercules on it crowned

with laurel, is the most illustrious, both for its antiquity

and the renowH of the person by whom it was sent as an

offering. Beyond this temple of Ismenian Apollo you will

see a fountain, which they say is sacred to Mars: and

they add, that a dragon is stationed here by Mars as

the guardian of the fountain. Near this is the tomb of

Caanthus, who they fay was the brother of Melia, and

the son of Ocean ; and who was sent by his father to seek

his sister that was forcibly taken away. But when he

sound that (he was in the power of Apollo, and that in con­

sequence of this he was not able to take her away, he had

the boldness to set on fire the grove- of Apollo, which

they call Ismenion; and for this action, as the Thebans

fay, the god flew him with his arrows. They fay, too, that

Apollo had two sons by Melia, Tenerus and Ismenius;

and that Apollo endowed Tenerus with a prophetic power,

but the river was denominated from Ismenius. However,

prior to the birth of Ismenius this river was called

Ladoa.
