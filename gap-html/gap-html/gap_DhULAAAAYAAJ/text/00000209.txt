nymph Tithorea, who was one of those nymphs that, ac­

cording to the ancient poets, are produced from other

trees, and particularly from oaks. But the affairs of the

Tithoreans, one age prior to mine, were changed by the

dæmon to a worse condition. At present, however, the

apparatus of a theatre, and the inclosure of a more an­

cient forum, remain. The particulars in the city, which

mostly deserve to be mentioned, are a grove, temple, and

statue of Minerva; and a monument in remembrance of

Antiope and Phocus. In my account of the affairs of the

Thebans, I mentioned the insanity of Antiope, through

this sepulchre, and that of Zethus and Amphion among

the Thebans. And such are the particulars which de­

serve to be mentioned in this town; for there are not any

besides these. A river runs near the city of Tithorea;

and the inhabitants of the city descend to its banks, and

draw water from it. The name of the river is Cachales.

The temple of Æsculapius is about eighty stadia distant

from Tithorea: and they call this god Archagetas, or the

primæval divinity. He is honoured by the Tithoreans,

and by the rest of the Phocenfes. Within the inclosure

there are habitations for suppliants and the servants of the

god: but in the middle of it there is a temple, and a stone

statue which has a beard, and is about two feet in altitude.

On the right hand of the statue there is a bed. They are

of opinion that they ought to sacrifice all kinds of yictims

to the god, except goats. At the distance of about forty
