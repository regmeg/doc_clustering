52 THE DESCRIPTION

Grecian tongue, but in a Barbaric dialect. After yoa

have passed beyond the mountain Ptous, you will arrive at

Larymna, which is a maritime city of the Bœotians. They

fay that it was thus denominated from Larymna, the

daughter of Cynus. But I (hall relate who were her more

lake, whose profundity commences from its very margin:

and the mountains which are above the city afford wild

They fay that Athamas dwelt in this place. The river

Cephiffus pours itself into this lake. This river commences

from Lilæa among the Phocenscs, and affords a passage

for sliips to Copse, which is a small city situated near the

lake, and which is mentioned by Homer in his catalogue

of the sliips. In this city there are temples of Ceres,

Bacchus, and Serapis. The Bœotians too fay, that for­

merly other small cities, Athenx and Eleusis, were inha­

bited near this lake, which were destroyed during the win­

ter season by the overflowing of the lake. But the fish in

the lake Cephiffis are in no respect different from the silh
