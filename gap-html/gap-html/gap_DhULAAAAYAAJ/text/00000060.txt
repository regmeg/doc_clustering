have fins under their breast and belly, like those of th6

dolphin, instead of feet. I have likewise seen the

Æthiopian bull, which they call rhinoceros, because a

horn projects from the extremity of its nostril, and

another small one under it: but it has no horns on

its head. I have seen too the Pæorian bulls, whose bodies

are rough in every part, but particularly in the breast

and chin. But the Indian camtls resemble leopards in

their colour. There is a wild beast called alee, which is

of a species between a stag atid a camel. This animal is

acquainted with, which can neither be hunted nor fore­

seen at a distance by the human species: but the dæmon

drives these into the Hands of the hunter, while he is en­

gaged in pursuing other wild beasts. They fay that it

smells a man at a great distance; and, after smelling him,

hides itself in chasms and profound caverns. Hunters,

therefore, when they have surrounded plains or mountain

thickets with their toils, so as that they are certain of

catching all the aninials within the circumference of

their toils, catch among the rest the alee. But if it hap­

pens that this animal is not in the part in which they

have fixed their toils, they are unable to take it by any

stratagem whatever.

With respect to that wild beast which Ctesias, in his

history of the Indians, fays, is called by them martiera,

but bj the Greeks androphagos, or the devourer of man, I am

persuaded that it is no other than the tiger. This animal,

he fays, has a triple row of teeth in one of its jaws, and

stings in the extremity of .its tail, with which it defends

itself when attacked near, and hurls them like arrows

against its enemies at a distance. For my own part, I do
