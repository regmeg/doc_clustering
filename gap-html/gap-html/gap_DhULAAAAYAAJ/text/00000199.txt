OF GREECE. 185

through her garment to her neck. You may conjecture,

that she holds a necklace in that hand which is concealed

in the folds of the garment. Elpenor is represented above

Eriphyle and Ulysses kneeling, and holding a sword over

a ditch. The prophet Tiresias approaches to the ditch;

and after Tiresias, Anticlea the mother of Ulysses is seen

sitting on a stone. Elpenor is covered with a mat made

of bulrushes, after the manner of sailors, instead of a gar­

ment. Theseus and Pirithous fit on a throne below Ulysses:

and of these Theseus holds the sword of Pirithous, and

his own sword, in both his hands; but Pirithous looks at

the swords, and seems to be indignant that he has no

weapons to accomplish his daring enterprise. PanyaGs

aflerts in his verses, that Theseus and Pirithous were not

bound to the throne like captives, but that a stone grew

to their skin, and served instead of bonds. Homer in both

his poems mentions the celebrated friendship of Theseus

?nd Pirithous. For Ulysses thus speaks to the Phæacians;

"Th' illustrious Theseus' and Pirithous' sliades,

Fam'd sons of gods, I then perhaps had seen."

And in the Iliad, Nestor, when he exhorts Agamemnon

and Achilles to lay aside their enmity, thus speaks:

"A godlike race of heroes once I knew,

Such as no more these aged eyes shall view! ,

Lives there a chief to match Pirithous' fame,

Dryas the bold, or Ccncus' deathless name;

Theseus endued with more than mortal might,

pr Polyphemus like the gods in fight?"
