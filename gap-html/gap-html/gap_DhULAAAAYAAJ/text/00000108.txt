94 THE DESCRIPTION

tives of this place. The oracle is above the grove iri 4

mountain, and is inclosed with a wall of white stone,

whose circumference is very small, and whose altitude is

not more than two cubits. Two obelisks are raised on

this wall, which, as well as the zones that hold them to­

gether, are of brass. Between these there are doors: and

within the inclosure there is a chasm of the earth, which

was not formed by nature, but was made by art, and is

excavated in according proportion with consummate ac­

curacy and (kill. The shape of this chasm resembks that

of an oven. Its breadth, measured diametrically, may be

conjectured to be about sour cubits. Its depth does not

appear to me more than eight cubits. There are not

steps to its bottom: but when any one designs to descend

to Trophonius, they give him a ladder, which is both

narrow and light. On descending into this chasm, be­

tween its bottom and summit there is a small cavern, th«

breadth of which is about two spans, and its altitude apj

pears to be about one span.

He, therefore, who descends to the bottom of this

chasm lays himself down on the ground, and holding

in his hand sops mingled with honey, first of all places

his feet in the small cavern, then hastens to join his knees

to his feet; and immediately after the reft of his body

contracted to his knees, is drawn within the cavern, just

as if he was hurried away by the vortex of the largest

and most rapid river. But those that have descended td

the adytum of this place are not all instructed in the

secrets of futurity in the fame manner. For one obtains

this knowledge by his sight, and another by his hearing:

but all return through the fame opening, and walk back*

wards as they return. They fay no one that descended
