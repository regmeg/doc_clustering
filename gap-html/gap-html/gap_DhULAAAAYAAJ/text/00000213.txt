OF GREECE. 199

Patron, incited all those that were capable of bearing arms

to rife, and, having vanquished the Macedonians, com­

pelled them to abandon the city, and accede to the condi­

tions which he proposed. And the Lilæans, in remem­

brance of so great a benefit, dedicated his statue at

Delphos.

But in Lilæa there are a theatre, a forum, and a bath.

There are likewise two temples, one of Apollo, and the

other of Diana. The statues in these temples are in an up­

right position, were made by Attic artists, and are of Pen-

telican stone. They fay that Lilaea was one of the Naiades,

that she was the daughter of Cephissus, and that from her

the city was denominated. The fountains of the river are

in this place; and the river, rises from the earth, not at

all times quietly, but for the most part, and particularly

in the middle of the day, with a loud noise, like the roar­

ing of a bull. For three parts of the year, viz. in' spring,

summer, and autumn, Lilæa is a temperate region; but

the mountain Parnassus prevents it from being similarly

temperate in winter. A place called Cbaradra, which is

situated on a precipice, is about thirty stadia distant from

hence. The inhabitants of this place labour under a great

scarcity of water. The river Charadrus supplies them

with all the water they have; and this river, after run­

ning through shelving places, pours itself into the Cephis*

sus. It appears to me that the town Charadra was de­

nominated from this river. But the Charadrse have two

altars in the open air sacred to two of those who are called

heroes. Some are of opinion that these heroes are the

Dioscuri; and others fay that they are heroes belonging

to this country. The land too about the Cephissus is by

far the best in all Phocis; and is naturally adapted to the
