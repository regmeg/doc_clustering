SECOND VOLUME. 319

So likewise Virgil, in his 4th Æneid, describes this uriJufua,

or advent of Apollo:

As when from Lycia, bound in wintry frost,

Where Xanthus'streams enrich the smiling coast,

Vbe beauteous Pbabus in bigb pomp retires,

And bears in Delos the triumphant choirs,

The Cretan crowds and Dryopes advance,

And painted Scythians round his altars dance:

Fair wreaths of vivid rays his head infold,

His locks bound backward, and adorn'd with gold;

The god majestic moves o'er Cynthus' brows,

His golden quiver rattling as he goes.

The adytum too of temples was the place in which the divi­

nities appeared to the eyes of such as were properly prepared for

so transcendent a vision, as the following passage from Plotinuj

evinces (Ennead. 9. lib. ix. p. 770.).—wbttij t»{ h; to ho-u t*u aJu-

entered into the most interior parts of the adytum of a temple,

leaves all the statues in the temple behind him (which on his de»

pasture from the adytum will first present themselves to his view

after the inward spectacle), and then associates not with a statue

or an image, but with the thing itself; viz. with a divine nature."

From all which the truth of what Pscllus asserts, in the passage

already cited from his book On Dæmons, " that magic formed the

last part of the jtictrdotal oJJHcc among the Greek* " is I presume

perfectly apparent.

Page 157. That of the moon has horns on its head.'] These

horns were doubtless those of a bull. For the moon, in the Or­

phic hymn to her, is called hull-horned; and Porphyry De Antro

Nymph, informs us, that the ancient priests of Ceres called the

moon, who is the queen of generation, a bull.
