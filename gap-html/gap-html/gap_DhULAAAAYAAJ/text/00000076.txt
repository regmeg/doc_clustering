6t THE DESCRIPTION

to mankind. They add, that the pastures here even ie-

bilitate the venom of serpents; so that those who are fre­

quently bit by serpents in this part, escape the danger

with greater ease than if they were of the nation of the

Psylli, or had discovered an antidote against poison. Other­

wise the venom of the fiercest of serpents is both destruc­

tive to men, and all other animals. The nature of the

pastures too contributes in no small degree to the strength

of the venom. For I once heard a Phœnician fay, that in

the mountainous part of Phœnicia, the roots that grow

there render the vipers more fierce. The fame person too

farther added, that he saw a viper pursue a man who fled

to a tree for shelter, aud that the viper blew its venom

against the tree to which the man had escaped, and by

this means caused his death. With respect to those vipers

in Arabia which take up their residence among balsam

trees, I know that something very different from what I

have above related happens, and this is as follows: The

balsam tree is nearly of the fame size as a sprig of myrtle;

and its leaves are like those of the herb sweet-marjoram.

Vipers take up their residence about these plants; and are

in some places more numerous than in others: for the

juice of the balsam tree is their sweetest food; and they

are delighted with the (hade produced by its leaves.

When the time therefore arrives for gathering the juice

of this tree, the Arabians come into the sacred grove,

each of them holding two twigs. By shaking these they

put to flight the vipers: for they are unwilling to kill

them, because they consider them as the sacred inhabitants

of the balsam. And if it happens that any one is wounded

by a viper, the wound resembles that which is rhadc by

iron, but is not attended with any dangerous conse­

quences:
