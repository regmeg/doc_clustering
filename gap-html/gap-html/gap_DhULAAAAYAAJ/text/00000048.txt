34 THE DESCRIPTION

success chose Epaminondas for their general, with the

free consent of the Bœotian præfects. Alexander, there­

fore, perceiving that the command was transferred to

Epaminondas, had not the boldness to come to an engage­

ment, and voluntarily dismissed Pclopidas. 'But during

the absence of Epaminondas, the Thebans drove the Or-

chomenians from their country. This violence Epami­

nondas bore indignantly, and said that the Thebans would

hot have dared to act in this manner if he had been

present.

In the mean time, as no other Bœotian governor was

chosen, Epaminondas led his army again to Peloponnesus,

and vanquished the Lacedæmonians near Lechæus; and

together with them the Pelienenscs from among the

Achaians, and of the Athenians, those which had been

led by Chabr'as. It w as an established custom among the

Thebuns to take a ransom for their prisoners, except such

as were Bœotians •, for these they condemned to death.

But Epaminondas having taken a small city of the Sicyo-

nians called Fhœbia, and which contained the greatest

panel the Bœotian exiles, enfranchised them on their pay­

ing down a certain sum of money ; at the same time call­

ing them by the names of unlerent countries, just as they

came into his mind. However, when he came to Man-

tinea with his army, and was then victorious, he was

(lain by an nthenian: and among the Athenians in a

picture of an equestrian battle, a man is represented slay­

ing Epaminondas, and the writing under him shews that

he is GrylluS the son of Xenophon. This was the Xeno-

phon that attended Cyrus in his expedition against Arta-

xerxes, and who led the Greeks back again to the sea.

On the statue of Epaminondas elegies are inscribed, which
