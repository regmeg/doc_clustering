z6o NOTES ON THE

souls, such as heroes, beneficent dæmons and angels, and of the

gods themselves. But the allotments of angels, dæmons and

heroes are suspended from those of the gods, and possess a more

various distribution: for one divine allotment comprehends many

angelic allotments, and a still greater number of such as are dse-

moniacaL For multitude is every where suspended from one prin­

ciple. Arid as in essences, powers and energies, progression*

from these generate a kindred multitude; so with respect to

allotments, such as are first transcend in power, but are dimi­

nished according to multitude, as being nearer the one father of

the universe, and the one total providence which he contains;

but such as are second to these possess a subordinate power, and

an increased multitude.

Such then being the general particulars respecting the theory

of allotments, the next thing to be considered is, that the allot­

ment of a divine nature, whether celestial or sublunary, is an

unrestrained government, and a providential energy about the

subjects of its government. By unrestrained government I meia

an exemption from all passivity, and from any tendency towards

or alliance with subordinate natures: for every thing divine it

at the fame time every where aud no where. It is every where,

considered as illuminating all things with its own ineffable light *

and it is no where, considered as exempt from all the properties

of the natures which it illumines. The fame too must be un­

derstood, in an inferior degree, of those beneficent natures that are

the perpetual attendants of the gods: for the energy of these also

is unrestrained, but not in that transcendant manner in which it

is possessed by the gods. In the third place, the allotments of the

gods and their attendants are perpetual: for immutability

is the essential property of a divine nature, and consequent*

ly must be communicated to that which perpetually attends

divinity, and exerts a beneficent energy. But notwithstand­

ing this immutability of better natures, yet in order to the
