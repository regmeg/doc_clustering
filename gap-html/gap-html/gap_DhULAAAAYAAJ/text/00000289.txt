of the hymn to Amphietus Bacchus. And in short, the greater

part of the hymns will be found to-have either the word telete

in them; or to invoke the respective divinities to bless the mystics,

or initiated persons. Thus the conclusion of the hymn to Hea­

ven entreats that divinity to confer a blessed life on a recent

mystic:

KXtiS' aBuftn \*%t onat pupi neQ/xUti—

the conclusion of the hymn to the Sun, "to hestoiv a pleasant

life on the mystics:" and in a similar manner most of the rest.

Farther still, Demosthenes, in his first Oration against Arifto-

giton, has the following remarkable passage: xat tut swrapouliilo*

*' Let us reverence inexorable and venerable Justice, who Or­  
pheus our instructor in the most holy teletai, fays, is seated by the

throne of Jupiter, and inspects all the affairs of men." Here

Demssthenes you fee calls the mysteries most holy, as well as Pro-

clus: and I think we may conclude with the greatest confidence

from all that has been said, that he alluded to the hymn to Justice,

which is among the Orphic hymns, and to these very lines:

O/xucc Aix»; piKiru vrct^isS^xio;, *y\cu>uQQ$w

*HkJ fyrni ataxies ftfi 5p°»o» »fo» t£n, j

the throne of king Jupiter, and from her celestial abode beholds

the life of mortal men."

Page 112. Homer calls these daughters, &c.~\ Paufanias doubt­

less alludes to Homer's hymn to Ceres: but these names are not

to be found in the hymn at present, owing to an unfortunate

chasm in a part of the hymn where they were mentioned.

Page 114. The poet Pamphus.~\ Pamphus was an Athenian

contemporary with Linus, and is said to have composed poems

and hymns prior to Homer.
