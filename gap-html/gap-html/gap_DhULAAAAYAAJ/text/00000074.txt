60 THE DESCRIPTION

statue of Love for the Thespians; and prior to him Praxi­

teles made one of Pentelican stone. With respect to the

stratagem which Phryne employed, in order to discover

the favourite statue of Praxiteles, this I have elsewhere

related. They say, that this statue of Love was first moved

out of its place, by the Roman emperor Caius. It was

afterwards sent back to the Thespians by Claudius v and

again brought to Rome by Nero, where it was destroyed

he used to nick-name in derision; and Nero acted very

there isa Venus and a statue of Phryr.e, both of stone, and

the works of Praxiteles. In another part of the city there

is a temple of Venus Mclainis, or the black • there a'e be­

tides a theatre, and a forum, well worthy of inspection.

Here likewise there is a brazen statue of Hefiod: and not far

from the forum there are a brazen statue of Victory, and a

temple of the Muses not very large. In this temple there

are small statues of stone. The Thespians too have a temple

of Hercules •, the priestess of which retains her virginity as

long as fiie lives. They fay that this arose from the fol­

the fifty daughters of Thestius except one, in one night:

and this one, who was unwilling to be connected with

him, was chosen by him as his priestess, but with this re*
