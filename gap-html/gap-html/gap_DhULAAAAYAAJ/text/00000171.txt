But it appears, that some of those who guarded the

Thermopylæ left their station. For, indeed, none but the

Lacedæmonians, Thespians, and Mycenæans waited the

event of the war. Again, the following Grecian cities

sent a guard to Thermopylæ against the Barbarians, who

marched an army from the extremities of the ocean against

Greece. The Bœotians sent ten thousand heavy-armed

soldiers, and five hundred horse. These were under the

command of four leaders called Bceotarchs, viz. Cephisso-

Megarenses: and Megareus led the horse of these people.

seven thousand, and of their light-armed ninety. These

were commanded by Polyarchus, Polyphron, and Lacratej.

Calippus the son of Mocrocles led the forces of the Athe­

Aristodemus the Macedonian was sent as a commander

of the auxiliary forces, by king Amigonus; and Telesar-
