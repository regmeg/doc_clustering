U4 THE DESCRIPTION

with these dead bodies, and buried them. There is a public

road steep and difficult to a light-armed soldier, which

leads from hence to Dclphos. Many things indeed are

reported of the Delphi, and particularly concerning the

oracle of Apollo. For they fay that this oracle is the

most ancient of any on the earth, that Daphne was chosen

by Earth, priestess of the oracle, and that she was one

of the nymphs that inhabit mountains.

her own mouth ; but that Neptune had Pyrcon for his in­

terpreter. The verses respecting this affair are these:

"From her own mouth Earth utter'd prudent words,

But Pyrcon was illustrious Neptune's priest."

They fay, that afterwards Earth gave her part of the oracle

to Themis; but Themis to Apollo; and that Apollo re­

ceived the other part from Neptune, in return for which

he gave Neptune the island Calaurea which is situated be­

herds who once happened to come to the oracle, became

divinely inspired from the vapour of the earth, and pro­

phesied through the influence of Apollo. But Phemonoe

arrived at the highest degree of celebrity, as being the

first prophetess of the god, and the first that fang an

hexameter verse. Boeo, a woman who was a native of

Dclphos, and who composed a hymn for the Delphi,

says, that both others that came from the Hyperboreans,

and Olen, built a place for the oracle of Apollo j and that,
