o& THE DESCRIPTION

But among the Chæronenses there are two trophies,

which were raised by the Romans and Sylla, when they

vanquished Taxilus and the army of Mithridates. Philip,

however, the son of Amyntas, neither raised any trophy

at Chxronca, nor for any victories which he gained over

cither Greeks or Barbawans. For it was not an established

custom with the Macedonians, to leave trophies as monu­

ments cf their victories. It is said too by the Macedo­

nians, that Caranus, when he reigned iii Macedonia, having

vanquished in battle Cisseus, who governed the country

bordering on the Macedonians, raised a trophy after the

manner of the Argives. But they add, that a lion rushing

from Olympus, threw down and destroyed the trophy.

That Caranus was conscious he had not acted prudently,

because by raising this trophy he had occasioned an irrecon-

cileablc enmity with his neighbours; and that afterwards

neither Caranus nor any of his successors raised a trophy,

that t'^.ey might at some suture time attract to themselves

the benevolence of the neighbouring people. Alexander

confirms the truth of this account, because he neither

raised a trophy for his victories over Darius, nor for his

conquest of the Indies. Near this city there is a com­

mon sepulchre of those Thebans that fell in the engage­

ment against Philip. There is no inscription on the tomb,

but a lion stands on it, which may be supposed to signify

the great vehemence os these men in fight. But it ap­

pears to me that there is no inscription on the sepulchre,

because the Dæmon did not permit the consequences of

thdv courage to be such as might be expected. The

Chx'.onc^ins venerate, above all die gods, the sceptre which

Homer says Vulcan made for Jupiter. This sceptre

Hermes
