were dedicated by Cadmus. Hence their opinion, who

assert that the Cadmus who came to Thebes was au

Egyptian, and not a Phœnician, may be confuted by the

very name given to this statue of Minerva: for this god­

dess is called Siga in the Phœnician, and not Sais, as in.

the Egyptian tongue.

The Thebans too farther report, that where the forum

of the tower now stands, the house of Cadmus formerly

stood. Hence, they shew the ruins of the bed-chambers

of Harmonia and Semele, into which last, even at present,

men are not permitted to enter. According to the Greeks,

the Muses celebrated the nuptials of Harmonia with songs:

and there is a place in the forum here, where they fay the

goddesses fang. It is also said, that together with the

thunder which descended into the chamber of Semele, a

piece of wood fell from heaven, which Polydorus adorned

with brass, and called Cadmean Bacchus. Near this there

is a statue of Bacchus, which Onassimedes made entirely

of brass; for the statue of Cadmus was made by the sons

of Praxiteles. Here too there is a statue of Pronomus the

piper, who allured many by his harmony. Before his

time there were different pipes, for the Dorian, Lydian,

and Phrygian measures; but he sirjl invented pipes adapted to

every kind of harmony, and was the first that played all the

different measures at once on one pipe. It is alto said, that he

wonderfully delighted the spectators in the theatres, by

the gesticulations of his face, and the motion of his whole

body. His songs are yet extant which he composed for

the Chalcidenses by the Euripus, in honour of Delos. The

Thebans therefore have here placed a statue of this Pro-

pomus, and of Epaminondas the son of Polymnis.
