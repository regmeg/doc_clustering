272 NOTES ON THE

verses of Homer alluded to by Pausanias are these, which may

be found in the 23d book of the Iliad:

Sperchius! whose waves In mazy errours lost

Delightful roll along my native coast!

To whom my father vow'd at my return,

These locks to fall, and hecatombs to burn.

I only add, that the obscure and intricate mode of expression em*

ployed by Pausanias in the present passage, and which he so fre­

quently adopts, led me into an error in the translation of it, from

not recollecting at the time the verses of Homer alluded to. I beg

the reader, therefore, to correct the passage as follows: "that Pe-

leus vowed the hair of Achilles to the river Sperchius, for his safe

return from Troy."

Page 109. Mild Jupiter.'] It appears that Jupiter Misubiut,

ot mild Jupiter, is the fame with that power called the Damont

in the Orphic hymns: for in the hymn to him he is expressly

called y.u\\yun A.a, mild Jupiter. It appears too, that this deity

is the fame with the Janus of the Romans. For in the hymn

just cited there is the following line:

i. e.

<*In thee, the keys of joy and sorrow are carried."

And Janus, it is well known, wasi represented as a porter.

Scaliger indeed, in the translation of this line, expressly as­

signs two epithets'to this divinity, which belong only to Janus,

L e. Patulcius and Clufius, the power that opens and shuts.

Lxtitix, mxrori, Vatuk'm', Clufiui idem es.

Indeed, that Jupiter is the fame with Janus, is indisputably

clear, from the following verse of a MS. hymn in my possession,

of Proclus, which is entitled Tjxwf xoitec, or a common hjmu:
