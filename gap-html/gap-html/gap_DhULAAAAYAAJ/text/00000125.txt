OF GREECE. m

In the same place, viz near the chasm os the torrent,

there is a sepulchre of Tityus: and the circumference of

the heap of earth which forms his tomb is about one

third of a Radium. But of Tityus it h said in the

Odyssey!

"There Tityus large and long, in fetters bound,

O'erspreads nine acres of infernal ground.1'

They fay, that this verse does not allude to the magnitude

of Tityus, but to the place in which he lies buried, and

which is nine acres in extent. But Cleon, one of those

Magnesians -that dwell about Hermus, fays that things

of a very wonderful nature must be incredible to those

who, during the whole course of their life, never beheld

any thing which surpasses the conceptions of the vulgar.

He adds, that he is persuaded both Tityus and others

were really as large as they are reported to have been.

For, fays he, I once went to Gades, and sailed with all

the company of my attendants from that island, agreeably

to the command of Hercules. But afterwards returning

to Gades, I found a marine man thrown up on the shore,

who had been burnt by lightning, and whose magnitude

Wa> not less than five acres.

But Df.ulis is about seven stadia distant from Panopeus.

This city does not contain many inhabitants; but those

which it does contain, surpass all the Phocenses in mag­

nitude and strength of body. They fay, that the city

was denominated from the nymph Daulis, who was the

daughter of Cephissus. It is also said by others, that the

place where the city stands was formerly full of trees,

and that the ancients called Things dense or dose, daula.

Hence, fay they, Æschylus calls the beard of Glaucus

Anthe- -
