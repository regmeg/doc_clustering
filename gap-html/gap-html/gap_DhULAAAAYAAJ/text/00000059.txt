seize all small vessels, till the Tanagrians placed on the

shore bowls of wine. For Triton, allured by the smell of

this, drank it, was overpowered by sleep, and fell head­

why his statue is without a head. But they are of opinion

that, because he wa» seen intoxicated, he was slain by

Bacchus.;

of the fame form with the upper shells of shell-fish. They
