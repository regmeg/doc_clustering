NOTES ON THE THIRD VOLUME. 343

and Mars. For Venus is the cause of all the harmony and ana­

logy in the universe, and beautifully illuminates the order and

communion of all mundane concerns. But Mars excites the

contrarieties of the universe, that the world may exist perfect

and entire from all its parts. The progeny, therefore, of these

two divinities must be the rerum concordia discors, the concord­

ant discord, or harmony of the sublunary world.

Page 19. Have seven gates."] The names of these seven gates

should be read as follows: Elc3ræ, Proctid*, Nciltt, Crcntx,

Hypjijls, Ogygts, Omoloides. Nonnus, lib. 5. Dionys. informs

us, that these seven gates were raised agreeably to the number

and order of the seven planets; so that the first gate was assigned

to the Moon, the second to Mercury, the fourth to the Sun,

under the appellation of Electra, a surname of Phaethon, the

fifth to Mars, the third to Venus, the sixth to Jupiter, and the

seventh to Saturn. By this is meant, that the properties of the

seven planets are participated by the sublunary world. For as

Cadmus is the deity of the sublunary region, the city Thebes^

which he is said to have built, and in which, according to the

fable, he resided, must be an image of the body of the sublunary

world.

Page 27. Pipes adapted to every kind of harmony.] In one of

my notes on the Cratylus of Plato, I have (hewn from a pas­

sage out of the MS. Commentary of Proclus on the first. Alci-

biades, that the ancients far excelled the moderns in the practical

part of music. This passage I mall here transcribe, as a com-

ment on the words of Pausanias before us. «» oj9ai ToÆai mt
