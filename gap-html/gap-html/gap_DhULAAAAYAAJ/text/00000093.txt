sacred enclosure of the temple, and that Minerva ap­

peared to her, invested with a robe, in which there was

the head of Medusa: that Iodamia, as soon as she beheld

it, became a stone; and that on this account, a Woman

places fire every day on the altar of Iodamia, and fay*

thrice in the Bœotian tongue, that Iodamia lives, and calls

for sire. The remarkable particulars which Coronea con­

tains, are an altar of Mercury Epimelius in the forum*

and an altar of the Winds. A little below these there is

a temple of Juno, and in it an ancient statue, which was

made by the Theban Pythodorus. This statue holds Sirens

in one of its hands. For they fay, that the daughters of

Achelous were persuaded by Juno to contend in singing

with the Muses; and that the Muses, being victorious,

* plucked off the wings of the Sirens, and made crowns  
"from them. The mountain Libethrius is about forty stadia

distant from Coronea. In this mountain there are statues

of the Libethrian Muses and Nymphs. There are like­

wise two fountains here, one of which they call Libethrias,

and the other Petta, or a rock. These fountains resemble

the breasts of women, and water resembling milk ascends

from them. To the mountain Laphystion, and the grove

of Jupiter Laphystius from Coronea the distance is twenty

stadia. There is a stone statue of the god in this grove:

and they fay, that when Athamas was about to sacrifice

Phrixus and Helle here, the sons of Jupiter sent a ram

whose wool was golden, upon the back of which they

escaped. Above this grove there is a place called Her­

cules Cbarops, or the grey-eyed: and the Bœotians fay,

that Hercules ascended here, dragging up the dog of

Hades.
