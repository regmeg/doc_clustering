CHAP. XXXII.

that dwell in Creusis, which is a liayen of tho

Thespians, have no public building or statue which de足

serves to be mentioned : but in the house of a private per足

son-in Creusis there is a statue of Bacchus, which is made

of plaster, and adorned with pictures. But the passage bjr

sea to Creufis from Peloponnesus is winding and stormy.

The promontories which run in(o the sea, give such a

curvature to the shores, that ships cannot fail in a direct

line, and the winds blow violently from the neighbouring

mountains. On sailing from Creusis, not upwards but

near Boeotia, you will fee the city Thisbe on the right

hand. And in the first place there is a mountain near

the sea. When you have passed beyond this you will

see a plain, and after this another mountain, in the bottom

part of which there is a city. In this city there is a temple

of Hercules, and in it a stone statue in an upright po足

sition. They celebrate .here a festival, which they call

Heracleia. Nothing would hinder the plain which lies here

between the mountains from becoming a lake, through

the great quantity of water in this part, if they did not

raise a strong bank through the middle of the plain, turn

the water every year to places beyond the bank, and cul足

tivate the other parts cf the plain. They fay that the

nymph Thisbe, from whom the city is denominated, was

a native of this place. On sailing from hence you will

see a small city near the sea, which is called Tipha. There

js a temple of Hercules here, in which they celebrate a

festival
