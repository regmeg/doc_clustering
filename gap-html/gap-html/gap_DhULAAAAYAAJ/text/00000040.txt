THE DESCRIPTION

colossal statues of Minerva and Hercules, of Pentelican

stone, and made by Alcamenes. A gymnafium and sta­

dium too of Hercules are contiguous to this temple. But

above the stone Sophronister there is an altar of Apollo,

who is called Spondios: and this altar is raised from the

asties of victims. Divination from omens is here esta­

blished ; which I know the Smyrnæans use beyond all the

Greeks. For in the outward inclosure of their walls they

have a temple, raised for the purpose of receiving omens.

J. HE Thebans too, in ancient times, sacrificed bulls to

Apollo Polios, or the hoary. But it once happened in this

festival, that when the time for slaying the victim was at

fiand. and those that were sent for the bull did not

come as they were expected, the sacrificers met with

a car drawn bv two oxen, one of which they sacri­

ficed to the gcd; and from this circumstance they after­

wards thought proper to sacrifice labouring oxen. The

following circumstance likewise is related by the Thebans:

When Cadmus came from the Delphi to Phocis, he fol­

lowed an ox as his guide. This ox was bought of the

herdsmen of Pelagos, and hail on each of its fides a white

spot resembling the full moon. It was necessary, there­

fore, that Cadmus and his army, by the command of an

oracle, should fix their residence in that place in which

she ox when weary laid itself down to rest. This place

the Thebans exhibit even now : and in it there is an altar,

jn the open air, of Minerva, and a statue, which they fay
