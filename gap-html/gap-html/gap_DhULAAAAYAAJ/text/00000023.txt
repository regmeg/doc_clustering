OF GREECE, 9

is nearly equal to that brazen statue of Minerva which

the Athenians dedicated in their tower from the Mara-i

thonian spoils. Phidias too made this statue of Minerva

for the Platæenfes. In the temple there are pictures

painted by Polygnotus, viz. Ulysses destroying the suir

tors; and the expedition, prior to this, of Onatas to the

Argive Thebes. These pictures are in the vestibule of

the walls. At the foot of the goddess there is a statue of

Arimnestus, who was the general of the Platæenfes in

the engagement against Mardonius; and, prior to this,

in the battle at Marathon. Among the Platæenfes too

there is a temple of Ceres Eleufinia, and a sepulchre of

Leitus. This Leitus was the only one of all the Bœotian

commanders, that returned home from the Trojan war.

But Mardonius, and the horse which he commanded,

corrupted the fountain Gargaphia, because the army of the

Greeks which stood opposite to them drank the water of

this fountain. Afterwards, however, the water was pu­

rified by the Platæenfes. As you proceed from Platæa to

Thebes, you will fee the river Peroe. They fay that

Peroe was the daughter of Asopus. But before you pass

over the Asopus, on turning by the side of the river to

the lower parts of the country, and travelling to the dis­

tance of about forty stadia, you will arrive at the ruins of

Scolus. Among these ruins there is an imperfect temple

of Ceres and Proserpine, with half statues of the god­

desses. Even now the Asopus separates the land of the

Flataeenscs from that of the Thebans.
