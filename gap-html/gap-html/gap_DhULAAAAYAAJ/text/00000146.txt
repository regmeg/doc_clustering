i32 THE DESCRIPTION

arc baths of salubrious water, and of a more temperate

nature: for the water in other parts is not adapted for

bathing, through its great heat. But to return to the

gifts in the temple, the Thebans and Athenians have

dedicated here treasuries, in consequence os success in

war. I do nos however know, whether the Gnidians

built their treasury in consequence of any victory, or for

the purpose of shewing the prosperous condition of thei*

affairs. For the Thebans dedicated treasuries on account

of the victory which they gained at Leuctra, and the

Athenians for their success at Marathon. But the Cleonæi

being afflicted with a pestilence in the fame manner as

the Athenians, by the admonition of the Delphic oracle,

immolated a goat to the rising fun, and, when they were

by this means freed from their malady, sent a brazen

goat to Apollo. After these follow the gifts of the Poti-

dæatæ in Thrace, and of the Syracusans. These last sent

a treasury to the temple, on account of the great victory

which they obtained over the Athenians: but the Poti-

dicatæ sent a treasury as a testimony of their piety to the

god. The Athenians too have dedicated a porch, from

the spoils which they took from the Peloponnesians and

their Grecian allies- In this place likewise the orna­

ments belonging to the extremities of ships are dedicated,

and together with them brazen shields. The inscription

on these mentions the cities from which the Athenians

sent the first fruits of their spoils, viz. Elis, Lacedæmon,

Sicyon, Megara, the Pellenenses, the Achaians, Ambracia,

Leucas, and Corinth They sacrifice to Theseus for these

naval victories, and to Neptune whom they call Qrios. This

inscription, too, as it appears to me, celebrates Phormiq

the son of Asopichus, and his illustrious achievements.
