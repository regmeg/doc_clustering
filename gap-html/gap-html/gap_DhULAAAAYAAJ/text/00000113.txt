Hermes received from Jupiter, and gave to Pelops; Pe-

Jops left it to Atreus; Atreus to Thyestes; and ,from

Thyestes it came to Agamemnon. This sceptre too they

but every year the person to whose care this sacred sceptre

is committed, places it in a building destined to this pur­

pose; and the people sacrifice to it every day, and place

near it a table full of all kinds of flesh and sweetmeats.

made by Vulcan, but in reality they have no such chelt

to sliew. In Cyprus there is a city called Amathus j and
