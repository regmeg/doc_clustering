i9+ THE DESCRIPTION

roots, carry them with case through the narrowest: roads.

The cavern Corycium, however, surpasses in magnitude

those we have mentioned; and the greatest part of it may

be descended into, and this without a light. The roof is

sufficiently elevated above the ground: and the cavern

contains many fountains of water; but a still greater

quantity of water trickles from its top ; so that the vestiges

of drops of water may be seen throughout the cavern.

The inhabitants of Parnassus are of opinion, that this

cavern-is particularly sacred to the Corycian nymphs and

to Pan. But from hence to the summits of Parnassus, the

road to a man lightly clothed is difficult. For the sum­

mits of this mountain are above the clouds; and the Thy-

iades, agitated with divine fury, sacrifice on these summit*

to Bacchus and Apollo. Tithorea too is about eighty

stadia distant from Delphos, to one who is travelling

through Parnassu*. The road is not entirely mountain­

ous •, but that part of it which may be passed through by

carriages is said to be longer by some stadia. As to the

name of the city, I know that Herodotus, in that part of

his history in which he gives an account of the irruption

of the Persians into Greece, differs from what is asserted

in the oracles of Bacis. For Bacis calls these people Ti-

thorenscs; but Herodotus fays, that when the Barbarians

invaded this country, the inhabitants fied to the summit

of Parnassus; and he calls the city Neon, and the summit

of Parnassus Tithorea. It appears, therefore, that all the

country was at first called Tithorea; but that in process

of time, when the inhabitants collected themselves into

one city, that which was once called Neon came to be

denominated Tithorea.

The natives fay, that this name was derived from the

nymph
