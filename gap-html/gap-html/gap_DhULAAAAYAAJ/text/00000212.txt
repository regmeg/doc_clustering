But another road from Tithoraca leads to Ledon.

This was formerly reckoned a city; but at present the Le-

dontii have abandoned it, through the imbecility of their

by Demetrius, the inhabitants were obliged to accede to

conditions of peace, and to admit a guard belonging to

the enemy within their walls. Nor were they freed from

this bondage, till one of the natives, whose name was
