OF GREECE. 115

Olen was the first who prophesied at Delphos, and de­

livered oracles in hexameter verses. The following are

the verses of Boeo:

"Here Pagafus, Agyicus the divine,

From th' Hyperboreans, Phœbus, rais'd to thee

A building, for thine oracle renovvn'd.''

And after she has enumerated other Hyperboreans, to­

wards the end of the hymn, she mentions Olen:

"Olen, the first who Phœbus' will disclos'd,

The first who verses of the ancients fung.''

If we follow tradition, however, women alone were the

first interpreters of oracles.

They farther report, that the most ancient temple of

Apollo was raised from the laurel-tree; and that the

branches from which it was built were cut from that tree

which is at Tempe. The form of this temple resembled

that of a cottage. But the Delphi say, that the other

temple of Apollo was raised by bees from wax and wings,

and was sent by Apollo to the Hyperboreans. There is like­

wise another report concerning chis affair, that a Delphos

man, whose name was Pteras, built this temple, and that

from this circumstance the temple came to be called by

the name of its artificer. From this fame Pteras, too, a

Cretan city, with the addition of one letter, was denomi­

nated Apterxi. I cannot, however, be induced to be­

lieve that this temple was framed from a herb Pteris, or

fern, which grows on mountains, and this while the herb

was yet green. But with respect to the third temple, the

report that it was built of brass, is by no means wonder­

ful, since Acrisius made a brazen bed-chamber for his

daughter; and even at present there is a temple of Mi-
