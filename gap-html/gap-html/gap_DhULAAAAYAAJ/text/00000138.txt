124 THE DESCRIPTION

water os Castalia, which is sweet to the taste. They say

that a woman, a native of this place, gave a name to the

fountain; but some are of opinion, that it was denomi­

nated by a man whose name was Castalius. Panyashs,

however, the son of Polyarchus, fays, in the verses which

when, on stated days, they throw into the fountain of

Cephissus cattle belonging to their country, and other

things according to established rites, they are again seen

in the river Castalia. The city of the Delphi in every

part rises to a steep: and the sacred inclosure of Apollo

has the fame situation with the city. This temple is very

large, and stands in the upper part of the city: and pas­

sages in a continued series cut one another through the

temple.
