lind, came to Sardinia under the command of Iolaus.

These built the city Olbia, which is also called Ogrylle,

either after the name of some one of the Attic towns,

or because Gryllus partook of this expedition. Even at

present therefore there are certain places in Sardinia

inhabitants. After the destruction of Troy, others of the

junction of the two parties. Many years after this,

all, or at least left but a very few alive. But the Trojans

on this occasion fled to the elevated parts of the island,

incited to sedition, passed over to Sardinia, and having

seized on the mountains, fixed their residence in them.

These by the inhabitants of Sardinia are denominated from
