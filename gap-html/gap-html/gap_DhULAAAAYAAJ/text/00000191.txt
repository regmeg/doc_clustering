ground, holding the wooden image of Minerva, which she

tore from its basis, when Ajax drew her from her sup­

plications ac the altar. The sons of Atrcus likewise arc

painted with helmets on their heads. But on the fliield

of Menelaus there is a dragon, viz. the one that appeared

as an omen during the sacrifice at Aulis. These administer

the oath to Ajax. Opposite to trie horse, NeoptoJemus is

beheld near Nestor, flaying Elassus. This Elassus, whoever

he was, resembles a man nearly expiring. Neoptolemus

too strikes with his sword Astynous, who has fallen on his

knees, and who is mentioned by Leseheus. Tolygnotus,

indeed, is the only one of the Greeks that has represented

Neoptolemus still continuing to flay the Trojans; and his

design in this was, that the whole picture might cor-*

respond to the tomb of Neoptolemus. Homer, indeed,

every where calls Neoptolemus the Ion of Achilles; but

the Cyprian verses testify that he was called Pyrrhus by

Lycomedes, and that the name of Neoptolemus was given

to him by Phœnix, because Achilles was very young when

he first engaged in war.

An altar too is painted here, and a little boy embracing

the altar through fear. On the altar there is a brazen

coat of mail. At present the shape of such coats of mail

as this is very rare; but they were used in former times.

In thi3 coat of mail there are two pieces of brass, one of

which serves to fasten it to the breast, and the parts about

the belly, and the other defends the back: the anterior

part of this coat of mail they call gualcti, and the hinder

part prosegon. It appears too to be a sufficient defence for

the body without a shield. On this account, Homer re­

presents the Phrygian Pharcys fighting without a shield,

because he used a guakthqrax, or holkvi coot sf mail. I be-
