that in this place he would be concealed with security. A

wolf, however, rushed on the boy in his place of conceal­

ment-, but a strong dragon winding himself round the ves­

sel, defended him from the assaults of the wolf. The father

some time after this came to fee his son, and supposing

that the dragon had destroyed him, hurled his dart at the

animal, and, together with the dragon, flew his son. But

when he understood from certain shepherds that the boy

was slain by his own hands, and that the dragon had been

the benevolent guardian of his son, he raised a funeral

pile for the dragon and the boy in common: and they say

that the place retains vestiges of this funeral pile even at

present, and that the city was denominated Ophitea from

the dragon. In this city, that which principally deserve*

to be inspected is an adytum, in which they perform the

orgies of Bacchus. The entrance to this adytum is visible,

but no statue belonging to it is apparent. It is said by the

Amphiclcenses,that this god predicts to them future events,

and affords them remedies against diseases. And the dis­

eases, indeed, of the Amphicleenses and neighbouring

cities are healed through the information imparted to

them in dreams. But the priest of the adytum possesses a

divining power, and uses a divine afflatus. Tithronium

is about fifteen stadia distant from Amphiclea. This

town is situated in a plain, and does not contain anything

which deserves to be mentioned. From Tithronium to

Drymæa there is a distance of twenty stadia. But where

the road which leads from Amphiclea to Drymxa joint

with that which leads from Tithronium, there are a grove

and altar of Apollo, which belong to the Tithronenses.

There is likewise a temple here, but it does not contain

any statue. On directing your course to the left hand in
