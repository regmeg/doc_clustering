196 THE DESCRIPTION

stadia from this temple of Æsculapius, there is an inclosure"?

and in it there is an adytum sacred to Ifis. This is the most

holy of every thing which the Greeks consecrate to this

goddess. For the Tithoreans neither think it proper to

take up their residence here, nor to suffer any to enter the

adytum, except such as the goddess Ifis informs them by

a dream she thinks proper to admit. The subterranean

gods in the cities above the Mæander act in just the fame

manner; for they exhibit in dreams the images of those

persons who they are willing should be admitted into

the adyta.

But the Tithoreans celebrate the Paneguris of Ifis twice

a year, viz. in spring and in autumn. And on the third

day prior to each of these public solemnities, those that

are permitted to enter the adytum purify it after a certain

secret manner; and always bring into the fame place the

relics of the victims which were sacrificed in the former

solemnity, and bury them there. This place where they

bury the relics, is, as far as I can conjecture, about two

stadia distant from the adytum. And these are the cere­

monies which they perform on that day. On the follow­

ing day they erect pedlars tents from reeds and other

materials which they happen to meet with. And on the

last of the three days, those who assemble in these tents

fell slaves, and cattle of every kind, together with appa­

rel, silver, and gold. After the middle of the day, too,

they turn their attention to the sacrifice. And then the

more affluent sacrifice oxen and stags; but the poorer

fort geese, and the birds called Meleagrides. But they

do not think proper to sacrifice swine; nor do they em­

ploy on this occasion sheep or goats. Such victims as

they sacrifice they send into the adytum, where a funeral
