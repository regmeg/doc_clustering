From this circumstance Jupiter came to be called Savi­

our. They have besides a statue of Bacchus, another of

Fortune, a third of Hygia, and a fourth of Minerva; by

CHAP. XXVII.

But the Thespians venerated, from the first, Love be­

yond all the gods: and they have a most ancient statue of

this divinity, which is nothing more than a rude stone. I

do not however know who it was that instituted this high

veneration of Love among theThefpians. The Pariani, too,

who dwell about the Hellespont, and who originated from

Ionia, and migrated hither from Erythræ, but at present

are in subjection to the Romans, venerate this divinity no

less than the Thespians. The multitude are of opinion,

that Love is the youngest of the gods, and the son of

Venus. But the Lycian Olen, who composed the most

ancient hymns for the Greeks, fays in his hymn to Lucina,

that Lucina is the mother of Love. And Pamphus and

Orpheus, who flourished after Olen, have composed hymns

to Love, that they might be fung by the Lycomedæ during

the celebration of the mysteries. I likewise once spoke with

a torch-bearer of the Eleusinian mysteries, and through

his means read these hymns of Pamphus and Orpheus, of

which I shall make no farther mention. Hesiod, indeed,

or at least the author of the 1 heogony, I well know,

says, that Chaos was first generated, afterwards Earth,

and then Tartarus and Love. But the Lesbian Sappho

sings many things of Love, which by no means harmonize

with each other, Lysippus afterwards made a brazen

statue
