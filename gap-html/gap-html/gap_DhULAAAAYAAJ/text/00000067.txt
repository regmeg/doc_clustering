which are found in other lakes. The eels, however, which

are found in it are very large and sweet. On proceeding

from Copæ,on the left hand, at about the distance of twelve

stadia, you will arrive at Holmones : and from Holmones,

Hyettus is distant about seven stadia. These are now, as

they were at first, nothing more than villages; and it ap­

as well as the Athamantian plains. With respect to

Hyettus, and Holmus the son of Sisyphus, I (hall relate

the temple there are statues in an upright position os Apollo

and Diana. Cold water flows here from a rock: and near

this fountain there is a temple of the Nymphs, and a small

grove in which trees of every kind are planted. On pro­

ceeding from Crytones, after you have passed over the

mountain, you will arrive at the town Corsea. Under

this town there is a grove of planted trees, which are for

see the river Platanius pouring itself into the sea. And
