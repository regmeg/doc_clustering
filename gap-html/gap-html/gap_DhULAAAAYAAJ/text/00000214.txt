so* THE DESCRIPTION

plantation of trees, and the sowing of seeds of every kind;

,and abounds with excellent pastures. Hence they pay

particular attention to the cultivation of this part of the

country. And hence there are some who think that Ho­

mer in the following verse, by the Parapotamii, or inha­

bitants of the river, does not allude to a city, but to those

who cultivate the land near the Cephissus:

"And those who near divine Cephissus dwell.'*

This opinion, however, may be confuted, both by the

history of Herodotus, and the particulars which are re­

lated of the Pythian victories. For the Amphictyons first

instituted the Pythian games, and the Parapotamian Æch-

mseas was the first that in these games conquered boys

in boxing. In like manner Herodotus, when he enume­

rates the cities of the Phocenscs which Xerxes burnt,

reckons among them the Parapotamians. These people,

however, were not restored by the Athenians and Bœo­

tians, but were obliged through imbecility, and want of

money, to betake themselves to other cities. The ruins,

indeed, of this city do not at present remain, nor is it

even known where it formerly stood.

From Lilæa there is a road of about sixty stadia in

length, which leads to Amphiclea. The inhabitants of

this place have corrupted the name of the city: for He­

rodotus, following the most ancient reports, calls it Ophi­

tea: and the Amphictyons, when a decree was passed

fpr destroying the cities of the Phocenses, gave it the name

pf Ophitea. But the natives relate the following particu­

lars concerning this city: A certain powerful man, sus­

pecting the stratagems of his enemies, placed his son in a

vessel sijch as is used for the reception of liquor^ trusting
