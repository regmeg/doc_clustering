With respect to the prosperous or adverse events ot

their wars, I have found the following to be the most

remarkable particulars. They were vanquished by the

Athenians in that battle, in which they assisted the Plstæ-

cnses, who fought for the boundaries of their land. They

were a second time top vanquished at Platæa by the same

Athenians, in consequence of seeming to prefer the friend­

ship of Xerxes to that of the Greeks. The common

people, however, were not culpable in this particular:

for at that time an oligarchy wa9 established among the

Thebans, and not that form of administration which was

natural to their country. If therefore the sons of Pisistra-

tus had then tyrannized over the Athenians, there can be

no doubt but that the Athenians themselves would have

been attached to the Persians, and on this account would

have been culpable as well as the Thebans. Afterwards,

however, the Athenians were vanquistied by the Thebana

at Delius, in the country of the Tanagræans: and Hip­

pocrates the son of Ariphron who commanded the Athe­

nian army was slain, together with a greEt part of his-

forces. But the Lacedæmonians, immediately after the

departure of the Mede, were upon friendly terms with

the Thebans, till the Peloponnesians warred on the Athe­

nians. This war however being finished, and the fleet of

the Athenians dissolved, the Thebans not long after, to­

Lacedæmonians: but being vanquished in a battle about

Corinth, and in Chæronea, they afterwards obtained at
