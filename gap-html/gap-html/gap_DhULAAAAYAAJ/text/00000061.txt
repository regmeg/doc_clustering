OF GREECE. 47

not believe that tins account of the animal is true, but

that the Indians have been induced to fabricate it, through

vehement dread of this wild beast. For they are deceived

with respect to its colour, because the tiger, when it is

beheld in the fun, appears to be red, and of a colour similar

to that of the sun. Or this deception may have arisen,

from the swiftness of the beast, ot from its agility in turn­

ing its body when it is not running, which is so great,

that its colour, particularly -if beheld at a distance, cannot

be ascertained. Indeed, I am of opinion, that whoever

travels to the extremities of Africa, India, or Arabia, and

is desirous of finding such animals as are produced in

Greece, will, in the first place, discover that some of them

are wanting; and, in the next place, will find others

which vary in certain particulars from those in Greece.'

For man is not the only animal which varies in his form in

a different air, and a different land, but other animals arc

subject to the same variety. Thus the Libyan asps arc of

the fame colour with those in Egypt; but in Æthiopia

they are black as well as the men. Hence we ought nei­

ther to believe in every report indiscriminately, nor yet

refuse our assent to the existence of other things, merely

because they are rare. I have never indeed seen winged

serpents; but I am persuaded there Sre such animals, be­

cause a Phrygian once brought into Icnia a scorpion,

which had wings similar to those cf a locust.
