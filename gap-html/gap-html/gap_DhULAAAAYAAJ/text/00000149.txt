OF GREECE. i$5

The ErithrSfei (for these people contend about Herophile

the most eagerly of all the Greeks) shew a mountain called'

Corycus, and in it a cavern, in which they- fay Herophile

was born. They farther add, that her parents were a shep­

herd, Theodorus, a native of their country, and a nymph

who was' called Ida: and that the nymph was thus deno­

minated, for no other reason than because men at that

time called places thick-planted with trees, Mai. But the

Erythræi do not rank among the oracles of Herophile, the

verse respecting Marpeflus, and the river Aidoneus. One

Hyperochus a Cumæan writes, that after Herophile a

woman of Cuma belonging to the Opici, used to deliver

oracles in the fame manner as Herophile, and that this

woman was called Demo. >

The Cumæans, however, cannot produce any oracles

of Demo; but they shew a stone water-pot in the temple

of Apollo, in which they say the bones of this Sibyl are

deposited. After Demo, the Hebrews beyond Palsestine

rank among the number of prophetic women, Sabbe,

whose father they say was Berofus, and whose mother

was Erymanthe. Some, however, call this Sibyl a Baby­

lonian, and others an Ægyptian. But Phaennis, who was

the daughter of a man that reigned over the Chaones,

and the Peleæ among the Dodonæans, prophesied indeed

from a divine power, but were not denominated Sibyls.

As to the age and oracles of Phaennis, the former may

be known by inquiry, and there is no difficulty in obtain­

ing the latter: for she lived in those times in which An-

tiochus, having taken Demetrius prisoner, seized on his

kingdom. But they fay that the Peleades were prior to Phe-

monoe, and were the first women that fang these verses:

"Jove was, Jove is, and tvill be, mighty Jove!

Earth gives us fruits, hepee call on mother Earth."
