OF GREECE. 175

Lescheus relates in his verses, that when Troy was

taken, Æthra escaped, and came to the camps of the

Greeks; that she was there known by the sons of Theseus,

and that Demophon requested her in marriage 9s Aga­

memnon. That he indeed was willing to gratify Demophon,

but that he said he would not accomplish their desires, till

he had gained the consent of Helen. A herald therefore

being sent to Helen, found her disposed to the match.

Hence, in the picture, Eurybates appears addressing Helen

on account of Æthra, and delivering to her the message

of Agamemnon. Trojan women too are represented in

this picture in the habit of mourning captives. The first

of these is Andromache with an infant at her breast.

Lescheus fays, that this infant was thrown from a tower,

not indeed by the decree of the Greeks, but through the

private hatred of Neoptolemus, who ordered him to be

put to death. Medesicaste likewise is painted here, who

was one of the bastard daughters of Priam, who, accord­

ing to Homer, dwelt in the city Pedæum, and was mar­

ried to Imbrius the son of Mentor. Andromache and

Medesicaste are veiled: but Polyxena is painted with her

hair platted after the manner of virgins. Poets sing, and

the pictures which I have seen at Athens, and Pergamus

which is a city above Cakus, in which die calamities of

Polyxena are painted, evince, that she was slain at the

tomb of Achilles. Polygnotus too has painted in the

fame picture, Nestor with a hat on his he.id, and a spear

in his hand. A 'horse rolling in the dust is seen near

him. The ground on which the horse lies is the sea shore j

and the pebbles on the sliore are represented. The re­

maining part of the ground does not appear to resemble

the sea shore. ,
