when contrasted with the multitude of mankind, who front

being merged in the darkness of matter lose all reality of es­

cording to the Orphic hymns, are Eunom'ia or Equity, Dice or

Justice, and Eircne or Peace, concerning which three divinities I

and causes them through proportion to conspire into equality

and consent: but of the Graces they conjoin with this divinity

Thalia, because she gives perfection to the ever-flourishing lives

which they contain. But they place Peace over the sublunary

region, because this divinity appeases the war of the elements:

but of the Graces they associate with this divinity Euphrofyne,
