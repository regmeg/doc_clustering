ed from its proper energy, On this account Heroes are called

ijjxiSioi Demigods, as having only one of their circles illuminated

by the gods. Such of these, therefore, as have the circle of

lameness unfettered, as are roused to an elevated life, and are

moved about it, according to a deific energy—these are said

to have a god for their father, and a mortal for their mother,

through a defect with respect to the opinionative form of life.

But such, on the contrary, as energize without impediment ac­

therefore, has dominion, the divine cause of illumination is (aid

specimens of magnificent, vehement, and divinely-inspired ener­

to practical virtue, that even when in Hades, Homer represents

him as desiring a union with body, that he may aflist his father.

While on the contrary Minos and Rhadamanthus, who were

heroes illuminated by Jupiter, raised themselves from generation

to true being, and meddled with mortal conctrns no farther dun

Theseus therefore, who as well as Hercules was a hero, who

energized principally aicording to an intellec ual life, uid v\ o
