mvengers of actions. They swear on the altars os these god­

desses, and never violate the oath which they have thu#

taken. This temple is near the mountain Tilphussius. But

in Haliartus there are temples in which there are no

statues, because the temples are without roofs. To what

divinities these were dedicated I have not been able to

learn. The river Lophis flows through the Haliartian

land. It is said, that this country at first was very dry,

owing to its being totally destitute of water, and that one

of the principal inhabitants went to Delphos to inquire

by what means water might be found: that the Pythian

deity answered him, that he must flay the first person he

met on his return to Haliartus; and that he happening

to meet first of all with Lophis the son of Parthenomenes,

immediately struck the youth with his sword. That Lo­

phis yet breathing ran round the place in which he was

wounded •, that wherever his blood fell on the ground

there water ascended; and that from this circumstance

the river was called Lophis.

Alalcomenæ is a village by no means large, and is

situated at the extremities of a mountain not very lofty.

They fay, that this place was denominated from a native

Alalcomenes, who was the nurse of Minerva. But, ac­

cording to others, it was called after Alalcomenia, who

was the daughter of Ogygus. At some distance from this

village a temple of Minerva stands in a plain; and in it

there is an ancient statue of ivory. Sylla, indeed, was

guilty of many cruelties towards the Athenians, and his

conduct, was very different from the manners of the Ro­

mans. His behaviour too towards the Thebans and Or-

chomenians resembled his conduct towards the Athe­

nians: and from the Alakomenians he took away this

statue
