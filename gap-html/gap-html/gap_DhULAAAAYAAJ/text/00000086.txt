7* THE DESCRIPTION

mount Helicon is the river Lamusy which is not large i

and in the borders of the Thespians there is a plaoe called

Hedonacon, which contains the fountain of Narcissus.

They fay that Narcissus beheld himself in this fountain }

that he did not know he was in love himself; and that

he died through this love by the side of the fountain. To

be in love indeed with a shadow, and not to know the

difference between a man and the shadow of a man, is

stupidity in the extreme. But there is another report

concerning Narcissus, which is less known thrn the former

one -, and this is, that he had a twin sister, who perfectly

resembled him in her whole form, that her hair and dress

were similar to those of Narcissus, and that they used to

go out together to hunt. That Narcissus fell in Jove with

this sister ; and that slie happening to die before hini, he

used to come to this fountain, in which, when he saw

his own shadow, without at the same time perceiving that

it was his own, he found some mitigation of the torments

of his love, by imagining that it was the image of his sister.

It appears to me, however, that the earth produced the

flower Narcissus, prior to this circumstance; and mÂ»

opinion is confirmed by the verses of Pamphus. For he

fays, that many years before the Thespian Narcissus,

Proserpine the daughter of Ceres was forcibly taken

away by Pluto, as she was playing and gathering flowers j

and that she was deceived not by violets, but by the

parcissus.
