j56 THE DESCRIPTION

learnt from report, how injuriously the Gauls had treated

the Thessalians at that time. It was therefore the unani­

mous opinion both of individuals and cities, thar they

must either perish, or subdue the enemy. Any one who

is so disposed, may easily enumerate those Grecian cities

which opposed Xerxes at Thermopylæ, and those which

took up arms against the Gauls. For the Greeks that

marched against the Mede were these: The Lacedæmo­

nians, who were not more than three hundred, under the

command of Leonidas; five hundred of the Tegeatæ, and

as many from Manlinea. One hundred and twenty Or-

chomenians were sent from Arcadia: a thousand from the

ether cities of Arcadia: eighty from Mycena: and two

hundred from Phlius. The Corinthians sent twice this

number. There were seven hundred from Bceotia: and

from Thespia andThcbes four hundred. Five hundred of

the Phoccnses guarded the pafcges of mount Oeta. And!

such was the number of the forces that assembled on this

occasion, according to the genera! opinion cf the Greeks.

For Herodotus does n&t mention the number of the Lo-

crians who live under the mountain Cnemis; but only

fays, that the Greeks assembled together from all their

cities on this occasion. We may however conjecture the

number os these very near the truth. For the Athenians in

the battle at Marathon opposed the enemy with not more

than nine thousand men, in which, those whose age ren­

dered them useless for the purposes of war, and servants

were ranked. It follows, therefore, that the band of

Locrians which came to Thermopylæ, could not at the

most amount to more than six thousand men. And hence,

the whole army must have amounted to eleven thousand

two hundred men.
