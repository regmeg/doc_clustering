OF GREECE. 71

stadia, you will see a fountain, which is called the fountain

of the horse. They say, that the horse of Bellerophon

made this fountain by striking the earth with his hoof.

But the Bœotians that dwell about Helicon have a tradi­

tion among them, that Hesiod wrote nothing besides the

poem entitled Works and Days; and from this they take

away the introduction to the Muses, and fay that she

proper beginning of the poem is that part which speaks

of Contentions. They shewed me too a leaden table near

the fountain, which was almost entirely rotten through

age, but on which the Works and Days of Hesiod was

written. Their opinion, however, who ascribe many works

to Hesiod, is very different from this. And, according to 1

these, he composed a poem On Women; The Great Eoea *

The Thtogony; Verses on the Prophet Melampus; The De­

scent of Theseus with Pirithous to Hades; The Exhortation of

Chiron, viz. relative to the instruclidti of Achilles; and the

poem called Works and Days.

The same persons too assert, that Hesiod was instructed'

jn divination by the Acarnanes: and, indeed, a poem of He-

Cod On Divination is extant, which I have read, together1

with The Narrations of Prodigies, which are at the end of it.

Contrary reports likewise are circulated about the death

of Hesiod. For though it is universally agreed, that the

sons of Ganyctor, Ctimenus, and Antiphus, fled to Mo­

lucca from Naupactus on account of the murder of

Hesiod, and that through their impiety to Neptune they

were punished there, yet some are of opinion, that He­

siod was falsely accused of having ravished the sister of

these young men, and others assert, that she was ravished

by him. And such arc the different reports which are

circulated about Hesiod and his works. On the top of
