very powerful by sea, drove out all the inhabitants from

Sardinia, except the Ilienscs and Corfi: for steep and for­

The Carthaginians built in this island two cities*

And such are the nations which inhabit Sardinia, and

such the cities into which it is divided. But those parts

These parts, however, afford a very good harbour for

ships; and strong and irregular winds rush from the top»

of the neighbouring mountains into the sea. In the middle

of the island too there are less elevated mountains; but

the air in this part is very turbid and noxious. The reason

of this is the fait which becomes concreted here, and the

heavy and violent south-wind which blows from these

mountains. The northern winds, too, through the lofti­

ness of the mountain* towards the Italian coast, are pre­

vented from refrigerating the ground and the air in sum­

is separated from Sardinia by not more than eight stadia

of sea, and which is on all sides mountainous and elevated,
