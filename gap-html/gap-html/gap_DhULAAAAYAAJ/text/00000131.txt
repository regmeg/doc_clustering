heroes, they fay, that his fathers were, of the gods, Nep­

tune, and of men, Cleopompus; and that from him the

mountain Parnassus and the thicket Parnasiia were deno­

minated. They farther add, that prophecy by the flight of

birds was invented by this Parnassus; but that the city

which he built was destroyed by the rain which fell in

the times of Deucalion: that such men as were able to

fly from the storm, followed the howlings of wolves, and,

with wild beasts for their guides, escaped to the summits

of Parnassus •, and that from this circumstance they called

the city which they built there, Lycorea. There is like­

wise another report different from this, that Lycorus was

the son of Apollo by the nymph Corycia; that from him

the city was called Lycorea: but that the cavern was de­

nominated Coryciun* from the nymph. It is also said,

that Celæno was the daughter of Hyamus the son of Ly­

corus; and that Apollo had by her a son Delphos, from

whom the present name of the city was derived. Others

again fay, that one Castalius, a native of this city, had a

daughter whose name was Thyia, and who was the first

that officiated as priestess to Bacchus, and celebrated the

orgies of the god. That from her, those afterwards that

were agitated with Bacchic fury came to be called Thyiadai.

Hence, they are of opinion that Delphos was the son of

Apollo and Thyia. But, according to others, his mother

was Melæne the daughter of Cephissus.

Some time after this, not only the neighbouring people

called the city Delphos, but likewise Pytho, as is evident

from the verses of Homer, in his catalogue of the Pho-

censes. Those, however, who are much conversant with

genealogies, fay that Py this was the son of Delphos, and

that from him, while he reigned here, the city was denomi-

13 rated.
