bearers of Demetrius, who would not perform any of the

established religious ceremonies, and who did not come

hither for the purpose of consulting divinity, but that he

might enrich himself by carrying the gold and silver from

the adytum. It is also said, that his dead body was thrown

up by a different avenue, and not through the sacred open­

ing.- Other reports are circulated about this man, but

those which I have mentioned appear to me to be the

most remarkable. When the person that descended to

Trophonius returns, the sacrisicers immediately place him

on a throne, which they call the throne of Mnemosyne,

and which stands not far from the adytum. Then they ask

him what he has either seen or heard, and afterwards de­

liver him to certain persons appointed for this purpose,

who bring him to the temple of Good Fortune, and the

Good Dæmon, while he is yet full of terror, and with­

out any knowledge either of himself, or of those that are

near him. Afterwards, however, he recovers the use of hij

reason, and laughs just the fame as before. / write this,

not from hearsay, but from -what I have seen happen to others,

end from -what I experienced myself, -when I consulted the

mracle of Trophinius. All too that return from Trophonius

are obliged to write in a table whatever they have either

heard or seen: and even at present the shield of Aristp-

menes remains in this place, the particulars respecting

which I have already related.
