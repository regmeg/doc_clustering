i3o THE DESCRIPTION

told by a Delphic oracle, that when he should see rain

falling from a serene sky, he would then possess a land

and city. But as he was not able by himself to discover

the meaning os the oracle, and did not consult any inter-r

preter, he sailed with a fleet to Italy. Here having conr

quered the Barbarians, but neither obtaining any land or

city, he recollected the oracle, and was of opinion that

the *god had predicted that which could not be accom­

plished ; as it appeared to Iv m impossible that there mould

be rain when the sky was clear and serene. His wife,

however, when he was in a desponding condition (for

he had returned home), endeavoured to console him by

her endearing officiousness; and as she was once support­

ing his head on her knees, and freeing it from vermin,

through a benevolent concern for the adverse situation of

his affairs she began to weep •, and her tears, as she wept

abundantly, fell on the head of her husband, who then

perceived the meaning of the oracle: for his wife's name

was Æthra, which is the Greek word for a strent Jiy.

On the following night therefore he took Tarentum, a

great and most flourishing maritime city of the Barbarians.

They fay, indeed, that the hero Taras was the son of

Neptune, by a nymph, a native of Tarentum; and that

from the hero both a city and river are denominated

Taras,

Near the sacred offering of the Tarentines, there is

a treasury of the Sicyonians: but there are neither any

riches in this, nor in any other treasury, The Gnidii
