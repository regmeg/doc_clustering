and by this means destroyed himself j and all that fol­

lowed him were punished by the Amphictyons with the

fame kind of death. After the death of Philomelus the

Phocenfes gave the government to Onomarchus t but Philip

the son of Amyntas joined himself to theThebans, and in

the engagement which ensued vanquished the enemy.

Onomarchus therefore flying to the sea, was pierced to

death by the arrows of his own soldiers, who accused his

timidity and ignorance in war, as the causes of their

having been vanquished. And such was the end which

the Dæmon gave to die life of Onomarchus. The Pho­

cenfes, after this, invested his brother Phayllus with the

supreme authority. But he had scarcely begun his reign,

when he saw the following vision in a dream : Among the

gifts sacred to Apollo there was an ancient brazen image

of a man, whose flesh had been consumed by disease, and

whose bones alone remained. The Delphi fay that this was

dedicated by Hippocrates the physician. Phayllus in a

dream saw himself resembling this image; and immedi­

ately after was seized with a tabid disease, which folfilled

the prediction os his dream. In consequence of this event

, taking place, the supreme authority was given to Pha-

læcus the son of Phayllus; but he lost his kingdom

through appropriating the sacred wealth to his own pri­

vate purposes. After this he sailed to Crete with such

of the Phocenfes as embraced his party, and besieged with

a band of mercenary troops the city Cydonia, because the

inhabitants would not pay him the money which'he de­

manded. He lost however in this siege a great part of

his army, and was himself slain.
