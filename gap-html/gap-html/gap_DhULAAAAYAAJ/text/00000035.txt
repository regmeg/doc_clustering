ncr, mercenary troops were sent to the Thebans from the

Phocenses, and by the Phlegyians from Minyas. An en­

gagement therefore taking place nearjfmenus,the Thebans

were vanquished, and fled within their walls. But as the

Peloponnefians were unacquainted with the art of be­

under the influence of anger than the direction of science,

the Thebans flew many of them from their walls, and

afterwards leaving their city, by a sudden incursion broke

the enemy's ranks, and cut to pieces the whole army ex­

cept Adrastiis. This victory however cost the Thebans

dear: and hence, victories obtained with a great loss are

called Cadmean victories. Not many years after this,

those whom the Greeks call Epigonoi, or such as are of

posterior origin, with Thersander for their leader, warred

on Thebes. But it is evident, that not only the Argives,

Meflenians, and Arcadians, joined themselves to their

standards, but that the Corinthians and Megarenses came

to their assistance. The Thebans however were assisted

by the cities bordering on Thebes; and a sharp engage­

ment took place between the two armies near Glisas. Of

the Thebans, many after they were vanquished fled with

Laodamas, and the rest fortified themselves in their city.

And this is the war which is celebrated in verse. Ca-

lænus, making mention of these verses, fays that they were

composed by Homer j and many celebrated persons are of

the fame opinion. Indeed, I consider these verses as next in

excellence to the Iliad and Odyssey. And thus much con­

cerning the war, which the Argives and Thebans waged

for the fake of the sons of Oedipus,
