CHAP. XL.

T*H E Bœotians became acquainted with this oracle, of

which they were before entirely ignorant, by the follow­

ing means: In consequence of a great want of rain for

the space of two years, they sent Speculators from each

city to Delphos: These, imploring a remedy against, the

drought which they laboured under, the Pythian deity

ordered to go to Trophonius in Lebaderij and find relief

from him. But when they came to Lebadea, and could

not find the oracle, one Saon an Acraiphnian, who waS

the oldest of the Speculators, happened to fee a swarm

of bees, and followed them to their hive. Perceiving,

therefore, that they flew into this chasm of the earth, he

followed them, and by this means found the oracle which

he sought. They say, that this Saon was instructed by

Trophonius in all the sacred ceremonies belonging to this

oracle.

Of the works of Dædalus there are two among the

Bœotians ; a statue of Hercules belonging to the Thebans,

and of Trophonius belonging to the Lebadenscs. There

are the fame number of wooden statues in Crete, viz.

Britomartis in Olus, and Minerva among the Gnoflians.

Befideu these, too, they have a representation of the dance

of Ariadne, which is mentioned by Homer in the Iliad;

and this is made of white stone. Among the Delians

likewise there is a wooden statue of Venus not largo, the

right hand of which is decayed through length of rime r

and this statue stands on a square figure instead of feet.-
