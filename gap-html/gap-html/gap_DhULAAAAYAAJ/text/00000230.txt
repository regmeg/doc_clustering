aio" THE DESCRIPTION

distant from Amphissa thirty stadia, and the Inhabitant*

dedicated a shield to Jupiter in Olympia. It is likewise

situated in a lofty place, and contains a grove and altar of

the gods called Meilicbioi, or the mild. To these divini­

ties they perform nocturnal sacrifices: and they consume

the flesh os the victims in the place where they^ sacrifice

before the fun rises. Above the city too there is a grove

of Neptune; and this they call Poseidonion. In it there is

a temple of Neptune ; but it has not at present any statue.

These people therefore dwell above Amphissa.

But Oeanthea borders on the sea, and in the neighbour­

hood of this city is Naupactus. All the other Locrian

cities too, except Amphissa, are in subjection to the Pa-

trenses, who were invested with this authority by the em­

peror Augustus. In this city Oeanthea there is a temple

of Venus j and a little above the city there is a grove of

cypress and pine-trees. In this grove there are a temple

and statue of Diana. But the paintings on the walls are

obliterated by time, so that not one of them remains for

inspection. I conjecture, that the city was denominated

from a woman or a nymph. For as to what pertains to

Naupactus, I know it is reported, that the Dorienses, to­

gether with the sons of Aristomachus, built a sleet in this

place for the purpose of sailing to Peloponnesus; and that

from this circumstance the city was denominated. With

respect to the Naupactians, how the Athenians gave the

.Meslenians, who took up their residence inlthome, when

Sparta was shaken by an earthquake, Naupactus to in­

habit, which they had taken from the Locrians ; and how,

after the slaughter of the Athenians at Ægospotamos, the

Jjaccdxmonians expelled the Messenians from Naupactus
