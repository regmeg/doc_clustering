OF GREECE. 173

the wall the subversion of Troy, and the Greeks sailing to

their native land. Menelaus too is represented on board

his Ihip preparing to depart from Troy; and in the (hip

boys and men are seen standing together. In the middle

«f the (hip the pilot Phrontis is represented distributing

the eontoi, or bargemen's poles. Homer, indeed, among other

things which he makes Nestor fay to Telemachus, repre­

sents him asserting of Phrontis, that he was the son of

Beneath him Ithaemenes is painted,carrying a certain gar­

which is not far from the ship; and Amphialus is seen

taking down another tent.

A boy sits at the feet of Amphialus; but there is no

inscription on him. Phrontis is the only person in this

group that has a beard; and Polygnotus learnt his name

alone from the Odyssey; for it appears to me, that the

other names are his own invention. Briseis too is repre­

both of them Iphis; and they are in the attitude of per­

sons admiring the form of Helen. Helen herself is seated;

and near her stands Eurybates, who, as we may conjec­

ture, was the herald of Ulysses. He is however without

a beard. There are besides two maid servants, Electra
