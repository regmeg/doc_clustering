likewise brought statues to Delphos, viz. Triopas, who

built Gnidus, standing by a horse; Latona, Apollo, and

Diana, piercing Tityus with their arrows, whose body is

the Sicyonians. The Siphnii too made a treasury on the

following account. The island Siphnos had gold-mines ,

and they were ordered by Apollo to fend a tenth of the

produce of these mines to Delphos; in consequence of

which they built a treasury, and sent with it a tenth of

by an inundation of the sea. The Liparæi likewise have

dedicated statues here for a naval victory, which they

gained over the Tyrrheni. These Liparæi were a colony

of Gnidians, who, as we are informed by the Syracufah

JDidymæ, for the purpose of cultivating the land in theso

places.

the promontory on the island. Near the sea here there
