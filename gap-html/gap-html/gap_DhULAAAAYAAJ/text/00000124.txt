no THE DESCRIPTION

is about seven stadia in circumference. While I was sur­

veying it, those verses of Homer respecting Tityus came

into my mind, in which he calls the city of the Pano-

peans Callichoros, or delighting in the dance. I likewise re­

collected, that in the contest for the dead body of Pa-

troclus, he fays, that Schedius the son of Iphitus, and king

of the Phocenses, who was slain by Hector, dwelt in

Panopeus. It appears to me, that the cause of his dwelling

here was his fear of the Bœotians (for Phocis in this part

is very much exposed to the attacks of the Bœotians),

and that he used Panopeus as a place of defence. I was

*iot however able to conjecture why Homer called Pano­  
peus Callichoros, till I learnt the reason from those Athe­

nians who are called Thyades. These Thyades are Attic

women, who every year come to Parnassus, and, together

with Delphic women, celebrate the orgies of Bacchus.

It is an established custom with the Thyades, to form

choirs in the road from Athens, in other places, and among

the Panopcans. Homer, therefore, by the appellation

Panopeus, appears to signify the choir of the Thyades.

In the public road of the Panopeans there is a building

of crude tiles, and in it a statue of Pentelican stone, which

some say is the statue of Æsculapius, and others of Pro­

metheus. These last think their opinion is confirmed

from hence : Near the chasm formed by the torrent, there

are stones of such a magnitude that each is sufficient to

load a cart. These stones are of the colour of clay, yet

not of such clay as is dug out of the earth, but of such

as is found among the gravel of rivers and torrents. These

stones too smell very much like a human body \ and they

say that these are the remains of that clay, from which

the whole race of mankind was fashioned by Prometheus.
