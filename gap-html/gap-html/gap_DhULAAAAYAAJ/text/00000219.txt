CHAP. XXXV.

A MOUNTAINOUS road on the right hand of

Elatea leads to Abæ and Hyampolis. A public road

likewise leads to the fame cities; and this is the road

which brings you from Orchomenos to Opus. On pro­

ceeding therefore from Orchomenos to Opus, and turning

a little to the left hand, you will fee a road which leads

to Abæ. The inhabitants of this city fay that they came

to Phocis from Argos, and that their city was denominated

was the son of Lynceus and Hypermnestra the daughter

of Danaus. The Abæans too have venerated Apollo from

an early period of time, and once possessed an oracle of

the god. But the Persians did not pay the fame venera­

the Romans, through their piety to Apollo, suffered the

Abæans to use their own laws: but the army of Xerxes

burnt the temple in Abæ. The Greeks, however, that op­

posed the Barbarians, did not think proper to rebuild the

temples of the Greeks which the Persians had burnt, that

the ruins of them might remain as perpetual monuments

of hatred between the two nations. Hence, in the borders

of the Haliartians, many half-burnt temples yet remain;

and among the Athenians in the Phaleric road there is a

temple of Juno half burnt, and this is the cafe with a

temple of Ceres in Phalerum. The temple in Abæ ap­
