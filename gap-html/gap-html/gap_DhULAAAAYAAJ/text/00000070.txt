$6 THE DESCRIPTION

circumstances which took place respecting it, piety forbids

me to disclose. The mysteries therefore of the Cabiri

were the gift of Ceres. But when the Epigoni led an

army against Thebes, and Thebes was taken, the Cabiri

being driven from their country were not able for some

time to celebrate these mysteries. Afterwards, however,

they were restored by Pelarge, the daughter of Potneus,

in conjunction with her husband Isthmiades. And then,

indeed, Pelarge initiated persons in these mysteries beyond

the ancient boundaries of the country: but Telondes, and

those of the Cabiri that were restored Jo their native

land, celebrated the mysteries in Cabiræa. By an oracle

too given from Dodona, other honours were decreed to

Pelarge; and a victim big with young was ordered to be

sacrificed to her. Many instances likewise have evinced

that the wrath of the Cabiri is implacable. Far when

certain private persons in Naupactus had the boldness,

to perform the ceremonies established by the Thebans,

they were shortly after punistied for their impiety. Such

too of the forces of Xerxes as, together with Mardonius,

pitched their camps in Bccotia, when they entered the

temple of the Cabiri, either allured by the hope of gain­

ing great riches, or (as it appears to me) through their

contempt of a divine nature, became immediately insane:

and some of them threw themselves into the sea, and

Others hurled themselves headlong from rocks. Thus

again, when Alexander had vanquished the Thebans, and

destroyed all Thebes by. sire, such of the Macedonians as

entered the temple of the Cabiri, because they were upon

hostile ground, were destroyed by thunder and lightning.

So holy has this temple been fj^ni the beginning.
