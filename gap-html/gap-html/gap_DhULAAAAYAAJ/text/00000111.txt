OF GREECE; 9-)

I am persuaded that Ariadne received this statue from

Dædalus, and that when she followed Theseus, she took

it along with her. The Delians fay, that Theseus, when

Ariadne was taken from him, dedicated this wooden statue

of Venus to the Delian Apollo, that he might not by

taking it home with him be reminded of his lost wife,

and by this recollection continually experience new tor­

ments of love. I do not know that any other works of

Dædalus besides these remain. For those works of his

■which the Argives dedicated in the temple of Juno, and

those which were brought to Gela in Sicily from Om-

phace, have all been destroyed by time. The Chxronenses

are next to the Lebadenses. The city of these people was

formerly called Arne: and they fay that Ame was the

daughter of Æolus, and that from her another city in

Theflaly is denominated. They add, that the present name

of the Chæronenses was derived from Chæron the son of

Apollo by Thero the daughter of Phylas : and this is con­

firmed by the author of the poem called the Great Eoeæ,

in the following verses: ,

"In wedlock with Deiphile conjoin'd,

Daughter of lolaus the renown'd,

And in whole person godlike beauties shene,

Phylas, in his august abodes begat

A son mm'd Ippotus, with Thero fair,

In form resembling Phaebe-5 splendid light:

And Thero from Apollo, Chæron bore,

Of mighty strength, and ikill'd the steed to tame." •

It appears to me, too, that Homer knew that Chxronea

was called Lebadea, but that he chose to denominate it

by its ancient name •, in the fame manner as he calls the

African river Ægyptus, and not Nile.
