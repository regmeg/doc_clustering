126 THE DESCRIPTION

not Erato, but Laodamea the daughter of Amyclas, king

of the Lacedæmonians.

They also dedicated Erafus the son of Triphylus. But

with respect to the artificers of these statues, Apollo and

Callisto were made by Pausanias the Apollonian; Victory,

and the image of Areas, by Dædalus the Sicyonian;

Triphylus and Azah, by Areas Samolas; and Elatus,

Aphidas, and Erafus, by the Argive Antiphanes. These

statues the Tegeatæ sent to Dtelphos, in consequence as

having made the Lacedæmonians captives, who made

hostile incursions on their borders. Opposite to these arc

the offerings which the Lacedæmonians dedicated when

they vanquished the Athenians, viz. the Dioscuri, Jupiter,

Apollo, Diana; and together with these, Neptune and

Lysander the son of Aristocretus, receiving a crown from

Neptune. There are besides, Abas, who prophesied to

Lysander, and-Hermon, who was the pilot of Lysander'9

prætorian sliip. Thcocofmus the Mtgarensian made this

statue of Hermon, when he was ranked among the citi­

zens of the Megarenses. But the Dioscuri were made by

the Argive Antiphanes. The prophet Abas was made by

Pauson from Calaurea belonging to the Troezenians.

Damias made Diana, Neptune, and Lysander; and Athe-

nodorus Apollo and Jupiter. Both these artists were Ar­

cadians from Clitov. Behind the statues which we have

just mentioned, the statues of those men are placed who

alsisted Lysander in the battle at Ægospotamos, and who

were either Spartans, or the allies of the Spartans. And

these ave as follow: Aracus and Erianches, the former a

Lacedæmonian, and the latter a Bœotian from Mimas.

After these Astycrares, Cephisocles, Hermophantus, Hici-

sius, Chians; '1 imarchus and Diagoras, Rhodians; Theo-
