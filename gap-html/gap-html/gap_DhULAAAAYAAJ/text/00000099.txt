OF GREECE.

the people were denominated Orchomenians. Yet the

appellation of Minyæ still remains, for the purpose of dis­

tinguishing these people from the Orchomenians in Ar­

cadia. Orchomenus therefore reigning, Hyettus came to

him from Argos; for this Hyettus was obliged to abandon

his country, on account of having murdered Molurus the

son of Arisbas, whom he had detected committing adul­

tery with his wife. Orchomenus gave this Hyettus, that

part of the country which is about the village Hyettus,

and the land adjoining to it. The author of the verses

which the Greeks call the Great Eoeæ, makes mention

«f Hyettus:

"Hyettus, when Arisbas' son he found,

Molurus, in the chamber of his wife,

Th' adult'rer slew, and ftoin his country fled,

Argns, the fertile nurse of gen'rous steeds.

To Minyas' son Orchomenus he came:

The exile then th' heroic prince receiv'd,

And nobly gave him of his realms a fliarc."

But it is evident, that this Hyettus was the first that

punished adultery. For in after times Draco, among the

laws which he made for the Athenians, relative to the

punishment of unjust actions, enacted, that adultery should

he severely punished. The name too of the Minyæ arrived

at such a degree of dignity, that Neleus, the son of Cre-

theus and king of Pylus, married from Orchomenusa

Aoris the daughter of Amphion the son of Hilasiust
