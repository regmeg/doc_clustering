from the MS. Commentary of Olympiodorus on the Gorgias

unfolds the meaning of Neptune's trident in a manner perfectly

satisfactory, and at the fame time shews the great beauty of the

symbols employed by the ancients in their arcane theology, if tU

And Pluto wears a helmet, on account of the darkness over

which he presides. For, as a helmet conceals the head, so Pluto

is the power that presides over invisible natures."

And here, a reader unskilled in the ancient theology will

doubtless object, that according to this doctrine, Neptune must

either be the fame with Juno, since he is the divinity of air, or

there must be two divinities of the air. To this I answer, that

Neptune, considered as one divinity who presides over all the

middle elements, comprehends in his essence Juno, according to

her sublunary distribution; so that both Neptune and Juno

govern the air, but the former more universally, and the latter

more particularly; the former ruling at the same time over other
