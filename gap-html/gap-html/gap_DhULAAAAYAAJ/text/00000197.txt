OF GREECE. x83

CHAP. XXIX.

Above those which I have now numerated, this picture

contains a representation of the companions of Ulysses,

Perimedes and Eurylochus, carrying victims; and these

are black rams. After these there is a man seated; and

the inscription shews that he is Ocnus. He is represented

twisting a rope : and a female ass stands by him, who eats

the rope as fast he twists it. They fay that this Ocnus

was an industrious man, who had an expensive wife; and

that whatever he collected by his industry, she soon after

found means to consume. They are of opinion, therefore,

that Polygnotus designed to represent this affair by the

rope-maker and his ass. I know, indeed, that the lonians,

when they fee a man very industrious, but at the fame

time labouring without any emolument, fay that he twists

the rope of Ocnus. Diviners, too, who prophesy from

the flight os birds, call a certain bird Ocnus: and this

bird is the largest and most beautiful of herons, and at the

fame time is very rare. Tityus too is painted in this picture;

and is represented as no longer punished, but perfectly

wearied out with uninterrupted punishment. There is

likewise a certain obscure and imperfect image. On turn­

ing your attention to the other parts of the picture, you

will fee Ariadne very near the man who twists the rope.

She sits on a rock, and looks at her sister Phædra: and

her body is suspended by a rope which she holds with

both her hands. Indeed the particulars respecting th«

death of Phædra are here signified in a more becoming

manner. But Bacchus took away Ariadne from Theseus,
