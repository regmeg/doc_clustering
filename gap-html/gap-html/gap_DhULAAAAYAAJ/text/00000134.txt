120 THE DESCRIPTION

the son of Lampus was proclaimed victor on the harp;

Areas Echembrotus in singing to the pipe; and the Argivc

Sacadas in playing on the pipe without singing.

The fame Sacadas too was twice victorious after this,

in the Pythian games. And at that time the fame con­

test* were instituted as in the Olympic games, except the

contest with four horses. It was likewise established by

law, that boys should contend in the long race, and in the

twofold course. After this, Pythian games were insti­

tuted, in which a crown alone was the object of conten­

tion, and in which singing to the pipe was rejected, as

not being pleasing to the car. For elegies and funernl

dirges are accommodated to the melody of pipes. The,

sacred offering of Echembrotus confirms what 1 have said:

for he dedicated in Thebes a brazen tripod to Hercules,

with this inscription: Echembrotus Arcas dedicates

this statue to Hercules, in consequence of having

BEEN VICTORIOUS rN THE CONTESTS OF THE AmPHIC-

TYONS, AND THIS BY SINGING AMONG THE GREEKS,

songs and elegies. This was the reason, therefore,

why the contest of singing to the pipe ceased. After­

wards they added horse-races, and Clisthenes the Sicyo-

nian tyrant was victorious in the chariot-race. In the

eighth Pythiad, the contests of those who play on the harp,

but do not accompany it with their voice, were instituted;

and in this contest Agelaus Tegeates was victorious. In

the twenty-third Pythiad, the armed course was esta­

blished; and in this Timænctus tiie Phliasian received the

laurel crown, in five Olympiads after which Demaratus

Hencensis was victorious. In the forty-eighth Pythirul,

the contest with the two-yoked car was adopted; and iu

this the car of Execestides the Phocenlian was victorious,
