chus; and the statues which they contain are made of

wood. Whom these were made by, I cannot by any means

conjecture.

The Bulidii denominate that god, whom they venerate

above all others, the greatest : and in my opinion, this is an

appellation of Jupiter. They have likewise a fountain

which they call Saunion. But to Cirrha, which is a haven

Cirrha is entirely destitute of trees, whether they are un­

willing to plant any in it through a certain dire execration,

or whether this arises from the inaptitude of the foil.
