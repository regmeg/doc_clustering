in the heroic age, men abounded of a prodigious stature cannot

be denied, without supposing the whole of the Iliad to be a

fable:- though, on the other hand, to imagine with the Scotch

Grammarian, that there has been a gradual declension of the

stature of mankind from the most early periods, and that the

human species will at last come to nothing, is an opinion too

extravagant and unphilosophical to deserve the labour of confu-

tation. The fact is, that the superior strength and size of the

celebrated heroes of antiquity can only be accounted for satis­

factorily, by having recourse to that recondite wisdom of the

ancients, which was first discoveicd in the colleges of the ./Egyp­

tian priests, and was afterwards delivered Enigmatically by Py­

thagoras, scientifically by Plato, and cnthcaJlicaUy, or according to

a diific energy (iiSiaj-'xwf), by his latter disciples. From this most

arcane and sublime wisdom -we learn, that all the parts of the

universe cannot participate the providence of the gods in a simi­

lar manner, but that some of its parts must enjoy this eternally,

and others temporally; some in a primary, and others in a secon­

dary degree. For the universe being a perfect whole, must have

a first, a middle, and a last part. But its first parts, as having

the most excellent subsistence, must always exist according to

nature; and its last parts must sometimes subsist according to,

and sometimes contrary to nature. Hence the celestial bodies,

which are the first parts of the universe, perpetually subsist ac­

cording to nature, both the whole spheres, and the multitude

co-ordinate to these -wholes*; and the only alteration which

they experience is a mutation of figure, and variation of light

at different periods: but in the sublunary region, while
