4o THE DESCRIPTION

produced by the flame, become divided into two parts. I

am induced to believe that this account is true, from what

I have seen elsewhere. For in Mysia above Caicus there is

a small city which is called Pioniae. They fay that this

city was built by Pionis, who was one of the posterity of

Hercules. While they are celebrating his funeral rites, a

smoke rises spontaneously from the sepulchre: and of this

I have been a spectator The Thebans too exhibit the

sepulchre of Tiresias, which is at the distance of about

twenty stadia from the sepulchre of the sons of Oedipus.

But they acknowledge that Tiresias died in Haliartia : they

likewise own that the sepulchre which they shew of him

is merely honorary. The Thebans too have a tomb of

Hector the son of Priam, near the fountain which is called

Oeoi podia. For they fay that his bones were brought

hither from Troy, in consequence of the following oracle:

"Thebans, who inhabit the city of Cadmus, if you wish to

reside in your country, blest with the posseflion of blame­

less wealth, bring the bones of Hector the son of Priam

into your dominions from Asia, and reverence the hero

agreeably to the mandate of Jupiter." But the fountain

Oedipodia was thus denominated, because Oedipus washed

off in it the blood occasioned by the murder of his father.

Near this fountain is the sepulchre of Asphodicus, who,

according to the Thebans, flew Parthenopæus the son of

Talaus in an engagement with the Argives. For the

verses in the Thebaid, respecting the death of Partheno­

pæus, assert that he was slain by Periclymenus.
