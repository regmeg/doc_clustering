j6 THE DESCRIPTION

no care to acquire wealth, and thiff in consequence of an

oracle, which declared, that the desire of riches would

be the only thing destructive to Sparta, Lyfander inflamed

them with a vehement desire of becoming rich. Hence,

following the opinion of the Persians, and judging accord­

ing to their law, I conclude that Lyfander was more hurt-

ful than useful to the Lacedæmonians.

CHAP. XXXIII.

But in Haliartus there is a sepulchre of Lyfander, and

an heroic monument of Cecrops the son of Pandion. The

mountain too, Tilphussius, and the fountain Tilphussa,

are about fifty stadia distant from Haliartus. It is said by

the Greeks, that when the Argives together with the sons

of Polynices took Thebes, as they were leading along the

prophet Tiresias, with their other spoils, to the Delphic

Apollo, the prophet being thirsty by the way drank of the

fountain Tilphufla, and immediately after expired. His

sepulchre therefore is near this fountain. They fay, too,

that Manto the daughter of Tiresias was given to Apollo

by the Argives; but that by order of the god she parsed

over in a stiip to Colophon in Ionia, and there married

Rhacius the Cretan. With respect to other particulars

about Tiresias, such as the number of years which he

lived, his being changed from a man into a woman, and

what Homer asserts of him in the Odyssey, that he was the

only wife person in Hades—these are known to every one.

Among the Haliartians too there is in the open air a

temple of those goddesses who are called Praxidicai, or, the

Winger^
