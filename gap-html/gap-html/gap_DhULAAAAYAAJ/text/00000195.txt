OF GREECE. 181

the poem called Minyas, in which there are the following

verses upon Theseus and Pirithous:

"Old Charon in his vessel fill'd with shades

Refus'd these living heroes to admit.

r Hence Polygnotus has reprtsented Charon as an old man.

The persons in this vefiei cannot be very clearly discerned.

However, Tellis, who is very young, is among these, arW

Thasus. On the banks of Acheron, an affair is repre*

below Charon, a son who had behaved unjustly to his

father, is strangled by his father. For the ancients very

much reverenced their parents, as may be inferred from

other examples, and from the actions of those in Catana,

who are called the pious. For when this city was set on

servation of their silver and gold, but one of them took up

his father in his arms, and the other his mother, an/1 fled

with-them out of the city. Through the rapid fury how­

ever of the fire, they found great difficulty in making

their escape; yet notwithstanding this, they did not leave

their parents, but palled through the stream of fire, which,

as they fay, separated itself into two parts, and neither in­

present honoured by the Catanæans. ..

In this picture of Polygnotus, near the man who injured

his father, and is on this account punished in Hades, there
