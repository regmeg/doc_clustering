name. The Platæcnses therefore celebrate this Dædal

festival, every seventh year, as an historian of this coun­

try told me: in reality, however, the interval of time

between its celebration is not so long. But though I wus

■desirous of accurately numbering the interval of rime from

•one Dædal festival to another, I was not able to accom­

plish my design. They celebrate this festival in the fol­

lowing manneri—There is a grove, which is the greatest

in Bceotia, not far from Alalcomenæ; and in this place

there are many ancient oaks. The Platæenfes coming

into this grove, place in it portions of boiled flesh. And

they have but little trouble indeed to defend it from other

birds, but they are obliged to guard it diligently from the

crows j and if any one of these birds carries oft" any por­

tion of the flesh, they observe on what tree it perches,

cut down this tree, and make from -it a Dædalian statue z

/or they call the statue thus made Dædalian.

This festival the Platæenfes celebrate -privately, and

call it the lesser Dædali: for the Bœotians celebrate the

greater Dædala in a very public manner, every sixtieth

year. They fay that the festival was omitted for so

long a tim? when the Platæenfes were driven from their

native country. And in the lesser Dædala, indeed, they

prepare fourteen statues every year; and these the Platæ­

enfes, Coronæi, Thespienses, Tanagræi, Chæronenses,

Orchomenii, Lebadenses, and Thebans, take away by lot.

For these people thought proper to be reconciled with the

Platæenfes, to partake of their common assembly, and to

fend a victim to tlie Dædal festival, when Thebes was re­

stored by Cassander the son of Antipater. But those cities

which are of less estimation bestow their gifts upon this

festival according to lot. They carry the image to Aso-
