Page 64. When Bacchus Jirjl came into Atlica.~\ The reader

must, be careful to remember, that the Bacchus here mentioned

was one of those heroes of whom we have given an account in

the note to ;>. 46; andthat he was called Bacchus because he

descended from the deity of that name.

Page 67. Hercules, according to the fable, strangling the Dra­

gons.'} I havr- already observed concerning Hercules, that he

was one of those exalted characters belonging to the human race,

who, from their hi^h degree of proximity and alliance to ejsenlial

Heroes, were justly called by ihe ancients Heroes xulct yi-rn, or

according to habitude, and that he energized principally ac­

cording to an intellectual life. As Hercules, therefore, was a

character of this kind, it would be absurd to consider the pro­

digies related of him as historical facts; but we should view them

in the light of fables, under which certain divine truths are con­

cealed. Indeed, to such as consider the accounts given of Her­

cules as historical fists, we may very properly address the words

of Plato to Dionylius, when he was interrogating him on this

very subject, I mean the achievements of Hercules, "that if the

things reported of Hercules are true, he was neither the son of

Jupiter, nor blessed, but on the contrary miserable: but if he

was the son of Jupiter and blessed, these accounts are false."

But the meaning of the present fable, as Pausanias very pro­

perly calls it, appears to be as follow.: A dragon is a symbol of

the partial life of the foul, i. e. of the life which she leads while

separated from the gods: for as a dragon is said to cast off its

skin and become young again, so the soul acquires rejuvenescency
