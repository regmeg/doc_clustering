among the Phocenses (who enriched themselves the most

of all others, and for the longest time, with the treasures

of the god), and by the army of the Gauls. And last of

all, this temple could not escape the impiety of Nero, who

took away from hence five hundred brazen images, which

were partly statues of the gods, and partly of men. They

relate, that a most ancient contest was established here,

which consisted in singing a hymn in honour of Apollo:

and that he who first conquered in singing was the Cretan

Chrysothemis, whose father Carmanor is said to have pu­

rified Apollo. Philammon was the next that was victo­

rious after Chrysothemis ; and Thamyris the son of Phi­

lammon conquered after his father. They fay that Or­

pheus was unwilling to engage in this contest, by reason

of the dignity of his composition relative to the mysteries,

and that elevation of foul which he acquired by his other

productions; and that Musæus would not engage in it,

through his imitation of Orpheus in every respect. They

fay, too, that Eleuther bore away the Pythian palm,

through speaking with a loud.and sweet voice, as he was

not able to sing the song which he had composed. They

likewise farther relate, that Hesiod was not permitted

to contend, because he had not learned to accompany his

harp with his voice: but that Homer came to Delphos for

the purpose of consulting what was necessary to be done;

though even if he had learnt to play on the harp, his art

would have been of no use to him, through the loss of

his sight. In the third year of the forty-eighth Olympiad,

in which Glaucias the Crotonian was victor, the Amphic-

tyons instituted games, in which there was singing to the

harp as at first; and to which they added singing to the

pipe, and playing on the pipe without singing. Cephalen
