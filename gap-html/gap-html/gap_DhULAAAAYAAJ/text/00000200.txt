i86 THE DESCRIPTION

CHAP. XXX.

AfTER these Polygnotus has painted the daughters of

Pandarus. Homer, in the speeches of Penelope, fays, that

through the anger of the gods, their parents died while

they were virgins, and that thus becoming orphans they

were educated by Venus. That they likewise received other

benefits from other goddesses; as for instance, sufficient

prudence and beauty of form from Juno, tallness from

Diana, and such works as arc adapted to the female sex

from Minerva. Lastly, that Venus ascended to heaven,

and obtained from Jupiter prosperous nuptials for the vir­

gins; but that during the absence of Van us they were

seized hy the harpies, and delivered up to the Furies.

And such is the account given of them by Homer. But

Polygnotus has crowned them with flowers, and has re­

presented them playing with dice. The names of these

women were Camiro and Clytie. It appears, too, that

their father Pandarus was a Milesian, from Miletus a

Cretan city, and the associate of Tantalus, both in his

theft, and fraudulent oath. After the daughters of Pan­

darus, Autilochus is seen, with one os his feet on a stone,

and holding his head with both his hands. Agamemnon

succeeds Antilochus; and he is represented leaning with

his left arm on a sceptre, and holding a wand in his

hands. Protesilaus fits looking at Achilles ; and Patroclus

stands above Achilles. All these are beardless except

Agamemnon. Phocus is painted above these, who appears

to- be quite a youth; together with lascus, who has a beard,

and.
