things in the mysteries which men were unacquainted with

before. It is likewise reported of Orpheus, that after the

death of his wife, he came in consequence of it to Aornus

in Thesprotia, because there was an ancient oracle there of

departed spirits; that when he came here he expected the

foul of Eurydice would follow him; but that finding him­

self disappointed, he flew himself through grief. The

Thracians add, that the nightingales, which build their

nests about the sepulchre of Orpheus, sing sweeter and

louder than other nightingales. But the Macedonians,

who inhabit die country under the Pierian mountain, and

the city Dibs, fay that Orpheus was slain in that place by

women. On proceeding from Dios to the mountain at

about the distance of twenty stadia, you will fee a pillar

on the right hand, and upon it a stone urn, which, ac­

cording to the inhabitants of this place, contains the bones

of Orpheus. The river Helicon flows through this part

of the country, and at the distance of eighty-five stadia

hides itself in the earth. Afterwards having concealed it­

self for about twenty-two stadia, it again rises, and, as­

suming the name of Baphyræ instead os Helicon, becomes

a navigable river, and pours itself into the sea. The Diatx

say, that this river at first ran in an open channel; but that

when the women who flew Orpheus attempted to wash

themselves from his blood in it, then it funk into the earth,

that its water might not be the means of purifying them

from his murder.

I have likewise heard a different report from this in

Larifia: that formerly there was a city in Olympus called

. Libethra, and which stood in that part of the mountain

whkh is turned towards Macedonia: that the sepulchre

of Orpheus is not far from hence; and that an oracle of
