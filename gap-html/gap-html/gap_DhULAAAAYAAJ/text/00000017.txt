OF GREECE. 3

the Thebans were accustomed to protract their public

assemblies for a long time, they watched the time of their

assembling together, and, whenever this happened, cul­

tivated their land in peace. But Neocles the Theban, who

was then the chief magistrate of the Bœotians, perceiving

the crafty conduct of the Platæenses, ordered each of the

Thebans to come into the assembly armed, and immedi­

ately led them, not in a direct line from Thebes through

the fields, but to Hyfia, which is between the Eleuthe-

rans and Attica, and where the Platæenses had no spies.

This took place about the middle of the day: and the

Platæenses, supposing that the Thebans were engaged in

their assembly, came into their fields as usual, having the

gates of the city securely closed behind them. Th«

Thebans therefore made the Platæenses that were within

the walls promise, that they would leave the city before

sun-set; each man bringing with him one> and each

woman two garments. At that time, indeed, the Platæ­

enses were oppressed in a manner very different from that

which took place formerly through the Lacedæmonians,

under the command of Archidamus: for then when they

jvere besieged they were prevented from leaving the city

by a twofold wall; but here the Thebans would not suffer

them to enter into their walls. This second loss happened

to the Platæenses, in the third year prior to the battle at

Leuctra, and when Asteus was the Athenian archon;

Every part of the city at this time was destroyed by the

Thebans, except the temples of the gods. But the man­

Platæenses. For they were, in the first place, received

at Chaeronea, placed a guard over the Thebans, endea-
