fee THE DESCRIPTION

On descending from the mountain Laphystion to the

temple of Minerva Itonia, you will see the river Phalarus

running into the lake Cephiffis. Beyond the mountain La-

phystion is Orchomenus, an illustrious and renowned Gre*

cian city, which once arrived at the highest degree of feli­

city, and which was destroyed by nearly the fame means at

Mycene and Delos. The following particulars are handed

down to us respecting its ancient affairs. They fay, that

Andreus the son of the river Peneus, first of all dwelt in

this place, and that from him the country was denominated

Andreis. That Athamas, becoming acquainted with him,

gave him all the country about the mountain Laphystion,

together with that region which is now called Coronea

and Haliartia. But Athamas, being of opinion that he

Ihould not leave any male children behind him (because

he called to mind his conduct, when insane, towards Lear-

chus and Melicerte, Leiicon had died through disease,

and he was ignorant whether Phrixus was alive, or had any

children), on this account he adopted Coronus and Ha-

liartus, the sons of Thersander, who was the son of Sisy­

phus: for Athamas-was the brother of Sisyphus. How­

ever, when Phrixus, as some say, or Presbon, according

to others, who was the son of Phrixus by the daughter

of Ættes, returned from the Colchi, the sons of Ther­

sander gave up the kingdom of Athamas to Athamas and

his progeny. These, therefore;, having received from

Athamas a pnrt of the land, built Haliartus and Coronea.

But prior to the return of these, Evippe the daughter of

Lcucon was given in marriage by Athamas to Andreus:

and by her he had Eteoclcs; though it is reported by the

citizens, that Eteoclcs was the son of the river Cephisus.
