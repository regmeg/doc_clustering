OF GREECE. 5

Semele. For my own part, I can easily beliere that Ac-

tæon might be torn in pieces by his dogs, without the in­

terference of the goddess, in consequence of their rushing

furiously upon him, without perceiving who he was.

In what part of Cithæron the destruction of Pentheus

the son of Echion happened, or where Oedipus when he

was born was exposed, is not known by any one; though

I am not ignorant of the bisected road belonging to the

Phocenses, in which Oedipus flew his father. But the

mountain Cithæron is sacred to Jupiter Cithæronius, of

which I shall speak more copiously when my discourse

leads me to mention it again. Near the entrance to

Platæa, you may perceive the sepulchres of those that

fought against the Medes. The other Greeks indeed have

one common sepulchre: but the Lacedæmonians and

Athenians that fell in that battle have separate tombs;

and upon them there are elegies composed by Simonides.

Not far from the common sepulchre of the Greeks, there

is an altar of Jupiter Eleutherius. The sepulchre is made

of brass; but the altar and statue of Jupiter are of white

stone. Even at present, every fifth year, they celebrate

the festivals called Eleutheria, in which the greatest re­

wards are proposed for the race. They run before the

altar armed. The trophy which the Greeks erected for

their victory over the Platæenscs, is about fifteen stadia

distant from the city. When you enter the city, in that

part which contains the altar and statue of Eleutherian

Jupiter, you will see the heroic monument of Platæa.

What the Platæenscs report concerning her, I have al­

ready related- The Platæenscs too have a temple of Juno

which deserves to be inspected, both for its magnitude,

pud the ornament of the statues which it contains. Qe
