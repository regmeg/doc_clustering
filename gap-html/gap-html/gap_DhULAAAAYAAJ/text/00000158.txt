?44 THE DESCRIPTION

the basis for the most part resembles that of a tower, and

rises from an acute bottom to a broad top. Each of its

(ides is covered throughout, but is begirt with transverse

rones of iron, like the steps in a ladder. Straight and

ductile lamina of iron are bent in their extremities out­

wards : and this was the feat of the bowl. But that which

is called by the Delphi the navel, and which is made of

white stone, is, as they fay, the middle point of the whole

earth. And Pindar in one of his odes speaks in con­

formity to this opinion. Here too there is an offering of

the Lacedæmonians, viz. Hermione the daughter of Me-

nelaus, who was married to Orestes the son of Aga­

memnon, and prior to this to Neoptolemus the son of

Achilles. This was made by Calamis. The Ætolians like­

wise dedicated in this temple a statue of Eurydamus, who

was their commander when they fought against the Gauls.

In the mountains of Crete the city Elyros yet exists. Thi»

city sent a brazen goat to Apollo, which is represented

suckling Phylacis and Phylander. The Elyrians fay, that

these were the sons of Apollo and the nymph Acacallis;

and that Apollo had connection with her in the city

Tarrha, and in the house os Carmanor. But the Carystii

from Eubcea sent a brazen ox to Apollo for having

gained a victory over the Persians.

Both theCarystii and Platxcnfes,indeed,dedicated oxen,

as it appears to me, because, having expelled the Barba­

rians from Greece, they obtained in other respects a stable

degree of property, and were enabled to cultivate a free

land. The Ætolians dedicated the images of their com­

manders, and together with these Apollo and Diana, in

consequence of having conquered their neighbours the

Acarnanes. "What the Liparxans relate of themselves with
