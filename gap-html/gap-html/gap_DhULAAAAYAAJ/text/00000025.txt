OF GREECE. u

Wyrians, and Enchelece, a people of Illyria, his son

Polydore reigned. Pentheus the son of Echion was

powerful both through the dignity of his origin, and the

friendship of the king; but as he was an insolent and im­

pious man, he was punished by Bacchus for his impious

behaviour towards him. Labdacus was the son of Poly­

dore j and Polydore on his death-bed delivered up Lab­

dacus and his kingdom to Nycteus. Other particulars

belonging to this affair I have related in my description

pf Sicyoniaj I mean, after what manner Nycteus died,

and how the guardianship of his son was committed to

Lycus the brother of Nycteus,- and all the power of the

Thebans.

Lycus indeed delivered up the reins of government to

Labdacus when he was of age; but Labdacus dying not

Jong after this, Lycus took Laius the son of Labdacus;

into his protection. And while he was again acting the

part of a guardian, Amphion and Zethus collecting toge­

ther an army, invaded the country; and those who were

careful lest the race of Cadmus should become extinct, se­

cretly conveyed Laius away. The sons of Antiope, however,

vanquished Lycus in battle, and taking possession of the

kingdom, joined the lower city with Cadmea, and called

the whole Thebes, on account of their alliance with the

nymph Thebe, the daughter of Prometheus. Homer, in

the following verses in the Odyssey, confirms the truth

of this account:

Tlio' bold in open field, they yet surround

The town with walls, and mound inject on mound;

Here ramparts stood, there tow'rs rose high in air,

And there thro' seven wide portals rufli'd the war.

However, he makes no mention of Amphion raising the

walls
