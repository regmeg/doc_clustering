FIRST VOLUME. 245

scssed the art of constructinglamps that would burn for many ages

without supply, I think the liberal reader wiD be fully convinced,

from perusing the following account of lamps found in ancient

sepulchres, collected from Licetus, De Lucernis Antiquorum,

Baptista Porta, and Pancirollus.

In the first, place, then, Baptista Porta in his treatise of Natu­

ral Magic, relates, that about the year 1550, in the island Nefu

in Naples, a marble sepulchre of a certain Roman was discover­

year 1401, by a countryman, who digging deeper than usual, ob­

which had a large wound in the breast. Above the head of the

deceased there was found a lamp burning with perpetual fire,

which neither wind nor water, nor any other superinduced liquor

Pallas, Evander's son, whom Turnus' spear

In battle slew, of mighty bulk, lies here.

In the Appian Road too, at Rome, in the time of Pope Paul

the Third, a lamp was discovered burning in the sepulchre of Tul-

lia the daughter of Cicero, which became extinct on the admis-
