i8a THE DESCRIPTION

is a man. suffering punishment for sacrilege. A woman

well acquainted with poisons, and other instruments of

punishment, is represented tormenting him. Men there-i

fore at that tine were' remarkably pious towards the

gods: and this the Athenians evinced when they rook the

temple of Olympian Jupiter among the Syracusans; for

they .did not move any of die sacred offerings, and suffered

the Syraciisan priest who guarded the offerings still to

continue his office. This too the Mede Datis evinced:

for having found a statue of Apollo in a Phœnician ship,

, he immediately gave it to the Tanagræans to be carried

back to Delium. So that at that time all men venerated

a divine nature; and Polygnotus well knowing this,

painted the man suffering in Hades for sacrilege. Above

those which we have now enumerated is Euryhomus,

who, according to the Delphic interpretersr of sacred con-?

cerns, is one of the dæmons belonging to Hades, and who

eats the flesh of dead bodies, so as to leave the bones

quite bare. However, neither Homer in the Odyssey, nor

the poetical composition which is called Minyas, nor the

verses which are denominated No/hi, or the Return (for in

these there is an account of Hades and its terrors), make

any mention of the dæmon Eurynomus I shall therefore

describe the figure of Eurynomus as he appears in this

picture. His colour is between azure and black, and is

like that of flies which irifest meat. He shews his teethj

and firs on the skin of a vulture. Auge and Iphimedea from

Arcadia present themselves to the view after Eurynomus.

Auge came to MyGa, which is near Tcuthras, and is said

to have brought forth a son the most like his father, of

all the women with which Hercules wr.s connected. Bui

the Carians in Mylessæ pay great honours to Iphimedea.
