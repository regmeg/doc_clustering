respect to the Tyrrheni is most absurd. For they say,

that the Pythian deity having ordered them to engage the

Tyrrheni with a very small fleet of ships, they on the

contrary drew out against them five three-oared galleys.

That the Tyrrheni considering themselves as not inferior

them with an equal number of ships. But when the

Liparæans took the five galleys of the Tyrrheni, the Tyr­

rheni attacked them a second, third, and fourth time with

the like number of vessels. All these however were taken

by the Liparæans, who in consequence of this victory

sent as many statues of Apollo to Delphos, as the number

of the ships which they had captured amounted to. Eche-

cratides, too, a Larissæan, dedicated a small Apollo: and

the Delphi say, that this was dedicated the first of all the

offerings.

breadth, four hundred and twenty stadia. The Libyans

are said to have been the first that sailed to this island,
