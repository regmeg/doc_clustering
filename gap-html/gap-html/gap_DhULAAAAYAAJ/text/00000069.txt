OF GREECE. 55

tiope), you will see the ruins of the house of Pindar, and

a temple os the mother Dindymene, which was dedicated

by Pindar. The statue of the goddess was made by the

Thebans Aristomedes and Socrates. On one day in every

year they think proper to open this temple. I happened

to be present on that day, and by this means had an oppor­

tunity of seeing the statue, which is of Pentelican stone, as

well as the throne on which the goddess sits. In the road

from the gate Neitis there is a temple of Themis, and

in it a statue of white stone. After this there are two

temples, one of the Parcæ, and the other of Judicial Ju­

piter. The statue of Jupiter is of stone; but there are

no statues of the Parcæ. At a small distance from hence,

there is a statue of Hercules in the open air, under the

appellation of Rinocoloujles, because, in order to disgrace

those ambassadors (as the Thebans fay) that were sent by

the Orchomenians to demand tribute, he cut off their

noses.

On proceeding to the distance of twenty-five stadia

from hence, you will fee a grove of Cabirian Ceres and

Proserpine, into which the uninitiated are not permitted to

enter. But who the Cabiri are, and what the ceremonies

which are performed in honour of them, and the mother

of the gods, I must beg those that are desirous of hearing

such particulars to suffer me to pass over in silence. No­

thing however hinders me from disclosing the origin of

these mysteries according to the Thebans. They fay,

then, that there was once a city in this place, and inha­

bitants, who were called Cabiri; and that Ceres depo­

sited something with Prometheus, who was one of the

Cabiri, and with his son Æt.næus, after she became ac­

quainted with them. What this deposit was, and the
