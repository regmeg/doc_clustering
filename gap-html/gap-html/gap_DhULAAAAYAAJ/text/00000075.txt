OF GREECE. 61

I have heard another account of this affair, that Hercules

was connected with all the fifty daughters of Thestius in

one night, that they all bore him sons, and the youngest

and oldest of these daughters were each of them de­

livered of twins. However, for my own part, I can

never be induced to believe, that Hercules could be

excited to such a violent anger against the daughter of

his friend. Besides, it is not probable, that he who, while

he was among men, punilhed the insolent behaviour os

others, and particularly revenged impiety towards the

gods, would build a temple, and appoint a priestess for

himself as if he was a god. But to me, indeed, it appears,

that this temple is more ancient than the period in which

Hercules the son of Amphitryon lived: and I do not

know, whether the dedication of this temple ought not

to be ascribed to the Hercules who is one of the Idxi

Dactyli, as I have discovered that the Erythræans in Ionia,

and the Tyrians have raised temples to him. Nor are the

Bœotians ignorant of this name of Hercules; for they

fay, that the temple of Mycaleflian Ceres was committed

to the care of the Idxan Hercules.
