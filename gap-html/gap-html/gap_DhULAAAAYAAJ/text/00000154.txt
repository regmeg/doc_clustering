140 THE DESCRIPTION

beg pardon for the deed. When therefore he drove to the*

island Leucophrys, and had fastened his vessel either to a

stone or a trunk of a tree, Tennes, impelled by anger, flew

him with a battle-ax. And hence it came to be a proverbial

saying, when any one resolutely denied complying with

the request os another, that he cut him down with a Te-

nedian battle-ax. The Greeks fay that Tennes was flaist

by Achilles, as he was making depredations on this island.

But the Tenedii in process of time joined themselves to

the Trojan Alexandreans, through the imbecility of their

affairs.

The Greeks too, who warred against the Persians, de­

dicated in Olympia a brazen Jupiter, and in Delphos an

Apollo, for the naval victory which they obtained at Ar-

temisium and Salamis. It is also said, that Themistocles,

when he came to Delphos, dedicated to Apollo the spoilt

of the Medes; and that, on his inquiring whether he

might place these gifts within the temple, the Pythian

priestess ordered him to carry them entirely away from

the temple. But the oracle which flie gave him respect­

beautiful spoils of the Persians, but swiftly carry them to

your own habitation." It is certainly a wonderful cir­

cumstance, that the god should alone reject the spoils of

the Medes which were presented by Themistocles. Seme,

however, are of opinion, that all the Persian spoils would

have been rejected, if, like Themistocles, they had first in­

terrogated Apollo whether he would accept them. Others

again fay, that^ as Apollo foreknew Themistocles would

become a suppliant to the Persians, he was unwilling to

receive their spoils, lest the Persians through hatred of the

donor sliould reject his supplications. You may find this
