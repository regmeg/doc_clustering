i7o NOTES ON THE

"In Dalmatia too, in that which is called the cavern of Diana,

many bodies may be seen, whose tiba exceed sixteen cubits.

"But the grammarian Apollonius relates that there was an

earthquake during the reign of Tiberius Nero, through which

many celebrated cities of Asia were entirely destroyed, but which

Tiberius afterwards rebuilt at his own expence; for which bene­

fit the Asiatics made a colossal statue of him, and placed it near

the temple of Venus, which is in the forum of the Romans: and

after this, they placed the statues of the several cities that had

been rebuilt. Not a few too of the cities of Sicily suffered

through this earthquake, and places near Rhegilfm, together

with several of the cities in Pontus. But in those parts in which

the earth was rent asunder, very large dead bodies were found;

the magnitude of which indeed so astonished the inhabitants,

that they were unwilling to move them. That the affair how­

ever might be generally known, they sent to Rome one of the

teeth of these bodies; and this was more than a foot long. The

ambassadors, at the fame time they shewed this to Tiberius, asked

him whether he wished that the hero to whom this tooth belong­

dently thought of a means by which he might neither be deprived

of knowing the dimensions of this body, nor yet be guilty of

the impiety of robbing the dead. He ordered a celebrated ge­

ometrician, whose name was Pulcrus, and whom he honoured for

his art, to be called, and desired him to make a face in propor­

tion to the fize of that tooth. The geometrician therefore,

having calculated from the fize of the tooth the dimensions of

the face and of the whole body, accomplished the taste imposed

on him with great celerity, and brought the face to the Emperor,

who, after he had satisfied himself with beholding it, ordered the

tooth to be restored to the place from whence it was taken.

"Nor ought we to refuse our assent to this narration, since there

Is a place in Egypt called Litiæ, in which bodies are to be seen,

not less in size than the above-mentioned, and these not buried in
