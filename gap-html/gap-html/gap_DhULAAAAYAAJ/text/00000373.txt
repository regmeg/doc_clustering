THIRD VOLUME.

Phrontis are in Odyssey 3. ver. 277, and are thus translated by

Mr. Pope:

Mean time from flaming Troy we cut the way,

With Menelaus thro* the curling sea:

But when to Sunium's sacred point we came,

Crowa'd with the temple of th' Athenian dame;

Atrides' pilot, Phrontis, there expir'd

(Phrontis, of all the sons of men admir'd,

To steer the bounding bark with steady toil,

When the storm thickens, and the billows boil):

While yet he exercis'd the steersman's art,

Apollo toueh'd him with his gentle dart;

Ev'n with the rudder in his hand he fell.

^aSe '77» Homer.'] In the 17th book of the Iliad, ver. 30$,

Homer fays of Ajax that he broke the cavity of the coat of mail

by Pausanias respecting the daughters of Pan da rue are in Odyssey

20. ver. 66; and are thus translated by Mr. Pope!

So, Pandarus, thy hopes, three orphans fair,

Were doom'd to wander thro* the devious air |

Thyself, untimely, and thy consort, dy'd.

But four celestials both your cares supply1 d.

Venus in tender delicacy rears

With honey, milk, and wine, their infant years:

Imperial Juno to their youth aflign'd

A form majestic, and sagacious mind;
