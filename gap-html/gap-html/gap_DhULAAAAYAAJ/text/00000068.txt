54 THE DESCRIPTION

on the right hand of this river are the extremities

of the Bœotian land: and in this 'place there is a small

city Alæ, near the sea, which divides the continent of the

Locrians from Eubcea.

nMONC the Thebans, near the gate Neitis, is the

sepulchre of Menoeceus the son of Creon, who voluntarily

slew himself, in compliance with the Delphic oracle, when

Polynices came with an army from Argos. A pomegra­

nate-tree grows near his tomb, the fruit of which, when

ripe, on breaking the exterior rind, has the appearance of

blood. This tree regerminates perpetually. The Thebans

too assert that the vine first made its appearance in their

country; but they have not any token to shew of this at

present. Not far from the sepulchre of Menoeceus, they

lay that the sons of Oedipus, fighting in a single combat,

slew each other. As a proof of this combat, there is a

pillar here, and upon it a stone shield. They {hew a

place, too, in which they fay Juno suckled Hercules, in

consequence of a deception employed by Jupiter. The

whole of this place is called Surma Antigones, or the draw­

ing of Antigone; because Antigone, when she sound her-r

self unable to raise the dead body of Polynices, endea-r

voured to draw it along, and continued her efforts till

she accomplished her design, and threw it on the funeral

pile os Eteocles, which was then enkindled. After you have

passed over the river which is called Dirce, from the wife of

Lycus (by whom according to report Antiope was in­

jured, and was on that account slain by the sons of An,
