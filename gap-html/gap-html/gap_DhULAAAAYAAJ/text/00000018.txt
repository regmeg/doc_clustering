4 THE DESCRIPTION

Toured by every possible means to accomplish their de­

struction, and at last restored the Platæcnses to their an­

cient habitations.

UN turning a little to the right hand from the straight

road of the Platxan land under Cithæron, you will fee the

ruins of Hysia and Erythræ. These were once cities of

the Bœotians; and even now among the ruins of Hysia

there is a temple of Apollo, the half of which is entire,

and a sacred well. According to the Bœotians, formerly

those that drank out of this well were endowed with the

gift of prophecy. Proceeding from hence into the public

road, you will again fee, on the right hand, that which

is called the sepulchre of Mardonius. Indeed that the

dead body of Mardonius could no where be found after

the battle in which he fell, is generally acknowledged;

nor can they tell by whom he was buried. It appears,

however, that Artontes, the son of Mardonius, gave great

gifts to Dionysophanes the Ephefian, and to others be­

longing to the Ionians, that they might not be negligent

with respect to the interment of Mardonius. And this

road leads from Eleutheræ to Platæa. But as you pro­

ceed from Megaree, you will fee on the right hand a

fountain, and a little beyond this a stone, which they call

the stene of Actæon: for they fay that Actaion used to

sleep on this, when he was weary with hunting; and that

in this place he (aw Diana washing herself in the neigh­

bouring fountain. But Stesichorus Himeræus writes, that

Diana threw upon Actæon a stag's hide, and thus caused

him to be slain by his dogs, that he might not marry
