FIRST VOLUME.

Page 119. The Orach of Night."] The following mystic par­

ticulars respecting the Oracle of Night arc given us by Proclus,

in Tim. p. 63, and p. 96. "The artificer of the universe, prior

to his whole fabrication, is said to have betaken himself to the

Oracle of Night, to have been there filled with divine concep­
