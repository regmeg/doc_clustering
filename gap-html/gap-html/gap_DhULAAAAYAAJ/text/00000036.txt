THE DESCRIPTION

CHAP. X.

Not far from the gates there is a common sepulchre

of those who fell in the engagement against Alexander

and the Macedonians. Near it they shew a place, in which

they say (if it may be believed) the teeth of the dragon

which was slain by Cadmus by the fountain were sown,

and became men. There is a hill on the right hand of

the gates, which is sacred to Apollo; and both the hill

and the god are called Ismenios, from the river Ismenus

slowing near this place. The first stone statues which

present themselves to the view on entering the city, are

those of Minerva and Mercury, whom they call Pronaoiy

or belonging to vestibules. That of Mercury was made by

Phidias, and that of Minerva by Scopas. After this there

is a temple, which contains a statue equal in magnitude

to that of the Branchidre, and in no respect different in its

form. Whoever fees one of these statues, and knows whom

it was made by, will, on beholding the other, perceive,

without any great skill, that its artificer was Canachus.

This statue, however, belonging to the Branchidre is made

of brass, but this of Apollo Ismenios of cedar. In the fame

place too there is a stone, upon which, they fay, Manto the

daughter of Tiresias fat. This stone is placed before the

vestibule of the temple, and is called at present the Jeai of

Manto.

On the right hand of the temple there are stone statues,

which they fay are images of Heniochc and Pyrrha the

daughters of Creon, who reigned while he was the

guardian
