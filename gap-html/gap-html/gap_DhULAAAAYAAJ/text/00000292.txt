i. e.

But when your pow'r around the whole has spread

A strong coercive bond, a golden chain

Suspend from sether."

Thus far Proclus. But the first: subsistence of the goddesr

Night is at the summit of that divine order, which is called by

the Chaldæan theologists mfa kJ WEpoj, intelligible and at the same

tune intelleSual. She is besides the mother of the gods, who are

nourished with intelligible food from the contemplation of her

divinity: and on this account (he is called the nurse of the

gods. Proclus therefore, in the above passages, speaks of Night

according to this her first subsistence: but in the passage before

us of Pausanias, we must consider this goddess according to her

mundane subsistence. I only add, that the Chaldæan doctrine

of other purer worlds above the inerratic sphere seems, from the

Orphic verses just; cited, to have been known to and embraced by

Orpheus. For the Chaldæan theologists, as I have proved in my

Notes on the Cratylus of Plato, believed, that there were seven

corporeal worlds: one empyrean, three ethereal, and three ma­

terial; which last three consist of the inerratic sphere, the planet­

ary spheres, and the sublunary region. And in one of the above

cited Orphic verses, Jupiter is ordered to receive all things in­

closed in æther; plainly indicating that there is something ethe­

real beyond the sensible heavens.

for, as among the genera superior to mankind some are the an-

tecessors of the gods; in like manner certain subordinate order*

of gods may be called the fore-runners of superior orders, con­

sidered as preparing, Jby their light, natures inferior to the divine

for the reception of illumination from a prior order of gods. Al-

cathous, therefore, very properly sacrificed to these gods before

he began to raise the wall of the tower.
