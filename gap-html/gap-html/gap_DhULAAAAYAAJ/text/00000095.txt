OF GREECE. 81

Hence, certain poets call Eteocles in their verses, Cephi-

fiades. This Eteocles, when he began to reign, suffered

them to call the country from Andreus. But lie instituted

two tribes, one of which he ordered to be called Cephi-

fiades, and the other after his own name Eteoclea. When

Halmus, too, the son of Sisyphus, came to him, he gave

him but a small part of the country for his portion: and

the towns were called Halmones from Halmus. But in

after times, one town alone came to be called Halmones.

1 H E Bœotians-, too, fay that Eteocles was the first that

sacrificed to the Graces. And, indeed, that he established

three Graces they are well convinced j but they have lost

the remembrance of the names which he gave them. For

the Lacedsemonians only worship two Graces, tlie statues

of which, they fay, were dedicated by Lacedæmon the

son os Taygete, who also gave them the names of Cleta

and Phaenna. These names, indeed, are very properly

given to the Graces, as likewise are those names which

are assigned to the Graces by the Athenians. For the

Athenians have from ancient times venerated the Graces,

Auxo arid Hegemone. And as to Carpus, it is not a name

of one of the Graces, but of one of the Seasons. But

the Athenians worship the other of the Seasons, together

■with Pandrosus, arid call this diviriity Thalloie, or the

jkurijbing. Indeed, we how pray to three Graces, having'

learnt that there are three from the Orchomenian Eteo­

cles. Those, too, that have made statues of Bacchus have
