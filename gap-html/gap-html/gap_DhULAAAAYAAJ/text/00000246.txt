rather say that Homer derived his knowledge respecting the souls

in Hades, and the names of the infernal rivers which it contains,

from the mystic traditions of Orpheus, who instituted the religion

of Greece, and that the rivers called Acheron and Cocytus in

Cichyrus were denominated from their similitude to those of the

same name in Hades. But the reader must not suppose that the

infernal rivers described by Homer are nothing more than the

paradoxical sports of poetical fancy; but, as Proclus on Plato's

Republic beautifully observes, it is proper to believe, that for

those who require chastisement and purification, subterranean

places are prepared, which, from their receiving the various de-

fluxions of the elements above the earth, are called rivers by my-

thologists, and are filled with dæmons who preside over fouls,

and who are of an avenging, punishing, purifying, and, judicial

characteristic Hence, says he, the poetry of Homer is not to be

condemned, when it calls the infernal region a place

"Horrid and dark, and odious to the gods."

For the variety and imagination of the presiding dæmons excite

all this obscurity and horror. I only add, that Acheron is a place

adapted to the purgation of care and sorrow, and which als« cor­

responds to air and the meridional part of the world; but that

Cocytus together with Styx correspond to earth and the

western centre, and punish hatred, through lamentations and,

grief. See more on this subject, in my Introduction to the Phæ-

do of Plato.
