came to Lacedæmon, and could obtain no recompense

from the Spartans,- flew himself. But then Epaminondas

performed funeral rites to Scedasus and his daughters,

and solemnly declared, that he took up arms, not more

this subject did not correspond with that of Epaminondas:

for though Malgis and Xenocrates were of opinion, that

war should be denounced against the Lacedæmonians with
