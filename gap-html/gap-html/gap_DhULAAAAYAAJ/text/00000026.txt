zz THE DESCRIPTION

walls by the harmony of his lyre. But Amphion obtained

his reputation in music, in consequence of having learnt

from the Lydians, through his alliance to Tantalus, the

tydian harmony, and inventing three chords in addition

to the four which had been—already discovered. The

author, however, of the verses upon Europa fays, that

Amphion first learned the use of the lyre, from Mercury,

and that he drew along stones aud wild beasts by his har­

verses and elegies, fays, that Amphion was the first that

raised an altar to Mercury j and that for this he received

a lyre from the god- It is also said that Amphion is

punished in Hades for reviling Latona and her sons. This

punishment of Amphion is mentioned in the poem called

Minyas, and which is composed in common upon Am­

phion and Thamyris.

But after the house of Amphion was destroyed by

pestjlence, and Zethus had fallen a victim to grief, in con­

offence, then the Thebans gave up the government to

J^aius. And Laius, during his reign, married Jocasta.

.He received too an oracle from Delphos, which told him

that if he had a son by Jocasta, that son would be the

mean6 of his death. In consequence of this he exposed

Oedipus as soon as he was born: and Oedipus, as soon as

he arrived at manhood, flew his father, and married his mo­

ther. But that Oedipus had no children by his mother, is

evident from the following verses of Homer in the Odyssey:

There too Jocasta of a beauteous mien

I saw, the fam'd incestuous Tbcban queen;

With her own son flic join'd in nuptial bands,
