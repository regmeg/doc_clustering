36 THE DESCRIPTION

cated by Harmonia. These were made front the beak»

of the ships of Cadmus. One of these they call Ctlejlial

Venus, the second Popular, and the third Apojlrophia.

Harmonia gave these names to Venus; the epithet Ce­

lestial, signifying pure love, and that which is liberated

from the desire of body; the epithet Popular, alluding to

venereal congress; and Apojlrophia, signifying that this

goddess turns the race of men from unlawful desire and

impious coition. For Harmonia knew, that many impious

actions both among the Barbarians and Greeks were com­

mitted through intemperate desire; such as afterwards were

celebrated in verse, of the mother of Adonis, of Phædra .

the daughter of Minos, and of the Thracian Tereus. But

they fay that' the temple of Ceres Thesmophoros was

once the house of Cadmus and his posterity. The statue

of Ceres in this temple is only apparent as far as to the

breast. Brazen shields are fixed in this place, which they

fay belonged to the Lacedæmonian noblemen that fell in

the b.-rtle at Leuctrai Near the gates called Proetæ there

is a theatre: and very near the theatre there is a temple

of Lysian Bacchus. For u lien formerly the Thracians led

away many captives from the Thebans, Bacchus freed

them from their bond:-, when they came near the borders

of the Haliartians, and enabled them to slay the Thra­

cians when oppress with sleep. 1 he Thebans, too, fay

that the other statue which is in this temple is the statue

of f-emele. Once every year, on stated days, they open

this temple. Here likewise there are ruins of the house

of Lycus, and a sepulchre of Semele; for it is not the

sepulchre of Alcmene; as, according to report, she was

changed after her death into a stone. For the Thebans

• do not give the fame account of her as the Megarenses.
