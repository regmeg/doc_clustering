victims, and while he beholds them, prophesies whether or

not Trophonius will propitiously receive the person who

consults him. The other victims do not in a similar manner

disclose the mind of Trophonius: but each person who

descends to him, sacrifices, on the night in which he de­

scends, a ram in a ditch, invoking at the fame time Aga-

medes. They pay no regard to the former entrails, even

though they should be favourable, unless the entrails of

this ram are likewise auspicious. And when it happens

that the entrails thus correspond in signification, then the

person that wishes to consult Trophonius descends with

good hope, and in the following manner: The facrificers

bring him by night to the river Hercyna; there they

anoint him with oil; and two boys belonging to the city,

each about thirteen years old, and whom they call Mer­

curies, wash him, and supply him with every thing ne­

cessary.

He is not immediately after this led by the facrificers

to the oracle, but is first brought to the fountains of the

river, which are very near to each other. Here he is

obliged to drink of that which is called the water of Lethe,

that he may become oblivious of all the former objects of

his pursuit. Afterwards he must drink of another water,

which is called the water of Mnemosyne, or memory, that

he may remember the objects which will .present them­

selves to his view on descending into the grove. Having

therefore beheld the statue, which they say was made by

Dædalus (and which the priests never shew to any but

those who desire to consult Trophonius), performed cer­

tain religious ceremonies, and prayed, he proceeds to the

oracle clothed in white linen, begirt with fillets, and

having on his feet such flippers as arc worn by the na­

tives
