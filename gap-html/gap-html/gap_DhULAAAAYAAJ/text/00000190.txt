i7<5 THE DESCRIPTION

• CHAP. XXVI.

AbOVE those women which are between Æthra and

Nestor, other captives are painted, viz. Clymene, Creusa,

Aristomache, and Xenodice. Stesichorus, in his . poem

on the destruction of Troy, ranks Clymene among the

captives. In 'a similar manner the poet Ennus fays, that

Aristomache was the daughter of Priam, and that she was

taken from the Greeks, and restored to liberty by the

Mother of the Gods and Venus, and that flie was the wife

of Æneas. Lescheus, however, and the author of the

Cyprian verses, fay that Eurydice was the wife of Æneas.

are painted reclining on a bed. The name of one of these

only is mentioned in the poem called the Small Iliad:

and it appears to me, that Polygnotus invented the other

names. Here too Epeus is painted, throwing down the

walls of Troy from their foundations. And the only

thing above these is the head of the horse Durateus. Poly-

poetes likewise the son of Pirithous is painted, having his

head bound with a fillet. Acamas the son of Theseus

stands by him with a helmet on his head, and a CTest

on the helmet. Ulysses too is present, and is invested

with a coat of mail. Ajax the son of Oileus approaches

with a shield to the altar, in order to swear before he

offers violence to Cassandra. But Cassandra fits on the

ground,
