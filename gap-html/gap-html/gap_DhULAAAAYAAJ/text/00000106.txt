92 THE DESCRIPTION

phonius and Hercyna, as they arc of opinion, that dragon^

are no less sacred to Trophonius than to Æsculapius.

Near the river too there is a sepulchre of Arcesilau*.

They say that Leitus brought the bones of Arcesilaus from

Troy. But the most remarkable particulars in the grove

are a temple of Trophonius, and a statue, which may be

conjectured to be that of Æsculapius. This statue was

made by Praxiteles. There is also a temple here of Ceres

Europa: and in the open air there is a temple of Jupiter

Pluvius,

As you ascend to the place from which the oracle

is given, and pass on to the anterior part of the moun­

tain, you will fee a temple of Proserpine the huntress

and Jupiter the king. This temple, either through its

magnitude, or through unceasing wars, was left half

finiQied. In another temple which stands here there are

statues of Saturn, Juno, and Jupiter. There is also in

this place a temple of Apollo. With respect to what per­

tains to this oracle, when any one desires to descend into

the ca*e of Trophonius, he must first take up his resii

dence for a certain number of days in a building destined

to this purpose. This building is a temple of the Good

Damon, and of Guod Fortune. While he stays here he pu­

rifies himself in other respects, and abstains from hot

baths. The river Hercyna is used by him for a bath:

and he is well supplied with animal food from the vic­

tims which are sacrificed. For he who descends hither,

sacrifices to Trophonius and his sons; to Apollo, Sa­

turn, and Jupiter the king; to Juno the rhariot drhi-rt

and to Ceres, whom they call Europa, and who they

fay was the nurse of Trophonius. A diviner in present

to each of the sacrifices, who inspects the entrails of th^.

victims!
