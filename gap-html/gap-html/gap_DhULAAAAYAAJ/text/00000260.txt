e46 NOTES ON THE

fion of the external air. From whence it appears that this lamp

had continued to (hine for about 1550 years. The historian,

Pancirollus, who mentions this lamp, is a respectable author, and

relates it as a well-known fact, in his curious book, entitled, Con足

cerning memorable Things known to the Antients, but now-

lost.

Saint Austin too (De Civitat. Dei, I.21. cap. 6.) fays, that

a lamp was found in a temple dedicated to Venus, which was

always exposed to the open weather, and could never be con足

sumed, or extinguished. And Ludovicua Vives, his commen足

tator, mentions another lamp, which was found a little before his

time, that had continued burning for 1050 years.

A very remarkable lamp was discovered about the year 1500,

near Atestes, a town belonging to Padua in Italy, by a rustic,

who digging deeper than usual, sound an earthen urn, contain足

ing another urn, in which last was a lamp placed between two

cylindrical vessels, one of gold, and the other of silver, and each

of which was full of a very pure liquor, by whose virtue, it is

probable, the lamp had continued to (hine for upwards of 1500

years; and, unless it had been exposed to the air, might have

continued its wonderful light for a still greater period of time.

This curious lamp was the workmanship of one Maximus Oly-

bius, who most probably effected this wonder by a profound

skill in the chymical art. On the greater urn some verses were

inscribed in Latin, which may be translated as follows:

I.

Plund'rers, forbear this gift to touch,

'Tis awful Pluto's own:

A secret rare the world conceals,

To such as you unknown.

II.

Olybius in this slender vase

The elements has chain'd;

Digested with laborious art,

From secret science gain'd.
