i74 THE DESCRIPTION

and Panthalis, the latter of whom stands by Helen, and

the former is represented fastening the shoes of her mis-

tr.ss. These names too are different from .those which arc

adopted by Homer in the Iliad, where he describes Helen

and her maids on the walls of Troy. A man clothed in

purple, and extremely sorrowful, sits above Helen: and

before you read the inscription, you may easily conjecture

that this is Helenus. Near Helenus Meges stands. His

arm is wounded, agreeably to the account given of him

by Lescheus Pyrrhæus, the son of Æschylenus, in his poem

on the destruction of Troy. This Lescheus informs us,

that he was wounded by the Argive Admetus in that

battle which the Trojans fought in the night. Lycomedes

the son of Creon stands near Meges. He is represented

wounded in the wrist : and, according to Lescheus, he re­

ceived this wound from Agenor. It is evident, therefore,

thatPolygnotus would not have painted him in this manner,

unless he had read the poetical compositions of Lescheus.

Lycomedes likewise received two wounds besides this, one

in the foot, and the other in the head: and these Poly-

gnotus has represented in the picture. Euryalus, too, the

son of Mecisteus, appears with two wounds, one in the

head, and the other in the wrist. All these are above

Helen in the picture. After Helen, Æthra the mother of

Theseus is painted, with her hair (haven off to her skin;

together with Demophon the son os Theseus, who is re­

presented considering whether it is possible for him to

save Æthra. The Argives fay, that Melanippus was the

son of Theseus by the daughter of Synnis, and that he

conquered in the race, when those who are called the

Epigonoi established the second Nemean games after

Adrastus.
