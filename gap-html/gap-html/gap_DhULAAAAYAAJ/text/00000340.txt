3i6 NOTES" ON THE

for the fashioning of certain parts, wax and clay are used. Often,

too, celestial fire is made to appear through magic: and then

statues laugh, and lamps are spontaneously enkindled."

This curious passage throws light on the following from the

first book of the Metamorphoses of Apuleius i "Magico su-

surramine, amnes agiles reverti, mare pigrum colligari, vent»s

inanimes expirare, solem inhiberi, lunam despumari, ilellas evelli,

diem tolli, noctem teneri." That is, "By magical incan­

tation, rapid rivers may be made to run back to their foun­

tains, the sluggish sea be congealed, winds become destitute of

spirit, the sun be held back in his course, the moon be forced to

purge away her foam, the stars be torn from their orbits, the

day be taken away, and the night be detained." For it maybe

inferred from Psellus, that witches formerly were able to cause

the appearance of all this to take place. I only add, that this

MS. of Psellus On Demons forms no part of his treatise On

the Energy of Damons, published by Gaulminus; for it never wag

published.

gias Plato thus speaks in the Phædrus: "But shall we suffer

Lysias and Gorgiai to sleep, who placed probabilities before

realities; and, through the strength of their discourse, caused

small things to appear large, and the large small; likewise old

things new, and the new old; and who besides this discovered a

concise method of speaking, and again a» infinite prolixity of

words?"
