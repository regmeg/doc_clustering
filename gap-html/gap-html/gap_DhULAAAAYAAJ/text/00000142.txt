128 THE DESCRIPTION

doubtful. The Argives, however, being of opinion that

they should vanquish their enemies, sent a brazen horse

to the statue os Durius at Delphos: and this horse was

rnade by the Argive Antiphanes.

CHAP. X.

On the basis under this horse there is an inscription,

which signifies that statues were dedicated here from the

■ tenth of the spoils of the battle at Marathon. These sta­

tues are Minerva and Apollo; and of the commanders,

Miltiades. But of those that are called heroes, Ercchtheus,

Cecrops, and Pandion: Celeus likewise, and Antiochus

the son of Hercules, by Midea the daughter of Phylas, ro-

. gether with Ægeus •, and of the sons of Theseus, Acamas.

These, in consequence of a Delphic oracle/ gave names

to the Athenian tribes. Here too there arc statues of

Codrus the son of Melanthus, Theseus and Phyleus, who

were not ranked among the surnames. All these statues

were made by Phidias, and are in reality the tenths of the

Marathouian battle. Afterwards they sent Antigonus

and his son Demetrius, and the Egyptian Ptolemy, to

Delphos; the latter on account of their .benevolence

towards him; and the two former, through fear. Other

gifts of the Argives may be seen not far from this

horse, viz. those lenders who together with Polynices

warred on Thebes; Adrastus the son of Talaus, and Ty-

deus the son of Oencus: the grandsons likewise of Proe-

tus, together with Capancus the son of Hipponous, and

Eteocles the son of Iphis: and besides these, Polynices,

and Ilippomcdcn who was the son of the sister of Adras­

tus.
