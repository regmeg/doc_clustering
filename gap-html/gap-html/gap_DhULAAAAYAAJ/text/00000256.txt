242 NOTES ON THE

ing natures which the world contains. Proclus farther informs

us in MSS. Schol. in Cratylum, "that this goddess is called

Victory, and Health; the former, because (he causes intellect to

rule over necessity, and form over matter; and the latter, because

she preserves the universe perpetually whole, perfect, exempt from

age, and free from disease. It is the property therefore of this

goddess to elevate and distribute, and through an intellectual

dance, as it were, to connect, establish, and defend inferior na­

tures in such as are more divine." n aSvta NIKH srgoo-ayojiuilai xai

reason why some statues were called by the ancients Diopeteis,

is (fays Jamblichus apud Phot. p. 554) "because the occult

art by which they were fabricated by human hands, was

inconspicuous."

Page 75. Callimachus made for the Jlatue of the goddess a lamp

of golds which, when filled with oil, burns day and night for the

space of a year, fife, j The ancients with great propriety dedi­

cated a burning lamp to Minerva, as (he is the goddess of Wis­

dom: for as truth is light itself, and has a most intimate alliance

with wisdom,it is impossible that any corporeal substance can more

aptly symbolize with wisdom than sensible light. Hence Ascle-

pius Trallianus in Schol. MSS. in Nicom. Arithmet. Isagogeu.

beautifully derives the etymon of <ropi« wisdom from to eras i;

the perspicuous and clear. But for the fake of the liberal reader
