tus. Amphiaraus too is dedicated here, with his chariot,

which is placed near him. Baton stands in this chariot,

who was the charioteer of Amphiaraus, and at the fame

time allied to him by his birth. The last of these is

Alitherfes. The artificers of all these were Hypatodorus

and Aristogiton: and they fay that the Argives dedicated

them out of the spoils of the victory, which, through the

assistance of the Athenians, they gained over the Lacedæ­

monians in Oenoe, an Argive city. It appears to me too,

that the Argives dedicated out of the fame spoils the

images of those who are called by the Greeks Epigonoi,

or posterior sons. For statues of these are placed here, viz.

Sthenelus,and Alcmæon, who in my opinion was honoured

above Amphilocus, on account of his age. To these are

added, Promachus, Thersander, Ægialeus, and Diomed.

Euryalus too stands between Diomed and Ægialeus.

Opposite to these there are other statues, which were

dedicated by the Argives, when they assisted Epami-

nondas the Theban general in restoring the Messenians.

There are likewise images here of heroes, viz. king Da-

naus, who arrived at the highest degree of power and

wealth in Argos: Hypermnestra, because she was the only

■one of his daughters that had pure hands: and near her

Lynccus, and all those who derive their origin from Her­

cules, and still higher from Perseus. There are besides

brazen horses of the Tarentines, and captive women,

which the Tarentines sent in consequence of having con­

quered the Mcssapians, who are a barbarous nation bor­

dering on the Tarentines: and these are the works of

the Argive Ageladas. The Lacedæmonians indeed colo­

nized Tarentum under the command of the Spartan

Phalanthus, whoj when he was feat on this errand, was
