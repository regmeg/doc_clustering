22S NOTES ON THE

It is remarkable that, according to the first of these passages,

the second Venus was produced from foam in the fame manner

as the first, as Proclus proves from the authority of the Orphic

writings: for this information is not to be gathered from any

other writer that 1 am acquainted with. Nor need it seem

strange, that this should be mentioned by no ancient author

prior to Proclus: for before the establishment of the Christian

religion, the Orphic writings were deservedly held in such great

veneration, from containing the ceremonies of a mode of wor­

ship coeval with the universe, that the less mystic parts of them

were but seldom cited, and the most mystic, not at all. As Pro­

clus, therefore, was the man that unfolded the theology and phi­

losophy of the Greeks in the most consummate perfection, and

this at a period when the ancient religion was almost entirely

extirpated, and the Orphic writings were considered as sacred but

by a few, we cannot wonder at meeting with this, and much

similar information in the works of this incomparable man.

It appears to me, that the great confusion and absurdity with

which modern explanations of the fables of the ancients are re­

and ignorance of the secret meaning of ancient fable. Thus, in

the present instance, most of the moderns would, I am persuaded,

consider this story about Theseus, as at bottom merely historical,

though it is in fact one of those ancient fables which are replete

with the most philosophical and mystic information. At present,

indeed, it does not seem to be even suspected by any one, that

the theology of the Greeks, when viewed in its genuine purity,

is a thing the most sublime and scientific that the mind of maa

can possibly devise; and that consequently, as the Grecian fables

are the progeny of this theology, they cannot fail of being re­

markably scientific and sublime. That the reader therefore,

whose mental eye is not so darkened by oblivion, as to exclude
