178 THE DESCRIPTION

held the image of this coat of mail in the picture of

Polygnotus And in the temple of Ephesian Diana, Cal-

liphon the Samian has painted certain women adapting

the hollow parts of a coat of mail to Patroclus. Polygnotus

likewise has painted in this picture Laodice standing be­

yond the altar. I do not know of any poet that has

mentioned her among the Trojan captives; and it ap­

pears to me very probable that she was dismissed by the

Greeks. Homer, indeed, in the Iliad, evinces that Mene-

laus and Ulysses were entertained by Antenor, and that

Laodice was married to Helicaon the son of Antenor.

Lescheus asserts, that Helicaon being wounded in the noc­

turnal engagement, was known by Ulysses, and freed from

the danger of the fight. It may therefore be easily be­

lieved, that neither Agamemnon nor Menelaus would act

in an hostile manner towards the wife of Helicaon. How­

ever, Eupherion Chalcidensis asserts things respecting

Laodice, which are utterly void of probability. Aster

Laodice there is a stone prop, on which there is a brazen

laver. Medusa sits on the ground, holding this prop with

■both her hands. Any one may rank Medusa among the

daughters of Priam, who has read the ode of Himeraeus.

Near Medusa there is an eld woman with her hair shaven,

to the skin; or perhaps this may be an eunuch. She

holds a naked infant on her knees: and the infant is re­

presented hcjding his hand before his eyes, through fear.
