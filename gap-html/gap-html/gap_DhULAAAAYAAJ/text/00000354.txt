340 NOTES ON THE

"According to ancient theologifts, Jupiter is referred to Saturn,

Saturn to Heaven, and Heaven to the most ancient Ophlon, of

whom there is no original." The Scholiast on the Prometheus

of Æschylus fays nearly the fame. This most ancient god

Ophion is therefore, as it appears to me, the fame with the Or­

phic dragon, the original of all things: for Ophion is doubtless

derived from ofi,- ophit, a serpent. But of this dragon, Damas-

cius, in his treatise mci a.pxu'i On Principles, gives the following

account: "I likewise find in the Orphic rhapsodies, that the

theology neglecting the two first principles (viz. æther and

chaos) together with the one principle who is delivered in

silence (i. e. the first cause) establishes the third principle pos­

terior to the two as the original; because this first of all possesses

something essable and commensurate to human discourse. For

in the former hypothesis, the highly reverenced and undecaying

Time, the father of æther and chaos, was the principle; but in

this Tims is neglected, and the principle becomes a dragon/'

See more from Damascius, on the most interesting of all sub­

jects, In my Introduction to the Paimenides of Plato. I only

add, that the Ophion with whom Eurynome is co-ordinate in

the fame manner as Rhea is with Saturn, must be considered as

a procession from the Ophion who is the fame with the Orphic

dragon.
