fire. The fourth temple of Apollo is said to have been

built of stone, by Trophonius and Agamedes: and this

was burnt when Erxiclides was the Athenian archon, and

in the first year of the fifty-eighth Olympiad, in which

Diognetus Crotoniatcs was victor. But the temple which

exists at present was raised by the Aniphictyons out of

their sacred money ; and its architect was the Corinthian
