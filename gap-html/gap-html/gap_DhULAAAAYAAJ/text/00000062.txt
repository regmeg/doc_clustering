48 THE DESCRIPTION

Clipped. With respect to the two temples of Mercufy*

one of which is called the temple of Criophoros, or the bearer

of the ram, and the other of Pramochos, or the defender,

they fay that the first of these was thus denominated, be­

cause Mercury freed them from a pestilence, by carrying

a ram round the walls; and that on this account Calamis

made a statue of Mercury for the Tanagræans, carrying a

ram on his shoulders. He who surpasses in beauty the

other youths, carries, on the festival of Mercury, a ram

on his shoulders round the walls. But they fay that Mer­

cury was called Promachos, because, when the Eretrienses

from Eubcca came with a fleet against the Tanagræans,

this god led forth the youth to battle, and, being himself

armed with a curry-comb like a young man, was the prin­

cipal cause of putting the Eubceenses to flight. In the

temple of Promachos the remains of a purflain-tree are

dedicated, because, as they fay, Mercury was educated

under trees of this kind. Not far too from hence there

is a theatre, and near it a porch is raised. In this parti­

cular indeed the Tanagræans appear to me to reverence

the gods in a manner superior to the rest of the Greeks,

because they are careful to build their temples separate

from other edifices, in a pure place, and remote from the

multitude.

In a celebrated part of the city there is a sepulchre of

Corinna, who alone composed verses for the Tanagræans.

In the gymnasium too there is a picture of her, in which

her head is represented bound with a fillet, on account of

her having vanquished at Thebes, Pindar, in the composing

of verses. It appears to me, however, that she vanquished

htm by reason of the dialect which she employed, because

ter verses were not composed in the Doric dialect like
