146 THE DESCRIPTION

was Curnamed Hercules by the Ægyptians and Libyans.

Nothing more remarkable is related of the father of Sar-

dus, Maceris, than that he once came to Delphos. Sardus

brought a colony of Libyans to Ichnussa; and hence the

island came lo be called after the name of Sardus. This

colony of Libyans did not exterminate the natives. The

natives however associated with the new inhabitants more

through necessity than regard. The Libyans too, at that

time, were as ignorant in the art of building cities, as

the native inhabitants of this island : and hence, they dwelt

in straggling cottages, and in caverns. Some years after

the Libyans had settled here, those Grecians that followed

Aristæus came into this island. They fay that Aristæus

was the son os Apollo and the nymph Cyrene, and that

having bitterly lamented the misfortune of Actæon, and

being hated by Bceotia and all Greece, he migrated to

Sardinia. Some too are of opinion, that Dædalus fled

at the fame time through fear of the Cretan arms, and

that he assisted Aristæus in bringing a colony into Sar­

dinia.' There is however no probability, that Dædalus

could be the companion of Aristæus, either in establishing

a colony, or in any other undertaking, as Aristæus was

married to Autonoe the daughter of Cadmus, and Dædalus

was contemporary with Oedipus king of Thebes.

Aristæus, however, and the Grecians that followed him,

did not build any city, because, as it appears to me, they

were neither numerous nor strong enough for this pur­

pose. After Aristæus the Ibcri passed over into Sardinia

under the command of Norax, and built a city which

they called Nora. They fay that this city was the first

that was built in this island; and that Norax was the son

•f Mercury by Erythca the daughter of Geryon. A fourth
