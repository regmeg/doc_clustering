habitants of this place were sacrificing, they became so

outrageous through intoxication, that they flew the priest

afflicted with a pestilent disease; and at the same time

were ordered by the Delphic Oracle to sacrifice to Bacchus

proximity to the temple of Jupiter the higheji. Besides

these gates there is another gate which is called Ogygia;

and the last gate is denominated Omolois. It appears to
