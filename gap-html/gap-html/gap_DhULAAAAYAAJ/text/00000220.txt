to6 THE DESCRIPTION

fled to Abæ, and set on fire the temple which had been

before half burnt by the Persians. And hence, at present

this temple is in the most ruinous condition of all the

buildings which have been injured by fire. For this temple,

which had been injured by the Persian fire, was afterwards

injured in a still greater degree by that of the Bœotians.

Near this great temple there is another temple, which is

not so large: and this was dedicated by the emperor

Adrian to Apollo.

The Abæans however have statues more ancient than

their temples, and which they themselves dedicated. Al

these statues are brazen, are in an erect position, and are

Apollo, Latona, and Diana. The Abæans too have a

theatre and a forum, both which are of ancient work­

manship. But on returning into the straight road to Opus,

you will arrive at Hyampolis. The name of this city in­

dicates the origin of its inhabitants, and the place from

which they fled to this country. For the Hyantes being

vanquished by Cadmus and his associates, fled from Thebee

into these parts. And at first, indeed, their city was

called by the neighbouring people the city of the Hyantes;

but in process of time it came to be denominated Hyam­

polis. This city was burnt by Xerxes, and afterwards en­

tirely subverted by Philip. Yet notwithstanding this, the or­

naments of the ancient forum still remain—a Bouhuterion,

or place of consultation, and a theatre not far from the gates.

But the emperor Adrian built a porch here, which bears his

name. The inhabitants of this city have but one well; and

they have no other water besides this, either for bathing

or drinking, except the rain water which they collect in

winter. They venerate too Diana beyond all the divini­

ties; and they have a temple of this goddess. But I am
