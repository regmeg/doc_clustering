OF GREECE. 215

Amphisla, the daughter of Macareus the son of Æolus,

and who was beloved by Apollo.

This city is adorned with many excellent pieces of

■workmanship; but the monuments of Amphisla and An-

drærnon deserve to be mentioned beyond all the rest. They

say that Gorge, the wise os Andrxmon, and daughter of

Oeneus, is buried here with Andræmon. But in the tower

there is a temple of Minerva; and in it an erect brazen

statue. They say that this statue was brought by Thoas

from Troy, and that it belonged to the Trojan spoils.

This however I cannot believe. For in the former part of

this work, I have fliewn that the Samians, Rhcecus the

son of Philaeus, and Theodorus the son of Telecles, were

the first that found out the art of casting brass. But I

have not yet been able to find any of the works of Theo­

dorus which consist of brass. But in the temple of Ephe-

fian Diana, as you approach to that cell which contains

certain pictures, you will fee above the altar of Diana, who

is called Protothronia, a stone inclosure. Upon this in­

closure there are other statues, and an image of a woman

near its extremity. This statue was made by Rhcecus;

and the Ephesians call it Night. The statue therefore of

Minerva in Amphisla is more ancient in its appearance,

and the art displayed in its fabrication is less polilhed.

The Amphissenses too celebrate the mysteries of the

youths who are called AnaEles. Of these gods there arc

various opinions. For, according to some, they are the

Dioscuri; according to others, the Curetes; and a still

greater number think that they are the Cabiri. These

Locrians too have other cities. Thus, above Amphissa, and

towards the continent, is the city Myonia. This city is

P4 distant
