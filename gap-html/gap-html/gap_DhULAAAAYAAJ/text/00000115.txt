OF GREECE. loic

by Vulcan. Above the city Chxronea there is a preci­

pice, which is called Petrachos. They are of opinion

that Saturn was in this place deceived by Rhea, when he

swallowed a stone, instead of Jupiter. On the summit of

the mountain there is a small statue of Jupiter. In this

part of Chæronea the inhabitants make an ointment, by

boiling together roses, lilies, narcissuses, and the herb iris,

orszvord-grass : and this is a remedy against pain. If, in­

deed, you anoint wooden statues with the ointment of

roses, you will preserve them from rottenness. The iris

grows in marshy places, and is equal in size to the lily;

but its colour is not white, and it does not emit so strong

an odour as the lily.
