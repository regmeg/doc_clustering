44 THE DESCRIPTION

Tanagræans fay, that their city was built by Poemandrus,

the son of Chærefilaus, the grandso n of Iafius, and the

great grandson of Elemher, who was the son of Apolio

and Æthusa the daughter of Neptune. This Poemandrus

married Tanagra the daughter of Ædlus ; though Corinna

in her verses fays, that Tanagra was the daughter of Aso-

Tanagra; and, in process of time, this name was given

to the city, and remained so long, that it is mentioned by

Homer ii„ his catalogue of the Greeks:

In after-times, however, it recovered its pristine name.

rtountain Cercyius, in Which they fay Mercury was born.

say Atlas fat, diligently investigating subterranean and

celestial affairs. And that Homer, agreeable to this, fays

of Atlas:.

"Atlas, her sire, by whose all-piercing eye

The depths of ev'ry sea are clearly seen,

And who the lofty pillars strenuous rears,

Which ev'ry way divide the earth from heav'n."

made by Calamis. The statue of Triton, however, is still

more wonderful: and there is a more venerable report

concerning him, which is as follows:— The Tanagrian

women, that were first initiated in the orgies of Bacchus,
