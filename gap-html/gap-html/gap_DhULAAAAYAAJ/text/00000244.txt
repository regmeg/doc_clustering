23« NOTES ON THE

But as every gad beginning from on high produces his pro­

per series as far as to the last of things, and this series compre­

hends many essences different from each other, such as Angelical,

Dæmoniacal, Heroical, Nymphical, and the like, the lowest pow­

ers of these orders have a great communion and physical sym­

pathy with the human race, end contribute to the perfection of

all their natural operations, and particularly to their procreations.

As these heroic souls too have a two-fold form of life, viz. epi-

nionative and cogitative, the former of which is called by Plato in

the Timæus the circle of difference, and the latter, the circle of

sameness, and which are characterised by the properties of male and

female ;-*-hence these souls at one time exhibit a deiform power,

by energizing according to the masculine prerogative of their na­

ture, or the circle of sameness, and at another time according to

their feminine prerogative, or the circle of difference; ytt so,

as that according to both these energies they act with rectitude,

and without merging themselves in the darkness of body. They

likewise know the natures prior to their own, and exercise a pro­

vidential care over inferior concerns, without at the fame time

having that propensity to such concerns which is found in the

bulk of mankind. But the fouls which act erroneously according

to the energies of both these circles, or which, in other words,

neither exhibit accurate specimens of practical or intellectual

virtue—these differ in no respect from gregarious souls, or the

herd of mankind, with whom the circle of sameness is fettered,

and the circle of difference sustains all-various fractures and

distortions.

As it is impossible, therefore, that these heroic souls can act

with equal vigour and perfection, according to both these circles

at once, at this is the province of natures more divine than the

(human, it is necessary that they must sometimes descend and

energize principally according to their opinionative part, and

sometimes according to their more intellectual part. Hence, one

of these circles must energize naturally, and the other be hinder­

ed
