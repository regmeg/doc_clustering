tion ever obtained over another. On the following day

the Lacedæmonians sent heralds to the Thebans, and de­

first of all permit their allies to take away their dead, and

then the Lacedæmonians to bury their own people. As

some of the allies, therefore, had not any dead to take

away, and others had but a few, the Spartans were obliged

to confess that the greatest loss was of their own people.

In this engagement, of the Thebans and such Bœotians as

remained, no more than forty-seven fell; but of the Lace­

dæmonians above a thousand.

suffered them to depart on certain conditions, asserting

leave their city, and fly to Cercssus. This Cercssus is a

fortified town belonging to the Thespians, into which

they formerly betook themselves when they were attacked
