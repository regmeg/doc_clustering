134 THE DESCRIPTION

Even at present there are ruins, in the Trojan mount Ida,

of the city Marpessus ; and it contains about sixty inhabit­

ants. All the country about Marpessus is red, and very

sultry. Hence it appears to me, that the reason why the

river Aidoneus, at one time hides itself in the earth,

again emerges, and at last entirely disappears under

ground, is to be ascribed to the attenuated and cavernous

nature of mount Ida. Marpessus is distant from the

Trojan city Alexandrca about two hundred and forty

stadia. The inhabitants of Alexandrea fay, that Herophile

was the guardian of the temple of Apollo, and that flic

prophesied, in consequence of a dream of Hecuba, such

things as I am very certain afterwards happened. This

Sibyl dwelt the greatest part of her life in Samos: she

likewise came to Delos and Delphos, in which last place

she delivered her oracles on the stone which we have

already mentioned.

She died in Troy: her sepulchre is in the grove of

Sminthcus: and on it there is a pillar with the following

inscription:

I who am buried in this stone sepulchre

Am a Sibyl, a clear interpreter of the will

Of Phoebus:

I was once a vocal virgin, but am now for ever dumb:

And lie thus fettered, through the oppressive power

Of Fate.

I am however placed under the Nymphs and Mercury;

And k is from Apollo that I receive this

Destiny, as the reward of iny ancient

Sacerdotal office.

Near her sepulchre there is a stone.Mercury of a quadran­

gular figure; and on the left hand there is water running

into a receptacle, and near it there are statues of Nymphs.
