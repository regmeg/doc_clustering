with a bow like those in Scythia, and with the skin of a

leopard thrown about her shoulders.

Above Penthefilea there are certain persons carrying

water in earthen urns full of holes. One of these re­

sembles a virgin in the flower of her youth, but the other

appears to be more advanced in age. There is no inscrip­

tion on each of these women; but a common inscription

on them shews that they are of the number of the unini­

tiated. The women that are above these are, Callisto

the daughter of Lycaon, Nomia, and Pero the daughter

of Neleus, For this last, Ncleus demands an ox of Iphi-

clus as a sponfal gist. Callisto has the hide of a bear for

her bed-covering; and her feet are placed on the knees of

Nomia. I have before shewn that, according to the Ar­

cadians, Nomia was one of the nymphs belonging to

their country. According to poets, indeed, nymphs live

a great number of years, but yet are not entirely exempt

from death. After Callisto and the women that are with

her, there is a representation of a precipice, to ^he sum­

mit of which Sisyphus the son of, Æolus endeavours to

roll a stone. In the fame part of the picture there are a'

large vessel, an old man, a boy, and women sitting on a

stone. One of these, of the same age with the old man,

stands by him; but the others are carrying water. You

may conjecture that the old woman is pouring out the

remains of the water from the perforated vessel, into the

large vessel again. It appears to me, that these person*

despised the Eleufinian mysteries. For the more ancient

Greeks considered these mysteries as much superior in

dignity to all other institutions, which lead to piety, as

gods are to heroes. Below this large vessel, Tantalus is

represented suffering those punishments wluch are men­

tioned
