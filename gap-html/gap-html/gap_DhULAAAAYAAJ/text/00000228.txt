5ii4 THE DESCRIPTION

I will relate all that I have heard. When Orestheus th.9

son of Deucalion reigned in this country, a bitch was de­

livered of a piece of wood, instead of a whelp. This

piece of wood Orestheus buried in the ground ; and they

fay, that in the following spring a vine was produced,

from it, and that from the wood of its branches (ozci) the

people were called Ozo/a. Others again fay, that Nessus,

who carried the wife of Hercules over the river Evenus,

did not immediately die of the wound which he received

from Hercules, but fled to this country j that he died

here; and that the air became noxious from the filthy

odour of his dead body. There is likewise a third report,

that a foetid vapour was exhaled from the water of a cer­

tain river; and a fourth, that this country abounds with

asphodel, and that the smell of it was very predominant.

It is also said, that the first inhabitants of this place were

autochthones, or earth-born; and that, in consequence of their

not having yet learnt to weave garments, they used to

cover their bodies, as a defence from the cold, with the

recent skins of wild beasts; at the fame time turning the

hairy part of the hide outwards for the fake of ornament.

And hence the smell of their bodies necessarily resembled

that of the skins. But Aniphifla is about one hundred and

twenty stadia distant from Delphos, and is the largest and

most celebrated city of the Delphi. The inhabitants pf

this city have joined themselves to the Ætolians, in con­

sequence of being ashamed of the name of the Ozolæ.

Indeed, it is probable that Augustus Cæsar subverted the

country of the Ætolians, in order to people Nicopolis, and

that he caused a great part of them to migrate to Am-

phissa. However, these people originated from the Lo-

prians j and their city (as they fay) was denominated from

Amphissa,
