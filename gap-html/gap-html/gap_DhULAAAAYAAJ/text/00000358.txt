244 NOTES ON THE

lody of the pipe; and on tins account Plato dots not admit it

in his republic. But the reason of this is the variety of this

instrument, the pipe, which evinces that the art employing it

ought to be avoided. For instruments producing every hind of

harmony, and that instrument which consists of many chords, are

imitations of pipes; for every hole of the pipe emits (at they

fay) three sounds at least; but if the cavity above the holes of

the pipe should be opened, then each hole wonld fend forth more

than three sounds." Olympiodorus too, in MS. Comment, in

Phædonem, observes as follows concerning this pipe, o xoifr,i

gives pipes to the Trojans, but by no means to the Greeks. For

who is the guardian deity of the Athenians, who alone know

how to argue, threw away the pipes."

siod, p. 90, beautifully observes, concerning the pillars of

Atlas, that they signify his being allotted powers which in an

undeviating manner separate the heaven from the earth; so that

the former revolves perpetually in an exempt manner about the

latter; but earth bung stably fixed in the middle, brings forth

every thing maternally, which the heavens generate paternally."
