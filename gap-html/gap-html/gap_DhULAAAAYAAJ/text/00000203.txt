OF GREECE. 189

other Ajax is looking at them while they are playing. The

colour of this Ajax is that of a sea-faring man ; .and his

body is yet wet with the foam of the sea. Polygriotus

seems to have collected the enemies of Ulysses into one

place. But the reason why Ajax the son of Oileus hated

Ulysses, was because Ulysses advised the Greeks to stone

Ajax to death, for the daring wickedness of his conduct

towards Cassandra. I know too from the Cyprian verses,

that Palamedes, when he once went a-fifhing,was drowned

by Ulysses and Diomed. A little above Oilean Ajax, Me- .

leager the son of Oeneus is painted, and appears to be

looking at Ajax. All these except Palamedes have beards.

With respect to the death os Meleager, Homer informs

us, that he was destroyed by one of the Furies, through

the imprecations of Althæa. But the poem called the great

Eoea, and likewise the verses which are denominated

MinyaSy fay, that the Curetes were assisted by Apollo

against the Ætolians, and that Meleager was flain by

Apollo. With respect to the firebrand, too, as that it was

given by the Fates to Althæa, that Meleager would ne­

cessarily die when it was consumed by fire, and that Al­

thæa in a sit of anger burnt it—these particulars were

first of all described by Phrynichus the son of Polyphrad-

mon, in the drama Pleuron:

"Dcstin'd to a horrid fate

Through his vengeful mother's hate;

Through her machinations dire,

lie wa", picre'd to death by fire,

By a brand's devouring flame,

Kindled by the fraudful dame."

However, Phrynichus does not fay much respecting

this affair, which it might be supposed he would have

done,
