306 NOTES ON THE

Cretan words fpilt^sweet, and y-afn< a -virgin: and according to

Bochart, the latter of these words is derived from the Arabic

maratb.

lona.

Page 294. EnotUan Hecate] Diana, according to Festus, was

called Enodia, because she presides over ways. We have before

observed that there is a wonderful union between Hecate and

Diana; and hence Proclus in his common hymn, which has been

already cited in these notes, calls Hecate Prothyrtif, which, as

we are informed by Diodorus, is one of the appellations of

Diana.

came to be thus denominated from a place in Arcadia where (he

had a temple.

Page 301. Sprinkled with human Mood.] If we attend to the

pre-existence of human fouls, and consider the crimes which they

may have committed in former periods of existence on the earth,

and at the fame time consider that nothing escapes the pene­

trating eye of providence, and that all its administrations are con-

consummately just, the apparent cruelty in the injunction of this

oracle vanishes. For of what consequence is it whether a man

who deserves to die is flain before an altar, or put to death in a

common way? And we may be sure that no man is punished ei­

ther with death or the loss of his possessions, or is in short op­

pressed with any calamity, unjustly. For though the conduct of

such a one in that period of his existence in which he suffers may de­

serve a milder destiny, yet it may be safely concluded that in some

past period of existence, it has been such as to demand the pu­

nishment which he endures. It must however be observed, that

this doctrine does not hold good with respect to truly worthy

men, by which I mean those heroic souls of whom I have given

an account in a former note; for the calamities which befall

others, when they happen to these, are sent by divinity as purifi­

cation*
