OF GREECE. 127

dam us the Cnldian, Cimmerius the EpheGan, Æantides

the Milesian succeed. All these were made by Tisander.

These that follow were made by Alypus the Sicyonian,

viz. Theopompus the Midean, Cleomedes the Samian;

from Eubœa, Aristocles the Carystian, Autonomus the

Eretrienfian, Aristophantus the Corinthian, Apollodorus

the Troezenian: and from Epidaurus in the borders of the

Argives, Dion. Next to these are the Achaian Axio-

nicus from Pellene, Theares from Hermione, Pyrias from

Phocis, Conon from Megara, Agimenes from Sicyon,

Pythodotus the Corinthian, Telecrates the Leucadian,

and Euantidas from Ambracia. Lad of all follow the

Lacedæmonians, Epicyridas and Eteonicus. They fay

that these were made by Patrocles and Canachus. But

the Athenians affirm, that the loss which they suffered at

Ægospotamos happened to them unjustly, in consequence

of the commanders of their army being bribed. For they

fay that Tydeus and Adimantus received presents from

Lyfander: and in proof of this they adduce the following

Sibylline oracle: " And then shall high-thundering Ju­

piter, who possesses the greatest strength, severely afflict

the Athenians: for he will bring war and destruction on

their ships, which will perish through the fraudulent con­

duct of their commanders.'' They likewise produce the fol­

lowing testimony from the oracles of Musæus: " A mighty

storm shall burst on the Athenians, through the baseness

of their leaders; but they will be consoled for (heir mis­

fortune, by subverting the city of their enemies, and

avenging the loss which they sustained." And thus much

concerning tlii- affair. But the lame Sibyl predicted, that

the event of the engagement which tock place between

the Lacedæmonians anj Argives above Thyrea, would be

doubtful.
