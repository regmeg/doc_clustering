CHAP. III.

In the tenth year after the temple was plundered, Philip

brought this war which is called Phocic and sacred to

an end. At that time Theophilus was the Athenian

archon, and it was the first year of the one hundred and

eighth Olympiad, in which the Cyrenæan Polycles was

victor in the stadium. The following Phociean cities

were then taken, and levelled with the ground, viz. Lilaea,

Hyampolis, Anticyra, Parapotamii, Panopeus, and Daulis.

The names of these cities were renowned in former times,

and afe celebrated in no small degree in the poems of

Homer. But the Phocæan cities Erochus, Charadra,

Amphiclea, Neon,Tethronium, and Drymæa, which were

burnt by the army of Xerxes, became through this cir­

cumstance more known to the Greeks. All the other

cities except Elatea were obscure prior to this war, viz.

the Phocic Thracis, Medeon, Phocicus, Echedamia, Ara-

brysus, Ledon, Phlygonium, and Sterrhis. All these cities

which we have enumerated were then destroyed, and, ex­

cept Abas, were reduced to the form of villages. For the

Abæans were free from the impiety of the other cities,

and had neither plundered the temple of Apollo, nor en­

gaged in the war. The Phoccnses too are forbidden the

use of the Delphic temple, are not admitted as members

of the general assembly of the Greeks, aud the Amphic-

tyons have taken from them the privilege of voting, and

transferred it to the Macedonians. Some time after this

the Phocrean cities were rebuilt, and the Phocenses rc-

i turned.
