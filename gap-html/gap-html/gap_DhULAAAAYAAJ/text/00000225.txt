CHAP. XXXVII. ,

On the right hand of the city, and about the distance of

two stadia from it, thers is a lofty rock, which is a part

of a mountain. On this rock there is a temple of Diana;

from Anticyra through the continent I do not know that

there is any road; for between Anticyra and Bulis there

are mountains which arri both steep and rough. From

Anticyra to the port, a distance of one hundred stadia in­

tervenes. But from the port to Bulis, I conjecture the

Bulis which deserve much admiration. They have how­
