6 the description

entering this temple, you will fee a statue of Rhea pre-;

senting Saturn with a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes,

instead of the child of which she had been delivered. They

call Juno, Teleia, or the perfect. There is a large statue

of the goddess in an upright position: both these sta­

tues are made of Pentelican stone, and are the works of

Praxiteles. There is another statue of Juno in a sitting

posture in the same temple; and this wa§ made by Cal-

limachus. But they call the goddess Numpheuemenc, or

espoused, on the following account.

CHAP. III.

TliEY fay, that Juno being angry with Jupiter, on,

what account it is not known, retired to Euboea; and

Jupiter not being able to appease her, came to Cithæron,

who then reigned over the Platæenses. This Cithseron

was not second to any one in craft. He therefore per-;

suaded Jupiter to make a statue of wood, to phee it veiled

in a car drawn by two oxen, and publicly assert that this

was Flatæa, the daughter of Asopus, whom he was going

to marry. As soon as Juno heard this, she immediately

came to the car, and, cutting off the veil, perceived that

what stie supposed was a new married lady, was nothing

more than a wooden image; and in consequence of this-'

became reconciled to Jupiter. In remembrance of this

reconciliation, they celebrate a festival which is called

Dædal, because the ancients called wooden statues Dæda­

lian. But it appears to me that this name was usurped,

before Dædalus the son of Palamaon was born; and that

afterwards, from Dædalian statues Dædalus derived his

name.
