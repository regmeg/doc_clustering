OF GREECE. 87

he received the following oracle: " OErginus, son of Cly.

menus, and grandson of Presbon, thou earnest hither

late, inquiring after an offspring, but even now add a

pew top to the old tail of the plough."

In conformity therefore to the admonition of the ora­

cle, Erginus married a young woman, by whom he had

Trophonius and Agamedes; though it is said that Tropho-

nius was the son of Apollo, and not of Erginus; which,

indeed, I can easily be persuaded to believe, and this mult

be the opinion of any one who goes to the oracle of Tro­

phonius. They fay, that these sons of Erginus, as scon

as they arrived at manhood, became very skilful jn build­

ing temples for the gods, and palaces for kings. For they

built the temple of Apollo in Dclphos, and the treasury

of Hyrieus. In the wall of this treasury they placed one

stone in such a manner, that they could take it out when­

ever they pleased; and in consequence of this, they were

perpetually carrying away some part of the deposited trea-f

sure. This silled Hyrieus with astonishment, as he found

that the locks and seals had not been moved, and yet the

amount of his wealth was perpetually diminished. On

the vessels, therefore, in which his money was deposited,

he fixed traps, or something of this kind, by which any­

one that attempted to touch the money might be imme­

diately caught. Hence Agamedes, when he entered the

treasury, was held fast in the snare : and Trophonius fear­

ing lest, when it was day, his brother would be forced by

torments to confess that he was his associate in the theft,

cut off the head of Agamedes. After this Trophonius was*

swallowed up in an opening of the earth, in the grove

of Lebadea, where there is a ditch, which is called after^

Agamedes^ with a pillar raised ov$r it. Ascalaphus and
