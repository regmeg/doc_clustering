18 THE DESCRIPTION

vented other things destructive to their prosperity, ant!

laid a fine on half their land; for which conduct this

was his pretext: "When the war against Mithidrates

commenced, Sylla was in great want of money. Hence,

he collected together the sacred offerings from Olympia

and Epidarus; and from the temple of the Delphic

Apollo, all that was left by the Phoccnses. This treasure

he distributed among his .soldiers. But to the gods, in­

stead of the riches which he had taken from them, he

gave the half of the Theban land. The Romans, how­

had been taken from them. But in other respects they

were reduced by Sylla to a very calamitous condition.

And even at present the lower city is entirely desolate,

except the temples of the gods : but the Thebans dwell in

their tower, which is no longer called Cadmea.

CHAP. VIII.

When you have passed over the Asopus, and have

proceeded to about the distance of ten stadia from the

city, you will arrive at the ruins of Potniæ, among which

there is a grove of Ceres and Proserpine. The statues

near the river are called by the inhabitants the goddesses

Potnije. At stated times they perform other established

ceremonies in honour of these, and send sucking pigs

into buildings which they call Megara. These pigs, they

fay, are seen at Dodona on the summer of the following

year: which report may perhaps be credited by some.

There is here too a temple of Bacchus Aigobalas, or the

piercer
