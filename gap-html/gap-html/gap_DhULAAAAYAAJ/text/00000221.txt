not able to describe her statue, because they only think

proper to open the temple twice a year.

They say that such victims as are selected for Diana

are not afflicted with any disease, and grow fatter by feed­

ing than other cattle. But not only the road to Delphos,

or Daulis, through Panopeus, leads from Chæronea to

Phocis, and to the road which is called Scissa ; but another

road, which is rough, and for the most part mountainous,

conducts you from Chæronea to a city of the Phocenses,

which is called Stiris. The length of this road is about

one hundred and twenty stadia. The inhabitants of this

city fay, that they were formerly Athenians, and that

being expelled the Attic land, together with Peteus the

son of Orneus by Ægeus, they settled in this place. They

add, that the city was called Stiris, because a great part

os those that followed Peteus belonged to the Stirienscs

But the habitation of the Stirienses is in an elevated and

rocky place; and hence in summer they are in want of

water. For they have neither many wells, nor is th»

water which they afford fit to be drunk. It serves how­

ever for baths, and supplies beasts of burthen with drink.

The inhabitants indeed fetch the water which they drink

from a fountain which is about four stadia distant from

the town, and which is dug out of a rock. They are there­

fore obliged to descend in order to obtain this water. In

Stiris too there is a temple of Ceres, who is called Stiritis.

This temple is raised from crude tiles; but the statue of

the goddess is made of Pentelican stone, and has torches,

in its hands. Near it there is another statue, which is

ancient, and adorned with fillets.
