i66 THE DESCRIPTION

lay aside their fear, and promised them that he would de­

fend his own. The Grecian cities that fought on this oc­

casion in order to take vengeance on the enemies of the

god were these*: The Phocenses from all their cities;

four hundred henvy-armed soldiers from Amphissa. From

the Ætolians, a few only assembled at first, when they

were told of the march of the Barbarians, but afterwards

Philomelus led one thousand two hundred. Of the Æto­

lians, such as were the most vigorous turned themselves

to the army of Acichorius. They did not however come

to any engagement with the Gauls, but molested the rear

of their army as they were marching, plundered their

baggage, and flew those that defended it. And by this

means the march of the Barbarians was impeded. But

Acichoiius left a part of his forces at Heraclea, for the

purpose of defending the riches in his camp The army

of Brennus, therefore, was opposed by the Greeks that

assembled together at Dclphos. And the god at this time

shewed that he was adverse to the Barbarians, by prodigies

the most conspicuous of any that we are acquainted with.

For all that part of the earth which was occupied by the

army of the Gauls, was violently shaken for the greater

part of the day, and this was accompanied with continued

thunder and lightning. The Gauls in consequence os this

were greatly terrified, and rendered incapable of hearing

the orders of their commanders. The lightning too that

destroyed any individual, burnt at the fame time those

that were near him, together with their arms. Besides all

this, the spectres of heroes were then seen—Hyperochus,

Laodocus, and Pyrrhus •, and the fourth of these, accord­

ing to the Delphi, was Fhylacus, who was a native of

their city.
