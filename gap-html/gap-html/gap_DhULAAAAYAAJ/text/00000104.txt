po THE DESCRIPTION

a considerable part of the country. The Thebans fay, that!

the river Cephissus was turned by Hercules into the Orcho-

menian plains; and that prior to this it ran into the sea,

under a mountain ; hut that Hercules closed up the chasm.

Homer indeed knew of the lake Cephissis, but he does

not fay that it was the work of Hercules. For thus he

speaks concerning it:

"Inclining o'er the lake Cephiffis"

Nor is it probable, that the chasm was not discovered by

the 'Orchomenians, and that Hercules, by separating it,

restored to the river its ancient passage, since even in the

Trojan times they were in, no want of money. This

is evident from what Homer represents Achilles saying

in answer to the ambassadors of Agamemnon:

"Not all the wealth Orchomenus receives."

It is clear from hence, that the Orchomenians were supÂ­

plied with gTeat riches at that time. But, as they fay, As-

plcdcn was then deprived of inhabitants through scarcity

of water. They add, that the city was denominated from

Aspledon, who was the son of Neptune by the nymph

Midea. This account is confirmed by the verses which

they fay were made by Cherfias the Orchomcnian:

"Afpktlen, in an ample city bern,

Fr^m Neptune and th' illustrious Mida sorting."

The verses however of this Cherfias are not now extant i

and the above lines ere cited by Calippus in his oration

on the Orchomeni.ms. They likewise assert, that the

epigram on the sepulchre of HeGod was composed by

Cherfias.
