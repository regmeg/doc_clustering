session: but Latona and Diana appease the anger of

Apollo, and Minerva that of Hercules. This too was the

gift of the Phocenses, which they dedicated at that time

when the Elean Tellias led the '1 hessalians against them.

The other statues were made in common by Diyllus and

tripod. A golden tripod supported by a dragon of brass

was the gift of the Greeks in common, for the victory
