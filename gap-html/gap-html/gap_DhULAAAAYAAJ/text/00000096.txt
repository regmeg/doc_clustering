*2 THE DESCRIPTION

placed three Graces in the hands of the god, just al

Angelion and Tectæus have done to the Delphic Apollo.

And at Athens, in the vestibule of the tower there are

three Graces, whose mysteries, which are kept secret from

the multitude, are there celebrated. But Pamphus is the

first we are acquainted with, that celebrated the Graces

in verse : but he neither mentions their number, nor their

names. Homer too makes mention of the Graces, and

fays that one of these is the wife of Vulcan, and that her

name is Charis. He also fays, that Sleep is the lover of

the Grace Pasithea: and in the speech of Sleep, he has

the following verse:

"That flic my lov'd-one (hall be ever mine,

The youngest Grace, Pasithea the divine."

Hence some have suspected that Homer knew os other

But Hesiod in the Theogony (if that work be the com­

position of Hesiod) fays that the Graces are the daughters

of Jupiter and Eurynome, and that their names are Eu-

phrosyne, Aglaia, and Thalia. Onomacritus, too, in his

verses gives them the fame names. But Antimachus neither

mentions the number, nor the names of the Graces, but

only fays, that they are the daughters of Aigle and the

Sun. Hermesianax the writer os elegies fays, what no

one before him ever asserted, that Pitho, or persuasion, is

one of the Graces. But I have not been able to find, who

the first person was, that either by a statue or picture re­

presented the Graces naked. For the more ancient statues

and pictures of the Graces have garments. Thus among

the Smyrnxans in the temple of the Nemefcs, among the

other statues, there are Graces fashioned of gold, which
