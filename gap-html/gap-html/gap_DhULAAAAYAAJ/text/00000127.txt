OF GREECE.

CHAP. V.

On again turning from Daulis, and proceeding in a

straight line to Delphos, you will fee on the left hand

a building which they call Phocicon, and into which the

Phocenfes from each of their cities assemble. This build­

ing is very large ; and in it there are pillars placed accord­

ing to its length. From the pillars too there are steps to

each of its walls: and on these steps' the Phocenfes fit

his right hand there is a statue of Juno, and on his left

of Minerva. Proceeding from hence, .you will arrive at

a road which they call Schifte, or cut; and in this road

Oedipus murdered his father. Indeed, every part of

Greece contains some monument of the calamities of

Oedipus. For as soon as he was born, his parents bored

the soles of his feet, and exposed him on the mountain

Cithasron belonging to the Platæcnfes. Corinth, and the

country about the Isthmus, educated him. Phocis, and

the road Schiste, were polluted with his father's blood.

And the Thebans are rendered infamous by the mar­

riages of Oedipus, aud the base conduct of Eteocles-

middle of a place where, three roads meet, and select

stones are piled in a heap over them. They fay, that
