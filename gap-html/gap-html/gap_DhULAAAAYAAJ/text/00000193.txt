CHAP. XXVtl.

TH respect to the dead bodies in the picture, one

of them is Pelis, who is naked, and is thrown on his fide.

Beneath him Eioneus and Admetus lie, having on their

coats of mail. Lescheus informs us, that Eioneus was llain

by Neoptolemus, and Admetus by Philoctetes. Above

these theje are other dead bodies. Under the laver Leo-

critus the son of Polydamas lies, who was slain by Ulysses.

Above Eioneus and Admetus is Corœbus the son of

Mygdon. There is a noble monument of this Mygdon

in the borders of the Ectorean Phrygians: and from him

poets denominate the Phrygians, Mygdonians. Corœbus

came to the wedding of Cassandra; and, according to

general report, was slain by Neoptolemus. Lescheus fays

that he was slain by'Diomed. Above Corœbus are Priam,

Axion, and Agenor. Lescheus informs us, that Priam was

not slain at the altar of Hercean Jupiter, but being dragged

from the altar was beheaded by Neoptolemus, when he

met him before the doors of the palace. With respect to

Hecuba, Stesichorus, in his potm on the destruction of

Troy, fays that flie was transported by Apollo to Lycia. But

Lescheus fays, that Axion was the son of Priam, and that,

he was slain by Eurypylus the son of Eusemon. The fame

poet too asserts that Neoptolenlus slew Agenor. And

hence it appears, that Echcclus the sort of Agenor was

slain by Achilles, and Agenor himself by Neoptolemus.

Sinon the companion of Ulysses and Anchialus arc car­

rying out the dead body of Laomedon. Another dead

body is painted here, whose name is Eresus. I do not
