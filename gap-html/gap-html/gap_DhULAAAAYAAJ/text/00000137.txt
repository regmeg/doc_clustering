enumerated, only joins this convention at stated periods.

On coming into the city, you will fee temples in a con-r

tinued series. The first of these is in a ruinous condition;

the second is without statues; the third has images of the

Roman emperors, but these are not numerous 5 and the

fourth is called the temple of Minerva Pronoia. But of

the statues which are in the vestibule of this temple, there

is an offering of the Maflilienfes, which is larger than the

you will fee the river Plisius. This river runs into

Cirrha, a haven of the Delphi, and the sea which is in

that part. But on ascending from the gymnasium to the

femple, you will see on the right hand of the road, the
