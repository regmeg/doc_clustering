OF GREECE. 6j

was lamented by every barbarous nation; and among the

Egyptians there is a song which the Greeks call Linus:

for this song is denominated by the Egyptians Manerem,

But the Greeks, and among these Homer, mention this

song as Grecian. For Homer, being well acquainted with

the misfortune of Linus, fays that Vulcan represented,

among other things, in the shield of Achilles, a boy play­

ing on a harp, aiid singing the fate of Linus:

"To these a youth awakes the warbling strings,

Whole fender ky the fate of Linus sings."

But Pamphus, who composed the most ancient hymns for

the Athenians, fays, that grief for the death of Linus in­

creased to that degree, that he came to be called Oitolinos,

or lamentable Linus. And afterwards the Lesbian Sappho,

having learnt the name Oitolinos from the verses of Pam­

phus, celebrates in her poems Adonis and Oitolinos. The

Thebans too boast that Linus was buried in their coun­

try; and they fay, that after the loss of the Greeks at

Chæronea, Philip the son of Amyntas, in consequence of

a vision in a dream, brought the bones of Linus to Mace­

donia ; and afterwards, from another dream, carried back

the bones to Thebes. The covering however of this tomb,

and every thing else belonging to it, have, they say, been

obliterated through length of time. The Thebans like­

wise assert, that there was a junior Linus, the son os Isme-'

nius; and that when but a boy he was slain by Hercules,

whom he instructed in music. However, neither the

Linus the son of Amphimarus, nor he who was the son of

Ismenius, composed any tlung in verse; or, if they did, it

has not been transmitted to posterity.
