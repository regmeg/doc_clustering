OF GREECE,

CHAP. XXXIX.

Th E Phocenses border on the Orchomenians in that

part which is near the mountains: but Lebadea borders

on them in that part in which the plains arc situated.

This city was formerly built in the more elevated part of

the country, and was called Midea from the mother of

Aspledon. But when Lebadus came from Athens, and

settled here, the inhabitants descended into the plains, and

from him the city was called Lebadea. They neither

however know who his father was, nor on what account

he came hither. They only know that his wife was Nice.

This city is adorned in every respect similar to the most

flourishing cities of Greece. The grove of Trophonius is

separated from it: and they say that Hercyna, playing in

this place with the daughters of Ceres, unwillingly let a

goose fall out of her hands, which afterwards fled into a

Cavern, and concealed itself under a stone: that Proser­

pine came into the cavern, and took the bird from under

the stone: and that in the place where she had moved the

stone water burst forth, which became a river, denomi­

nated from this circumstance Hercyna. Near the banks

of this river there is a temple of Hercyna; and in it there

is a statue of a virgin holding a goose in her hands. The

fountains of the river are in the cavern, torether with

statues in an upright position: and dragons are rolled

round the sceptres of these statues. Any one would be

inclined to conjecture, that these are the statues of Æscu­

lapius and Hygia; but they may be the statues of Tro­

phonius
