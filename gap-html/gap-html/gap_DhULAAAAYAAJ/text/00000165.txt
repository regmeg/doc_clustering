OF GREECE. i5t

made a vow to Apollo, that if by repelling the enemy

they were able to free their country from danger, they

would send every day a solemn procession to Delphos,

and immolate a certain number of victims. However,

after they had conquered the Sicyonians, and in conse­

quence of this sent every day a solemn procession to the

god according to their vow, they sound the expence to

be prodigious, and the fatigue attending it greater than

the cost. Hence, they devised a subtle mode os accom­

plishing their vow, and this was by dedicating a brazen

sacrifice and procession to Apollo. Here too there is a

representation of the achievement os Hercules respecting

the hydra, which was both dedicated and made by Tisa-

goras. As well Hercules as the hydra is of iron. To make

statues indeed of iron, is a thing of the most difficult

and laborious nature: but this work of Tifigoras, who­

ever he was, is really admirable. In Pergamus likewise

there arc iron heads of a lion and a boar dedicated to

Bacchus, which demand no small degree of admiration.

ThcPhocians that inhabit Elatea, being freed from the

liege of their city by Cassander (Olympiodorus, who was

sent by the Athenians for this purpose, giving them assist­

ance), dedicated to the Delphic Apollo a brazen lion. But

the statue of Apollo which stands very near this lion, was

made out of the tenth of the spoils which the Massilienses

took from the Carthaginians, when they vanquished them

in a naval engagement. The Ætolians dedicated here a

trophy, and a statue of an armed woman (viz. Ætolia);

and this out of the money which they took from the

Gauls, for their cruelty to the Callienses. The golden

jjnage in this temple was dedicated by Gorgias the Leon-

tine, and is an image of Gorgias himself.
