3o8 THE DESCRIPTION

CHAP. XXXVI.

But from Stiris to Ambryssus there is a plain roads

which is about sixty stadia in length. Between the moun­

tains here there is a plain : and there are many vines in the

plain, and plants called hysgini. Brambles too grow here

without intermission as well as vines. This bramble the

Ionians and the rest of the Greeks call coccos, ot the grain

with which scarlet it dyed: but the Gauls above Phrygia

call it in their native tongue Ut. Its magnitude is nearly

the fame with that of the white thorn, but its leaves are

blacker and softer than those of the bulrush. In other

respects, however, it resembles the bulrush. Its fruit it

similar to that of the solanum or nightshade, and its mag­

nitude is equal to that of bitter vetches. In the fruit too

of the coccos a small animal breeds; and this animal, if

it finds a passage to the air when the fruit is ripe, imme­

diately takes wing, and exhibits the appearance of a gnat.

But now before the animal can be conceived they gather

the fruit of the coccos. The blood too of this insect is use­

ful for the purpose of dying wool. But Ambryssus is situ­

ated under mount Parnassus; and the Delphi are beyond

it. They fay that the city was denominated from the hero

Ambryssus. TheThebans, in the war against Philip and the

Macedonians, surrounded Ambryssus with a double wall j

and, in raising it, used the stone which this place abounds

with, and which is of a black colour, and very strong.

The measure of the circumference of each wall is but little

Ihort of two paces; but the altitude of each is about two

paces
