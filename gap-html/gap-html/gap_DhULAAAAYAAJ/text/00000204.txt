done, if it had been his own invention. And hence it

appears to me, that he just mentions this circumstance

as a thing well known to all Greece. In the lowest parts

of the picture, after the Thracian Thamyris, you will fee

Hector fitting with both his hands on his left knee, and

exhibiting the appearance of a man oppressed with sorrow.

After him is Memnon sitting on a stone; and close by

him is Sarpedon leaning with his face on both his hands.

But one of the hands of Memnon is placed on the shoulder

river Choaspes; having vanquished all those nations which

are situated between Susa and the Choaspes. The Phry­

gians too, even at present, shew a road through which he

led his army at that time when he was selecting the

shortest passages. This road is cut through desert places.

Above Sarpedon and Memnon, Paris is painted, as yet a

looking at Paris; and by her countenance she appears to

despise him, and to consider him as a man of no estima­

tion. But the figure of Penthesilea is that of a virgin,
