W'l DECLINE AND FALL [CHAP. XLI»

post had given way, the Romans, and Rome itself, were

irrecoverably lost. This perilous day was the most glo­

rious in the life of Belisarius, Amidst tumult and dis­

may, the whole plan of the attack and defence was dis­

tinctly present to his mind; he observed the changes of

served on foot; and this divided force was incapable of

contending with their adversaries, whose lances and ar­

rows, at a distance, or at hand, were alike formidable,,

The consummate skill of Belisarius embraced the favour­

able opportunities: and as he chose the ground and the

moment, as he pressed the charge, or sounded the re­
