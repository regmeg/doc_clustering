After the fall of the Roman empire in the west, an a.d. 476

interval of fifty years, till the memorable reign of Justi- —

nian, is faintly marked by the obscure names and im­

perfect annals of Zeno, Anastasius, and Justin, who

successively ascended the throne of Constantinople.

During the same period, Italy revived and flourished

under the government of a Gothic king, who might

have deserved a statue among the best and bravest of

the ancient Romans.

Theodoric the Ostrogoth, the fourteenth in lineal Birth and

descent of the royal line of the Amali,1 was born in the of Theodo-

neighbourhood of Vienna,b two years after the death of a?'d.455

Attila. A recent victory had restored the independence ~47i-.

* Jornandes (de rebus Geticis, c. 13,14. p. 629, 630. edit. Grot.) has drawn the  
pedigree of Theodoric from Gapt, one of the Antes, or demigods, who lived
about

the time of Domitian. Cassiodorius, the first who celebrates the royal race of
the

Amali, (Variar. 8. 5. 9. 25. 10. 2. 11. 1.) reckons the grandson of Theodoric
as the

seventeenth in descent. Peringsciold (the Swedish commentator of Cochloens,
Vit.

Theodoric, p. 871, &c. Stockholm, 1699) labours to connect this genealogy with

the legends or traditions of his native country.

Carnon-

tum, almost on the same spot where Marcus Antoninus composed his meditations
