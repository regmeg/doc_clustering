PREFACE.

Ottoman empire are fashioned by the practice of three hun­

dred years; and we are pleased to blend the three Chinese

monosyllables, Con-ftt-tzee, in the respectable name of Con­

fucius, or even to adopt the Portuguese corruption of Man­

darin. But I would vary the use of Zoroaster and Zerdusht,

as I drew my information from Greece or Persia: since our

connexion with India, the genuine Timwr is restored to the

throne of Tamerlane: our most correct writers have re­

trenched the Al, the superfluous article, from the Koran:

and we escape an ambiguous termination, by adopting Mos­

lem instead of Mussulman, in the plural number. In these,

and in a thousand examples, the shades of distinction are

often minute; and I can feel, where I cannot explain, the

motives of my choice.

•„* At the end of the History, the reader will find a general Index to the
whole

Work, which has been drawn up by a person frequently employed in works of

this nature.
