338 DECLINE AND FALL [CHAP. XH-V.

the most learned civilians of the east, to labour with

thejr sovereign in the work of reformation .b The the­

ory of professors was assisted by the practice of advo­

cates, and the experience of magistrates; and the whole

T"d "aSr Vn^erta^'.nff was animated by the spirit of Tribonian.0

—546. This extraordinary man, the object of so much praise

and censure, was a native of Side in Pamphylia; and his

genius, like that of Bacon, embraced, as bis own, all the

business and knowledge of the age. Tribonian com­

posed, both in prose and verse, on a strange diversity of

curious and abstruse subjects'1—a double panegyric of

Justinian and the life of the philosopher Theodotus; the

nature of happiness, and the duties of government; Ho­

mer's catalogue and the four-and-twenty sorts of metre;

the astronomical canon of Ptolemy; the changes of the

months; the houses of the planets; and the harmonic

system of the world. To the literature of Greece he

added the use of the Latin tongue; the Roman civilians

. were deposited in his library and in his mind; and he

most assiduously cultivated those arts which opened the

road of wealth and preferment. From the bar of the

praetorian prefects, he raised himself to the honours of

quaestor, of consul, and of master of the offices: the

council of Justinian listened to his eloquence and wisdom,

and envy was mitigated by the gentleness and affability

of his. manners. The reproaches of impiety and avarice

have .stained the v irtues or the reputation of Tribonian.

* For the legal labours of Justinian, I have studied the preface to the Institutes;  
the first, second, and third prefaces to the Pandects; the first and second
preface to

the Code; and the Code itself, (lib. 1. tit. 17. de Veteri Jure enucleando).
After

these originat testimonies, I have consulted, among the moderns, Heineccius,
(Hist.

J.R. no. 383—404.) Terasson, (Hist. de la Jurisprudence Romaine, p. 295—356.)

Gravina, (Opp. p'. 93—100.) and Ludewig, in hfs life of Justinian, (p. 19—123.

318—321. for the Code and Novels, p. 209—261. for the Digest or Pandects, p.

262—317.) ': ''. ■■<-''

c For the character of Tribonian, see the testimonies of Procopius, (Persic.
lib. 1.

£. 23, 24.' Anecdot. c. 13. 20.) and Suidas. (tow. 3. p. 501.'edit. Kuster.)
Lude­

wig (in Vit.'juttiniajt. p. 175—209.) works hard, very hard, to white-
wash—tlie

black-a-moor.

d I apply the two passages of Suidas to the same man; every circumstance so
ex­

actly tallies. Yet the lawyers appear ignorant; and Fabricibs is inclined to
separate

the two characters. (Bihliot. Graec. tom. 1. p. 341. 2. p. 518. 3. p. 418. 12.
