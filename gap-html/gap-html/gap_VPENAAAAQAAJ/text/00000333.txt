CH'AP. XLIV.] OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

tional pride, both Livy and Dionysius are willing to be­

lieve, that the deputies of Rome visited Athens under

the wise and splendid administration of Pericles; and

the laws of Solon were transfused into the twelve tables.

If such an embassy had indeed been received from the

barbarians of Hesperia, the Roman name would have

been familiar to the Greeks before the reign of Alex­

ander ;5 and the faintest evidence would have been ex­

plored and celebrated by the curiosity of succeeding

times. But the Athenian monuments are silent; nor

Will it seem credible that the patricians should undertake

a long and perilous navigation to copy the purest model

of a democracy. In the comparison of the tables of So­

lon with those of the decemvirs, some casual resem­

blance may be found; some rules which nature and

reason have revealed to every society; some proofs of A

common descent from Egypt or Plxenicia.' But in all

the great lines of public and private jurisprudence, the

legislators of Rome and Athens appear to be strangers or

adverse to each other.

Greek repnbiics. (See two Memoires of the Baron de St. Croix, sur la
Legislation de

la Grande Grece; Mem. de l'Academie, tom. 42. p. 276. 533.) But the laws of

Zalencns and Charondas, which imposed on Diodorus and Stobaeus, are the

critical

sagacity of Bentley, (p. 335—377.)

« I seize the opportunity of tracing the progress of this national
intercourse;

1. Herodotus and Thucydides, (A. U. C. 330—350.) appear ignorant of the name
and

existence of Rome. (Josepb. contra Apion. tom. 2. lib. 1. c. 12. p. 444. edit.
Haver-

camp.) 2. Theopompus (A. TJ. C. 400. Flin. 3. 9.) mentions the invasion of the

Gauls, which is noticed in looser terms by Heraclides Ponticus. (Plutarch in
Cam-

millo, p. 292. edit. H. Stephan.) 3. Tie real or fabulous emhassy of the
Romans to

Alexander (A. V. C. 430.) is attested by Clitarcbus, (Plin. 3. 9.) by Aristus
and As-

clepiades, (Arrian. lib. 7. p. 294, 295.) and by Memnon of Heraclea, (apud
Photium,

cod. 224. p. 725.) though tacitly denied by Livy. 4. Theophrastus (A. U. C.

1 The tenth table, de mbdo sepulture, was borrowed from Solnn: (Cicero de Le-

gibus, 2. 23—26.) the furtum per lancem et licium conceptuni, is derived by
Het-

neccius from the manners of Athens. (Antiquitat. Rom. tom. 2. p. 167—175.) The
