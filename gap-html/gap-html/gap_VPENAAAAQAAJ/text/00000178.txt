DECLINE AND FALL [CHAP XLI.

and power: he was declared unworthy of his race, his

nation, and his throne; and their general Vitiges, whose

valour had been signalized in the Illyrian war, was rais­

longer be profaned by the triumph or toleration of Arian-

ism; that the tombs of the Cassars should no longer be

trampled by the savages of the north; and, without reT

fleeting that Italy must sink into a province of Constan­
