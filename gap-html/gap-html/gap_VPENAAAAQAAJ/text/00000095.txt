CHAP. XL.] OP THE ROMAN EMPtRE.

people; his victory was displayed by the immediate res­

toration of their enemy; and they felt above ten years,

under his oppressive administration, that he was stimu­

lated by revenge, rather than instructed by misfortune.

Their murmurs served only to fortify the resolution of

Justinian; but the prefect, in the insolence of favour,

provoked the resentment of Theodora, disdained a power,

before which every knee was bent, and attempted to

sow the seeds of discord between the emperor and his

but the friendship of the emperor alleviated his disgrace,

and he retained, in the mild exile of Cyzicus, an ample

portion of hi& riches. Such imperfect revenge could

not satisfy the unrelenting hatred of Theodora; the

murder of his old enemy, the bishop of Cyzicus, afforded

a decent pretence;, and John of Cappadocia, whose
