DECLINE AND FALL [cHAP. XI/.

senators of blameless integrity. After this popular con­

cession, Justinian proceeded to the hippodrome to con­

fess his own errors, and to accept the repentance of his

grateful subjects; but they distrusted his assurances,

though solemnly pronounced in the presence of the holy

gospels; and the emperor, alarmed by their distrust, re­

treated with precipitation to the strong fortress of the

palace. The obstinacy of the tumult was now imputed

to a secret and ambitious conspiracy, and a suspicion was

entertained, that the insurgents, more especially the

green faction, had been supplied with arms and money

by Hypatius and Pompey, two patricians, who could nei­

ther forget with honour, nor remember with safety, that

they were the nephews of the emperor Anastasius.

Capriciously trusted, disgraced, and pardoned, by the

jealous levity of the monarch, they had appeared as loyal

servants before the throne; and, during five days of the

tumult, they were detained as important hostages; till at

length, the fears of Justinian prevailing over his pru­

dence, he viewed the two brothers in the light of spies,

perhaps of assassins, and sternly commanded them to de­

part from the palace. After a fruitless representation,

that obedience might lead to involuntary treason, they

retired to their houses, and in the morning of the sixth

day, Hypatius was surrounded and seized by the people,

who, regardless of his virtuous resistance, and the tears

of his wife, transported their favourite to the forum of

Constantine, and, instead of a diadem, placed a rich collar

on his head. If the usurper, who afterward pleaded the

merit of his delay, had complied with the advice of the

senate, and urged the fury of the multitude, their first

irresistible effort might have oppressed or expelled his

trembling competitor. The Byzantine palace enjoyed a

free communication with the sea; vessels lay ready at the

garden stairs; and a secret resolution was already formed,

to convey the emperor with his family and treasures to a

safe retreat, at some distance from the capital.
