DECLINE AND FALL [CHAP. XL IJ

rights of private property were infringed by the strong

plea of the public safety. It might easily be foreseen

that the enemy would intercept the aqueducts; and the

cessation of the water-mills was the first inconvenience,

which was speedily removed by mooring large vessels,

and fixing millstones in the current of the river. The

stream was soon embarrassed by the trunks of trees,

and polluted with dead bodies ; yet so effectual were the

precautions of the Roman general, that the waters of the

Tiber still continued to give motion to the mills and

support, without impatience, the privation of her public

was justified by the increase of the public distress, as

of the country on the right of the Tiber, and the best

communication with the sea; and he reflected with grief

and anger, that three hundred men, could he have spared

such a feeble band, might have defended its impregnable

works. Seven miles from the capital, between the Ap足

pian and the Latin ways, two principal aqueducts, cross足
