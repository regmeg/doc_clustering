CHAP. XL.] OF tHE ROMAN EMPIRE. 85

rous particles; and the orator declared, in tragic style

to the senate, that a mere mortal must yield to the power

of an antagonist, who shook the earth with the trident of

Neptune, and imitated the thunder and lightning of Jove

himself. The genius of Anthemius and his colleague Isi­

dore the Milesian, was excited and employed by a prince,

whose taste for architecture had degenerated into a mis­

chievous and costly passion. His favourite architects

submitted their designs and difficulties to Justinian, and

discreetly confessed how much their laborious medita­

tions were surpassed by the intuitive knowledge or celes­

tial inspiration of an emperor, whose views were always

directed to the benefit of his people, the glory of his

reign, and the salvation of his soul.k

The principal church, which was dedicated by the Foundation

founder of Constantinople to St. Sophia, or the eternal church of

Wisdom, had been twice destroyed by fire; after the exile St'Sopl"*-

of John Chrysostom, and during the Niha of the blue

and green factions. No sooner did the tumult subside,

than the Christian populace deplored their sacrilegious

rashness ; but they might have rejoiced in the calamity,

had they foreseen the glory of the new temple, which,

at the end of forty days, was strenuously undertaken by

the piety of Justinian.1 The ruins were cleared away, a

* See Procopins (de Edificiis, lib. 1. c. 1, 2. lib. 2. o. S.) He relates a coinci­  
dence of dreams which supposes some frand in Justinian or his architect. They

both saw, in a vision, the same plan for stopping an inundation at Data. A
stone-

qaarry near Jerusalem was revealed to the emperor: (lib. 5. c. 6.) an angel
was

tricked into the perpetual custody of St. Sophia. (Anonjm. de Antiq. C. P.
lib. 4.

p. 70.)

'Among the crowd of ancients and moderns, who have celebrated the edifice of
St.

Sophia, I shall distinguish and follow,—1. Four original spectators and
historians:

Procopins (de Tidific. lib. 1. c. 1.) Agathias, (lib. v. p. 152,153.) Paul
Silentiarins,

(in a poem of one thousand and twenty-six hexameters, ad calcem Anns Comnem.

Alexiad.) and Evagrius. (lib. 4. c. 31.) 2. Two legendary Greeks of a later
period:

George Codinus (de Origin. C. P. p. 64—74.) and the anonymous writer of
Banduri,

(Imp. Orient. tom. 1. lib. 4. p. 65—80.) 3. The great Bvzantine antiquarian,
Da-

cange (Comment, ad Paul Silentiar. p. 525—598. and C. P. Christ. lib. 3. p.
5—78.)

4. Two French travellers—the one, Peter Gyllius(de Topograph. C. P. lib. c. 3,
4.)

in the sixteenth; the other, Grelot: (Voyage de C. P. p. 95—164. Paris, 1680.
in

4to.) he has given plans, prospects, and inside-views of St. Sophia; and his
plans,

though on a smaller scale, appear more correct than those of Ducange. I have
adopted

and reduced the measures of Grelot: but as no Christian can now ascend the
dome,

the height is borrowed from Evagrius compared with Gyllius, Greaves, and the

Oriental Geographer.
