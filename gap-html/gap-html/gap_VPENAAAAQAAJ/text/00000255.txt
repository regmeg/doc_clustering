CHAP. XLII.] OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 241

It was the boast of the Colchians, that their ancestors coicUo*;

had checked the victories ofSesostris; and the defeat of the

Egyptian is less incredible than his successful progress,

as far as the foot of mount Caucasus. They sunk, with­

out any memorable effort, under the arms of Cyrus; nnder the

followed in distant wars the standard of the great king, ^Jj^"*'

and presented him every fifth year with one hundred chThx 500 »

boys, and as many virgins, the fairest produce of the

land.8 Yet he accepted this gift like the gold and ebo­

ny of India, the frankincense of the Arabs, or the ne­

groes and ivory of ^Ethiopia: the Colchians were not

subject to the dominion of a satrap, and they continued

to enjoy the name as well as substance of national inde-

pendence.11 After the fall of the Persian empire, Mi­

thridates, king of Pontus, added Colchos to the wide cir­

cle of his dominions on the Euxine; and when the na­

tives presumed to request that his son might reign over nnder the

them, he bound the ambitious youth in chains of gold,

and delegated a servant in his place. In the pursuit of Christ 60.

Mithridates, the Romans advanced to the banks of the

Phasis, and their galleys ascended the river till they

reached the camp of Pompey and his legions.1 But the

senate, and afterward the emperors, disdained to reduce

that distant and useless conquest into the form of a pro­

vince. The family of a Greek rhetorician was permitted

to reign in Colchos and the adjacent kingdoms, from

the time of Mark Antony to that of Nero; and after the

race of Polemo11 was extinct, the eastern Pontus, which
