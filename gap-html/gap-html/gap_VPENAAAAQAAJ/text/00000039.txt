CHAP. XXXIX.] OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

Roman senators still retired in the winter season to the

warm sun and salubrious springs of Baiae; and their vil­

las, which advanced on solid moles into the bay of Naples,

commanded the various prospect of the sky, the earth,

and the water. On the eastern side of the Hadriatic, a

new Campania was formed in the fair and fruitful pro­

vince of Istria, which communicated with the palace of

Ravenna by an easy navigation of one hundred miles.

The rich productions of Lucania and the adjacent pro­

vinces were exchanged at the Marcilian fountain, in a

populous fair annually dedicated to trade, intemperance

and superstition. In the solitude of Comum, which had

once been animated by the mild genius of Pliny, a trans­

parent basin, above sixty miles in length, still reflected

the rural seats which encompassed the margin of the

Larian lake; and the gradual ascent of the hills was co­

vered by a triple plantation of olives, of vines, and of

chesnut trees.1 Agriculture revived under the shadow

of peace, and the number of husbandmen was multiplied

by the redemption of captives.4 The iron mines of Dal-

matia, a gold mine in Bruttium, were carefully explored,

and the Pomptine marshes, as well as those of Spoleto,

were drained and cultivated by private undertakers, whose

distant reward must depend on the continuance of the

public prosperity." Whenever the seasons were less

propitious, the doubtful precautions of forming maga­

zines of corn, fixing the price, and prohibiting the ex­

portation, attested at least the benevolence of the state;

but such was the extraordinary plenty, which an indus­

trious people produced from a grateful soil, that a gallon

Epiphanius of Pavia redeemed by prayer or ransom six thousand captives from
the

Burgundians of Lyons and Savoy. Such deeds are the best of miracles.

* The political economy of Theodoric (see Anonym. Vales, p. 721. and Cassio­  
dorins, in Chron.) may be distinctly traced under the following heads: iron
mine,

(Var. 3. 23.) gold mine, (9. 3.) Pomptine marshes, (2. 32, 33.) Spoleto, (2.
21.) corn,
