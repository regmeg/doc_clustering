that the comet, "from its horrid hair, shakes pestilence

and war."™ Its road in the heavens was observed with

exquisite skill by Flamstead and Cassini; and the ma­

thematical science of Bernoulli, Newton, and Halley,

investigated the laws of its revolutions. At the eighth

period, in the year 2255, their calculations may perhaps

be verified by the astronomers of some future capital in

the Siberian or American wilderness.

B«ft- II. The near approach of a comet may injure or de-

stroy the globe which we inhabit; but the changes on

its surface have been hitherto produced by the action of

volcanos and earthquakes." The nature of the soil may

indicate the countries most exposed to these formidable

concussions, since they are caused by subterraneous fires,

and such fires are kindled by the union and fermenta­

tion of iron and sulphur. But their times and effects

appear to lie beyond the reach of human curiosity, and

the philosopher will discreetly abstain from the predic­

tion of earthquakes, till he has counted the drops of wa­

ter that silently filtrate on the inflammable mineral, and

measured the caverns which increase by resistance the

explosion of the imprisoned air. Without assigning the

cause, history will distinguish the periods in which these

calamitous events have been rare or frequent, and will

observe that this fever of the earth raged with uncom­

mon violence during the reign of Justinian." Each year

is marked by the repetition of earthquakes, of such du­

ration that Constantinople has been shaken above forty

days; of such extent that the shock has been communi-

ta Paradise Lost was published in the year 1667; and the famous lines (lib. 2.

708, &c.) which startled the licenser, may allude to the recent comet of 1664,
