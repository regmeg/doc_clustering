DECLINE AND FALL [CHAP. XLII,

the alliance of the Turks; and the ratification of the

treaty was carried by a Roman minister to the foot of

mount Altai. Under the successors of Justinian, the

friendship of the two nations was cultivated by frequent

succeeding day was more sumptuous; the silk hang­
