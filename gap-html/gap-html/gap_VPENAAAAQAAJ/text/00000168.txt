crown; and imperiously demanded, that the grandson

of Theodoric should be rescued from the dastardly dis­

cipline of women and pedants, and educated, like a

valiant Goth, in the society of his equals, and the glo­

rious ignorance of his ancestors. To this rude clamour,

of submitting to the laws of her country, which held as

a fundamental maxim, that the succession could never

pass from the lance to the distaff, the daughter of Theo­

doric conceived the impracticable design of sharing with
