CHAP. XLII.] OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

Berrhae or Aleppo, Apamea and Chalcis, were succes­

sively besieged: they redeemed their safety by a ransom

of gold or silver, proportioned to their respective strength

and opulence; and their new master enforced, without

observing, the terms of capitulation. Educated in the

religion of the Magi, he exercised without remorse the

lucrative trade of sacrilege; and, after stripping of its gold

to deplore the obstinacy and ruin of that unhappy peo­

ple; but the slaughter still raged with unrelenting fury;

and the city, at the command of a barbarian, was deliver­
