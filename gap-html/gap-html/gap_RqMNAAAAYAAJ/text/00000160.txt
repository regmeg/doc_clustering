and having ravaged the lands adjoining, brought up

his fleet from thence to the city; where, having kept

his soldiers on board the ships during the day, he dis足

embarked them in the night, and led them on to that

part of the wall over which the Romans had entered

when they took the place; for he had a notion that

the garrison was not strong, and that, on seeing a hope

of changing masters, some of the townsmen would

raise a commotion. But those who had fled in a panic

not without their share of the confusion, occasioned by

the drawing up of the ladders, lest the enemy should

fleet had fled back to the mid-ocean, there were found

between the wall and the shore eight hundred men

slain, and two thousand stands of arms.
