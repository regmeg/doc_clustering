tection of Masinissa, he should enjoy the same honor­

able provision which jEsalces had formerly known

under Gala; and to assure Mezetulus not only of im­

punity, but of an intire restitution of all his property.

As they both preferred a moderate share of fortune at

home to exile, he brought them over to his side, not­

withstanding the Carthaginians used every means to

prevent it.

31. During these transactions Hasdrubal happened

to be with Syphax; and when the Numidian seemed

to think that it was of little consequence to him whe­

ther the government of the Massylians were in the
