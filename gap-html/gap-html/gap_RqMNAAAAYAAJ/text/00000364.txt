could give him employment, and at the same time fired

with ambition of obtaining a triumph for his success

against the Gauls, which he knew would be more

easily accomplished in the absence of the consul, who

envied and was enraged against him, came to Rome

unexpectedly, and called a meeting of the senate in the

temple of Bellona; where, after making a recital of

the services which he had performed, he demanded to

be allowed to enter the city in triumph.
