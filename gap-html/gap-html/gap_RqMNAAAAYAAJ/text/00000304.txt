Cornelins and Tiberius Sempronius, and ended in the

seventeenth year, when Cneius Cornelius and Publius

jElius Paetus were consuls. We are told that Scipio

often said afterwards, that the ambition, first of Tibe­

rius Claudius, and then of Cneius Cornelius, was what

prevented that war from ending in the utter destruc­

tion of Carthage. The Carthaginians having been ex­

hausted by the long continuance of the late struggles,

found it difficult to raise the first contribution money,

so that the senate-house was filled with grief and la­

by Hasdrubal Haedus, for laughing in a moment of

public sorrowing, and when he himself was the cause

of their tears, he said: 'If the inward thoughts could

which we fell. And do not imagine that the measures

taken against you by the Romans were dictated merely

by animosity. No great state can remain long at rest.

If it has no enemies abroad, it finds them at home; as

overgrown bodies seem safe from external injuries,

but suffer grievous inconveniences from their own

strength. We feel, it seems, for the public misfor­

affected by them; and none of them stings more

deeply than the loss of money. Thus, when the spoils

were stripped off from vanquished Carthage, and you saw

her left naked among so many armed states of Africa,

not one of you uttered a groan ; now, because a contri­

bution must be made to the tribute out of your private

properties, you lament as if the existence of the state
