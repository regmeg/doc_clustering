HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK XXVIII. 117

entertain a much greater animosity against them than

against the Carthaginians; for, with the latter, the

contest was for empire and glory, almost without re­

sentment, but the former they were called on to punish

both for perfidy and cruelty. That the time was now

come when they were to take vengeance for the hor­

rid murder of their fellow-soldiers, and for the trea­

chery ready to be executed on themselves also, had

they happened to fly to the same place; and, by a se­

vere example, to establish it as a maxim to all future

ages, that no Roman citizen or soldier, in any state of

fortune, should be injured with impunity.' Their rage

being excited by this harangue, they distributed the

scaling ladders to chosen men in each company; and

the army being divided into two parts, one of which

Laelius, lieutenant-general, was to command, they as­

saulted the city in two places at once, striking terror

into the assailed by the twofold danger to which they

were exposed. It was not one leader, or a number of

chiefs, but their own violent apprehensions, in conse­

quence of their guilt, that induced the inhabitants to

make a vigorous defence; they were fully sensible,

and they reminded each other, that ' their punishment,

not a victory, was the object aimed at: that the mat­

ter for present consideration was, where they should

choose to meet death, whether in the field and in fight,

where the chance of war, equal to both parties, often

raises the vanquished, and pulls down the conqueror;

or whether after seeing their city burned and demo­

lished, and after suffering every indignity and dis­

grace, they should expire among chains and stripes,

in the presence of their captive wives and children.'

Therefore, not only those who were of an age to bear

arms, or the men alone, but women and boys added

exertions beyond the strength of their minds or bodies,

supplying with weapons those who were engaged in

the fight, and carrying stones to the walls for others

who were strengthening the works; for beside that

their liberty was at stake, and by which the brave are

powerfully excited, the1 extreme severity of punish-
