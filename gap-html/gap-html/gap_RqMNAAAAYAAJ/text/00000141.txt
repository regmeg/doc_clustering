HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK XXVIII. 125

peaceable country round: and at length they used to

quit their standards without leave, openly, and in the

day-time. In a word, every thing was directed by the

licentious humor of the soldiery, nothing by the rules

and discipline of war, or the commands of the officers.

The form however of a Roman camp was preserved,

merely on account of the hope which they entertained

that the tribunes would be infected with their madness,

and become sharers in their mutiny and revolt. They

therefore permitted them to hold their courts at the

tribunals; they applied to them for the watchword,

and mounted guards and watches in their turn ; and as

they had taken away all the power of command, so, by

submitting from choice to the usual duties, they kept

up the appearance of obedience to orders. But when

they found that the tribunes disapproved and blamed

their proceedings, that they endeavored to put a stop

to them, and openly refused to assist in their designs,

the mutiny then burst out; and having, by violence,

driven the tribunes from their stands, and soon after

from the camp, with the unanimous approbation of the

whole body, they bestowed the supreme command on

Caius Albius of Cales, and Caius Atrius of Umbria,

common soldiers, who were the principal movers of

the sedition. These men, not satisfied with the orna­

ments used by tribunes, had the assurance to lay hold

of the badges of supreme command, the rods and axes;

never considering that their own backs and necks were

in danger from those very rods and axes which they

carried before them to strike terror into others. Their

groundless belief of Scipio's death blinded their under­

standings; and they entertained not a doubt that, on

the news of that event, which would soon be generally

known, the ffames of war would break out in every

part of Spain : that during this confusion money might

be exacted from the allies, and the neighboring cities

plundered; and that the disturbances being general,

and all men acting without restraint, their own beha­

vior would be the less liable to observation.
