HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK XXXII. 379

pushing forward the war with the utmost vigor. Sul-

picius, engaging the king within the territory of Mace­

donia itself, routed and utterly defeated him; and af­

terwards despoiled the most opulent part of his king­

dom. Then, again, when he was in possession of the
