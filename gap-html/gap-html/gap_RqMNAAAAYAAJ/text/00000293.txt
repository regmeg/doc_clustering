HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK XXX. 277

37. The next day the ambassadors being again

called, and, with severe rebukes for their perfidy,

admonished, that, instructed by so many calamities,

they should at length be convinced of the regard due

to the gods, and to an oath, these terms of peace were

prescribed to them:—' That they should live free

under their own laws, should enjoy the possession of

whatever cities, whatever territories, and whatever

boundaries they possessed before the war; and that

the Roman general would, on that day, put an end to

the devastation of their country. That they should

deliver up to the Romans all deserters, fugitives, and

prisoners; and should surrender their ships of war,

except ten, together with all their trained elephants,

and should not train any more. That they should

wage no war, either in, or out of Africa, without the

permission of the Roman people; should make resti­

tution to Masinissa, and conclude a treaty with him;

should supply corn and pay to the auxiliaries, until

their ambassadors should return from Rome. That

they should pay, within fifty years, ten thousand ta­

lents of silver,i by equal payments, according to a

mode laid down in writing, and should give a hundred

hostages to be approved of by Scipio, none younger

than fourteen years or older than thirty. That he

would grant them a truce on this condition: that the

transports which had been captured during the former

truce, together with their cargoes, be restored: if this

were not complied with, they were not to expect either

truce or peace.' When the ambassadors, who were

sent home with these conditions, reported them in an

assembly of the people, Gisgo having stood forth to

dissuade them from accepting the terms, and being

listened to by the multitude, who were as impatient of

quiet, as unfit for war, Hannibal, filled with indigna­

tion on finding objections made and listened to at such

a juncture, laid hold of Gisgo with his hand, and

pulled him down from the place on which he stood.
