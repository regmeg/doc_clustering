HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK XXVII. 55

at the vanquished party presuming to prescribe terms

to their conqueror, said, that 'in listening before to

proposals of peace, or in agreeing to a truce, he had

not been led by any expectation that the jEtolians

would remain quiet, but by his wish to have all the

confederates witnesses that the object of his pursuits

was peace; of theirs, war. Thus, without any thing

being effected towards an accommodation, he dismissed

the assembly, left five thousand soldiers to protect the

Achasans, receiving from them five ships of war, with

which, added to a fleet lately sent to him from Car­

making violent depredations on that fine and fertile

from the exhibition. He marched off with rapidity at

the head of his cavalry, leaving orders for the infantry

to follow; and, while the Romans were straggling at

random, and heavily laden with booty, not apprehend­

ing any danger of the kind, he attacked and drove

them to their ships. Thus the Roman fleet returned

to Naupactus with little cause of triumph for the booty

which they had taken. On the other side Philip, by

the fame of a victory, whatever might be its real im­

portance, gained however over Romans, added greatly

to the lustre of the remaining part of the games; and

the festival was celebrated with extraordinary re­

joicings, to which he contributed also by his popular
