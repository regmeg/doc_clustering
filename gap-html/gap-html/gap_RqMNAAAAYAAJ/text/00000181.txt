HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK XXVIII. 165

teers. Publius Licinius came into Bruttium to the

two consular armies, of which he chose for himself

that which had been commanded by the late consul

Lucius Veturius; he placed Metellus at the head of

the same legions as before, because he thought it

would be the easier for him to transact business with

those who were accustomed to his command: the pre-

of ten ships of war to protect it, sent the rest to Car­

thage, to guard the sea-coast, a report being spread

that Scipio intended to pass over thither. He then

formed an alliance with the Ingaunians, whose friend­
