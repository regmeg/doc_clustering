tation; some, in a panic, deserted the walls, others

hastily agreed to endeavor to gain the favor of the

conqueror, and opened the gates: whereon Masinissa,

having despatched guards to these and other parts of

the fortifications, to prevent any person going out of

the town, gallopped on in full speed to take possession

of the palace. As he entered the porch, Sophonisba,

Syphax's queen, daughter of Hasdrubal the Cartha­

ginian, met him at the door; where, seeing Masinissa

in the midst of a band of armed men, distinguished by

his arms and apparel, and judging rightly that he was

the king, she fell at his knees, and thus addressed

him: 'The favor of the gods, added to your own valor

what the daughter of Hasdrubal, has reason to dread

from a Roman, is manifest to you. If you cannot by

any other means, I implore and beseech you, that you

will, by my death, secure me from the power of the

Romans.' She was remarkably beautiful, and in the

full bloom of youth: so that, while she pressed his

right hand, and implored his protection only so far, as

that she should not be delivered up to any Roman, her

discourse was more like caresses than ifitreaty; and
