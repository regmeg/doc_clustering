trained to making war against the Romans during many-

campaigns in Spain, and rendered famous by a double

victory over them, by the destruction of two of their

armies, and two of their ablest commanders. With

from Spain, and his address in rousing the Gallic clans

to arms, he had much more reason to boast than Han­

field of battle, (and he would take care that they should

not hear sooner,) that another consul, and another

army had arrived, this single circumstance would in­
