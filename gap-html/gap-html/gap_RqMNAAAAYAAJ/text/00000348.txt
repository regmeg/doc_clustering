iug was intirely disconcerted by the manner in which

the Romans made their onset, which was not more

brisk than it was obstinate; for the light infantry, as if

in a general line of battle, after discharging their ja足

velins, carried on a close fight with their swords; and

the horsemen, when they had once made a charge,

stopping their horses, fought, some on horseback, while

others dismounted and intermixed themselves with the

considerable service. The Romans having gained the

victory in open fight, and also escaped the danger of

the ambuscade, retired to their camp. Next day the

consul marched out with all his forces, and offered

battle, placing his elephants (which had been taken in

the Punic war) in the front of the foremost battalions,

and which was the first time that the Romans made
