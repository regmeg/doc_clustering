HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK XXIX. 195

your own sakes, for your honor's sake, not to employ

in any business, either in Italy or in Africa, until you

have first expiated their guilt, lest they atone for the

crimes which they have committed, not by their own

blood merely, but by some public disaster; although,

even at present, the anger of the goddess does not fail

to show itself against both your officers and men. They

have already, more than once, engaged each other iu

pitched battles. Pleminius was leader of one party,

made them suffer every kind of torture usually inflicted

only on slaves, put them to a cruel death, and then

prohibited them the rites of burial. Such penalties

has the goddess exacted from the plunderers of her

temple; nor will she desist from harassing them with

every kind of frensy until the sacred money shall be

because this temple lies without the walls, to remove

the money therein deposited into the city; when a

voice was heard by night, from the shrine, command­

ing them to desist; for that the goddess would defend

her own treasures. This admonition arrested their

hands; yet, when intending to surround the temple
