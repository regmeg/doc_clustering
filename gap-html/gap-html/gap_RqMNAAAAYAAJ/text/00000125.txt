HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK XXVIII. 109

clear day he despatched all the cavalry and light in­

fantry, with orders to charge the Carthaginian outposts;

and immediately advanced himself with the heavy body

of the legions, having, contrary to the expectation both

of his own men and the enemy, strengthened the wings

gether with the light infantry, advanced briskly against

the enemy, while the rest followed them in an oblique

direction. There was a bending in the centre, because

the battalions of Spaniards advanced slower than the

wings, and the wings had already encountered, while
