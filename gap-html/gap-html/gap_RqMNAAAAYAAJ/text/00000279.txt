whom he sent out, being intercepted by the Roman

guards, and brought to Scipio, he gave them in charge

to the military tribunes, with orders to conduct them

through the camp, wherever they chose: he encouraged

them to lay aside fear, and view every thing; and then,

inquiring whether they had taken a satisfactory view of
