used and in the manner of fighting. When the Mace­

donians, in close array, stretched out before them their

long spears against the target fence which was formed

by the close position of their antagonists' shields, and

when the Romans, after discharging their javelins

without effect, drew their swords, these could neither

press on to a closer combat, nor cut off the heads of

the spears; and if they did cut or break off any, the

shaft being sharp at the part where it was broken,

filled up its place among the points of those which

were unbroken, in a kind of palisade. Besides this,

the parts of the wall still standing, covered safely the

flanks of the Macedonians, who were not obliged, either

in retreating or in advancing to an attack, to pass

through a long space, which generally occasions dis­

speedily, nor any means of subsisting in winter, at

such a distance from the sea, and in a country deso­

lated by the calamities of war. He therefore raised

the siege; and as, along the whole coast of Acarnania

and iEtolia, there was no port capable of containing

all the transports that brought supplies to the army,

nor any place which afforded lodgings to the legions,

he pitched on Anticyra, in Phocis, on the Corinthian

gulf, as most commodiously situated for his purpose.

There the legions would be at no great distance from

Thessaly, and the places belonging to the enemy;

while they would have in front Peloponnesus, sepa­

rated from them by a narrow sea; on their rear,
