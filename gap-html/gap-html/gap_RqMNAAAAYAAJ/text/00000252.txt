with the utmost speed, lest the Roman fleet should be

surprised, while attentive only to the siege, and in no

condition for a naval fight: for how could any re­

sistance have been made to a fleet of active ships, fur­

nished with every kind of arms, by vessels loaded with

engines and machines, and which were either con­

verted to the purpose of transports, or pushed so close

to the walls, that they served instead of mounds and

bridges for the men to mount by 1 Scipio, therefore,

contrary to the usual practice in sea engagements,

where their strength however was superior, they spent

the whole day in approaching slowly, and about sunset

put into a harbor, which the Africans call Rnscino.

On the following day, about sunrise, they formed their

ships in a line towards the open sea, as if for a regular

sea fight, and as if the Romans were to come out to

meet them. When they had stood thus for a long
