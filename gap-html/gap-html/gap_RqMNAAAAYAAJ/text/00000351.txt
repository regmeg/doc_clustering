HISTORY OF ROME. BOOK XXXI. 335

despaired of his ever returning, he arrived in safety at

his camp. Two hundred Macedonian horsemen pe­

rished in that action; about one hundred were taken:

eighty horses, richly caparisoned, were led off the

field; at the same time the. spoils of arms were also

carried off.

of rashness on that day; and with the consul, as not

having pushed with spirit the advantage which he had

gained: for Philip, they say, on his part, ought to

have avoided coming to action, knowing that in a few

days the enemy, having exhausted all the adjacent

country, must be reduced to the extremity of want;

and that the consul, after having routed the Macedo­

nian cavalry and light infantry, and nearly taken the

king himself, ought to have led on his troops directly

to the enemy's camp, where, dismayed as they were,

they could have made no stand, and that he might

have finished the war in a moment's time. This, like

most other matters, was easier in speculation than in

practice: for if the king had brought his infantry into

the engagement, then, indeed, during the tumult, and

while, vanquished and struck with dismay, they fled

from the field into their intrenchments, (and even con­

tinued their flight from thence on seeing the victorious

enemy mounting the ramparts,) the king's camp might

have fallen into the Romans' possession. But as the

infantry had remained in the camp, fresh and free

from fatigue, with outposts before the gates, and guard

properly disposed, what would he have gained in hav­

ing imitated the rashness of which the king had just

now been guilty, by pursuing the routed horse? On

the other side, the king's first plan of an attack on the

foragers, while dispersed through the fields, was not

injudicious, could he have satisfied himself with a mo­

derate degree of success: and it is the less surprising

that he should have made a trial of fortune, as there

was a report that Pleuratus and the Dardanians had

marched with very numerous forces, and had already

passed into Macedonia; so that, if he should be sur­
