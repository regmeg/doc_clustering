HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK XXVII. 9

cus Lucretius, plebeian tribune, proposing the ques­

tion hereon, the senate decreed thus: 'That the con­

sul, before he left the city, should consult the people

as to whom they wished to be appointed dictator, and

should nominate to that office whomsoever they should

order. That if he refused this the pretor should hold

the meeting; and if he also were unwilling to do it,

that then the tribunes should propose the question.'

Valerius declared that he would not ask the judgment

of the people on a matter properly belonging to his

of the people, the dictator, Quintus Fulvius, named

Publius Licinius Crassus, then chief pontiff, master of

Sempronius lilassus, who had been a lieutenant-general

under him at Capua, into the province of Etruria, to

take the command of the army there, in the room of

the pretor, Caius Calpurnius, whom he called away by

letter, to command his own army at Capua. He ap­

pointed for the elections the earliest day on which

they could be held; but a dispute arising between the

dictator and the tribunes, they could not be finished

on that day. The younger Galerian century having

obtained by lot the privilege of voting first, named as

consuls Quintus Fulvius, and Quintus Fabius: and

the centuries, voting in their course, would have fol­

lowed them, had not two plebeian tribunes, Caius and
