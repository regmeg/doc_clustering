spoil which was landed from the ships, were inflamed

with a desire of passing over immediately; yet this

more important business was interrupted by one of

smaller consideration, the recovery of Locri; which,

at the time of the general defection of Italy, had re­

volted to the Carthaginians. The hope of accomplish­

ing this was kindled by a very trifling circumstance: the

operations in Bruttium were rather predatory excur­

were ransomed and sent back, they might be able to

put the citadel into their hands; telling them that they

had their residence in it, and were intirely trusted by

the Carthaginians. In consequence of this, the said

chiefs, who anxiously longed to return to Locri, in­

flamed at the same time with a desire of revenge, im­

first settled the plan for the execution of their project,

with the signals which were to be given and observed

between them at a distance. They then went them­

selves to Scipio, to Syracuse, where some of the exiles

were, and informing him of the promises made by the

prisoners, inspired probable hopes of success. On this

the consul despatched Marcus Sergius and Publius

Matienus, military tribunes, (the exiles accompanying
