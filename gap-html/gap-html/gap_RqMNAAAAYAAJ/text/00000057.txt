HISTORY OF ROME.'—BOOK XXVII. 41

that out of the two consular armies of the preceding

year, with a third, which was at Venusia, and had

been under the command of Marcellus, the consuls

were to choose whatever two they liked; and the third

was to be assigned to the commander, to whose lot the

proyince of Tarentum and Salentum should fall. The

other provinces were distributed in this manner: with

regard to the pretors, the city jurisdiction was assigned

to Publius Licinius Varus; the foreign, with such

other employment as the senate should direct, to Pub­

Publius Scipio and Marcus Silanus, their present pro­

vince of Spain, and the armies at present with them,

were decreed for the year. An order was sent to Sci­

pio that, out of eighty ships which he then had—some

Drought with' him from Italy, some taken at Carthage—>

he should send fifty over to Sardinia; because a report

prevailed that great naval preparations were going on

at Carthage, where the intention was to overspread the

whole coasts of Italy, Sicily, and Sardinia, with a fleet
