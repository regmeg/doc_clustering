HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK XXVII. 37

Scipio, asking him 'who, and of what country he was;

and why, at that early age, he had been found in a

camp V he told him that 'he was a Numidian, called

by his countrymen Massiva; that being left an orphan,

by the death of his father, he was educated in the fa­

Contenting himself therefore with sending some troops
