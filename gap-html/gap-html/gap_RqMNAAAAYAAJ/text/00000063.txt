rians of these intended measures, sent a party to lie in

ambush on the road from Tarentum. There, under the

hill of Petellia, three thousand horsemen and two

thousand foot were placed in concealment; and the

Romans marching carelessly, without having examined

the road, fell into the snare, where no less than two

thousand soldiers were killed, and about twelve hun­

Marcellus offered sacrifice on that day, and that on

the first victim being slain, the liver was found without

its head; in the second, all the usual parts appeared,

but there was a swelling observed on the head of the

liver; the aruspex also observing, that in the second
