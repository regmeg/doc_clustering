HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK XXVII. 15

by their antiquity, but on the customary practice of

more recent times; and that in the memory of their

fathers, and even grandfathers, no flamen of Jupiter

had been allowed it. The tribunes thought it reason­

able that, as the right had been suffered to fall into

disuse through the inattention of former flamens, the

injury ensuing should affect only themselves, and not

the office; and accordingly, without any opposition

from the pretor himself, and with the universal appro­

bation of the senate and commons, they introduced the

flamen to a seat in the senate, though all men were of

opinion that his having attained his object was owing

to the strict integrity of his conduct rather than to any

privilege of the priesthood. The consuls, before they

departed for their provinces, raised two city legions,

and such a number of soldiers as was necessary to

make up the complement of the other armies. The

force which hitherto had served in the city the consul

Fulvius gave to his brother Caius Fulvius Flaccus,

lieutenant-general, with orders to march it into Etruria,

and to bring home to Rome the legions then in that

province. The other consul, Fabius, having collected

the relics of Fulvius' army, which amounted to three

thousand three hundred and thirty-six men, ordered

his son Quintus Maximus to conduct them into Sicily,

to the proconsul Marcus Valerius, and to receive from

him the two legions and thirty quinqueremes. The re­

moval of these legions out of the island made no dimi­

nution, in respect either of strength or appearance, in

the force stationed in that province: for, besides two

veteran legions, completely recruited to their full com­

plement, the proconsul had a great multitude of Nu-

midian deserters, both horse and foot, and he also en­

listed in his service those Sicilians who had served in

the army of Epicydes, and that of the Carthaginians,

men well experienced in war. By annexing a part of

these foreign auxiliaries to each of the Roman legions,

he preserved the appearance of two armies; with one

of which he ordered Lucius Cincius to guard that part

of the island which was formerly the kingdom of Hiero;
