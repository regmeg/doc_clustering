HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK XXX. 285

money. That Publius Scipio had acted and was act­

ing properly and regularly, in treating as foes, and

throwing into confinement, those who were taken in

arms against the Roman people; and that Marcus Au-

relius did his duty to the state, and in a manner agree­

and Hanno, and made a proper use of occurrences as

they happened, they would have been in a condition of

prescribing terms, instead of begging a peace, as they

now did: but men were seldom blessed with good for­

tune and a good understanding at the same time.

That the Roman people were therefore invincible, be­

cause, when successful, they never lost sight of the

maxims of wisdom and prudence; and indeed, it

would have been surprising had they acted other­

wise: while those who are unaccustomed to success,

unable to restrain their transports, run into extrava­

gance. To the Roman people the joy of victory was

now habitual, and almost a matter of course; and they
