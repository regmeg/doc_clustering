this occasion, the two commanders displayed great

sagacity in their proceedings, while one endeavored to

effect, the other to guard against deception. Hanni­

bal had, with Marcellns' body, gotten possession of his

ring, and Crispinus, fearing lest mistakes occasioned

by means of this signet might give room to the Car­

thaginian for practising some of his wiles, sent ex­

presses round to all the neighboring states to inform

them that ' his colleague had been slain, that the enemy

was in possession of his ring, and that they should,

therefore, give no credit to any letters writlen in the

name of Marcellns.' This message from the consul

had but just arrived at Salapia, when a letter was

brought thither from Hannibal, written in the name of

Marcellns, intimating that ' he would come to Salapia

Salapians were aware of the fraud; and judging that

Hannibal, whom they had incensed, not only by their

and watches for that night with more than ordinary

care. On each side of the gate through which they

expected the enemy to come they placed the main

strength of the garrison. About the fourth watch

Hannibal approached the city: his vanguard was com­

posed of Roman deserters, armed also in the Roman

fashion. These, when they came to the gate, as they

all spoke the Latin language, called up the watch­

men, and ordered them to open the gate, for the consul

was at hand. The watchmen, as if awakened by their

call, were all in a hurry and bustle, striving to open

the gate which had been shut by letting down the port­

cullis: some raised this with levers, others pulled it
