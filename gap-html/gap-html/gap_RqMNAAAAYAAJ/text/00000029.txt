HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK XXVII. 13

Quintns Fabius those which Cains Calpurnius had

commanded in Etruria; the city troops were to re­

place those in Etruria, and Caius Calpurnius was to

command the same province, with the army; Titus

Quintius was to have the government of Capua, with

the army which had served there under Quintus Ful-

vius; Lucius Veturius was to receive from Caius Las-

torius, propretor, the province of Ariminum, with the

army then on the spot; to Marcus Marcellus were as­

signed the legions with which he had in his consulate

acted successfully; to Marcus Valerius, in conjunc­

tion with Lucius Cincius (for they also were continued

in command in Sicily), the troops of Cannae were

given, with orders to complete their full complement

out of the surviving soldiers of Cneius Fulvius' legions.

These were collected together, and sent by the consuls

into Sicily, being stigmatised by the same ignominious

order under which the troops of Cannae served, and

those of the army of the pretor Cneius Fulvius, whom

the senate, through resentment at the like cowardice,

had formerly ordered thither. To Caius Arunculeius

were assigned, for Sardinia, the same legions which

had served in that province under Publius Manlius

Vulso. Publius Sulpicius was continued in command

for a year, to hold the province of Macedonia, and with

the same legion and the same fleet which he then had.

Thirty quinqueremes were ordered to be sent from

Sicily to Tarentum, to Quintus Fabius the consul;

and, with the rest of the fleet, Marcus Valerius Laevi-

nus was either to sail over to Africa himself, to ravage

the country, or to send thither Lucius Cincius, or Mar­

cus Valerius Messala. With respect to Spain no change

was made, only that Scipio and Silanus were continued

in command, not for a year, but until they should be

recalled by the senate. Such was the distribution made

of the provinces, and of the commands of the armies

for that year.
