should be made from the fort at Eleusis on his men

employed in plundering, he might suddenly fall on the

enemy unawares, and while they were in disorder.

His stratagem did not escape discovery: wherefore,

calling back the soldiers, who had gone different ways

in pursuit of booty, and drawing them up in order, he

advanced to assault the fort at Eleusis; but being

repulsed from thence with many wounds, he joined

Philip on his return from Achaia, who was also in­

duced to a similar attempt: but the Roman ships

coming from Piraeus, and a body of forces being

thrown into the fort, he was compelled to relinquish

the design. On this the king, dividing bis army, sent

Philocles with one part to Athens, and went himself

with the other to Piraeus; that while his general, by

advancing to the walls and threatening an assault,

joins Piraeus to Athens, he laid aside the scheme of

attacking the city, and, dividing his forces again with

Philocles, set out to complete the devastation of the

country. As, in his former ravages, he had employed

himself in levelling the sepulchres round the city, so

now, not to leave any thing unviolated, he ordered the

temples of the gods, of which they had one conse­

The country of Attica afforded ample matter for the

exercise of this barbarous rage; for it was highly em­

bellished with works of that kind, having plenty of

marble, and abounding with artists of exquisite inge­

nuity. Nor was he satisfied with merely destroying

the temples themselves, and overthrowing the images,

but he ordered even the stones to be broken, lest,
