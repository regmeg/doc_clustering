HISTORY OF ROME.— BOOK XXIX. 223

The senate then received a survey of twelve colonies,

presented by the censors of those colonies, which had

never been done before, in order that records might

appear in the public archives of their proportion of

strength both in men and money. The review of the

knights then began; and it so happened that both the

censors had a horse at the public expense. When

they came to the Pollian tribe, in which was inrolled

the name of Marcus Livius, and whom the herald hesi­

tated to cite, Nero called to him, 'Cite Marcus Li­

vius;' and being actuated either by some remains of

their old enmity, or by an unseasonable affectation of

strictness, he ordered Livius to sell his horse, because

he had been condemned by a sentence of the people.

Narnian tribe, in which the name of his colleague ap­

two reasons: one, that he had given false evidence;

the other, that he had not been sincere in his recon­

treasury list, he gave in the name of his associate.

Marcus Livius also came thither, and except the Me-

tian tribe, which had neither concurred in his con­

demnation, nor in appointing him consul or censor,

he left the whole Roman people, thirty-four tribes, dis­

franchised in the treasury list; and this, he said, he

did, because they had not only condemned him when

innocent, but had elected him, while under the said

sentence, both consul and censor; so that they could

not deny that they had been guilty, either of one great

fault in giving their sentence, or of two in the elec­

tions. He added, that Caius Claudius would be in­

cluded in the list among the thirty-four tribes; but

that if there had been any precedent of inserting any
