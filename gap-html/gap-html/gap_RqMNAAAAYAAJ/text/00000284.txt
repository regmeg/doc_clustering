sovereignty, both by land and sea, over foreign realms.

I am far from denying that you have some reason to

distrust the faith of the Carthaginians, on account of

the insincerity which they showed in their solicitations,

and in not waiting the issue of the negotiation. Scipio,

the security of a peace being observed depends much

on the character of those who sue for it. Your senate,

I hear, refused to grant it, partly from the considera­

tion that the persons employed in the embassy were

not sufficiently respectable. Hannibal sues for peace,

who would not sue for it unless he thought it expedient;

and who on account of the same expediency which in­

because the war was begun by me, I took effectual

care, until the gods themselves declared against me,

that my countrymen should have no reason to com­

plain of it, so will I exert my utmost endeavors to

make them satisfied with a peace procured by any

means.'

trymen should understand how great a burden they

are relieved from by your means, so it is my bu­

siness to endeavor that they shall not now retract

the concessions which they then agreed to make, and

enjoy what they then ceded, as a reward of their

perfidy. Unworthy of being allowed the same terms,

you require additional advantages in consequence of

your treachery. Neither were our fathers the ag­

gressors in the war of Sicily, nor we in that of

Spain. In the former case the danger of their allies

the Mamertines; in the latter, the destruction of Sa-

guntum, armed us in the cause of justice and of duty.

That you were the aggressors, you yourself acknow­
