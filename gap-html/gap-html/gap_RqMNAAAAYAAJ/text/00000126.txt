ginian veterans and Africans, were still at such a dis­

tance, that they could not throw their javelins with

effect, nor did they dare to make detachments to the

wings, to support those who were engaged, for fear of

opening the centre to the forces advancing against it.

The Carthaginian wings were hard pressed, being at­

tacked on all sides; for the horse and foot, together

with the light infantry, wheeling round, fell in on their

flanks, while the cohorts pressed on them in front, in

order to separate the wings from the rest of the line.

the superiority which they had gained, redoubled the

fury of their assault on all sides, so that the shock

could hardly he sustained. Hasdrubal, however, en­

deavored to stop his men, crying out that ' the hills in

the rear would afford a safe refuge, if they would but
