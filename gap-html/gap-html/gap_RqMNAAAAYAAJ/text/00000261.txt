in a cup; to carry it to Sophonisba; and to tell her at

the same time that ' Masinissa would gladly have ful­

filled the first obligation which he owed her,—that due

from a husband to his wife; but that, since those who

had the power had not left that in his option, he now

magnificent than a triumph, and that those who were

so distinguished had not a more splendid dress than
