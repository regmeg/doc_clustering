to 3fou the province that you desire. I therefore call

on you, tribunes, to support me in refusing to give my

opinion, and for this reason, that, although a majority

should concur with me, yet the consul would appeal

from their judgment.' On this an altercation arose,

Scipio insisting that it was unfair for the tribunes to

interpose, so as to prevent any senator from giving his

opinion on being asked it in his place. The tribunes

determined thus: 'If the consul submits the regula­

that their decision shall be final, and we will not suffer

that matter to be carried before the people; if he does

not so submit it, we will support such as shall refuse

should judge it for the advantage of the state; to the

other, Bruttium, and the war against Hannibal, with

the army which Lucius Veturius, or that which Quin-

tus Caecilius commanded; that these latter should cast

lots, or settle between themselves, which of them

should command in Bruttium, with the two legions

which would be left by the consul; and that he, to

whose lot that province fell, should be continued in it

for another year. The others also who were to have

the charge of armies, besides the consuls and pretors,

had their commission prolonged. It fell by lot to

Quintus Cascilius, that, in conjunction with the consul,

he should manage the war against Hannibal in Brut*

tium. Scipio's games were then exhibited to a vast

concourse of spectators, who expressed the highest ap­

probation. Marcus Pomponius Matho and Quintus

Catius, being sent ambassadors to Delphi, with a pre­

sent out of the spoils of Hasdrubal, carried a golden

crown of two hundred pounds weight, and representa­

tions of the prizes, formed of one thousand pounds
