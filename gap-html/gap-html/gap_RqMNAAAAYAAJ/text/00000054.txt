very seasonable in another respect, as it gave him the

assistance of their counsel, respecting the measures to

be taken for the farther prosecution of the war. On

this occasion, when they compared accounts of the dis­

positions of the Spaniards in each of their several pro­

vinces, Hasdrubal, son of Gisgo, alone, made a favor­

able report; giving his opinion, that the remote track

of Spain, which lies on the ocean and about Gades,

was, as yet, unacquainted with the Romans, and there­

should be made up for Masinissa, to make excursions

through what they called Hither Spain, succor their

allies, and carry depredations through the towns and

lands of the enemy.' Having determined on these

measures, the commanders separated, to put their re­

solves in execution. Such were the transactions of

this year in Spain. At Rome, the reputation of Scipio
