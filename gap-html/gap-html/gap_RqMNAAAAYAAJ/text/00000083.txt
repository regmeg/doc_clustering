HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK XXVII. 67

therefore introduced a proposal of recalling the volun­

teer slaves to the standards. The senate gave the con­

suls unlimited power to fill up their companies with

himself, he would advance as far as he should think it

safe with his small force.' This letter obliged the con­

suls to finish the levies with haste, and to set out for

their respective provinces earlier than they had in­

his antagonist employed in his own province, so as not

to suffer the two to combine their forces into one body.

An opinion, formed by Hannibal, helped to farther their

design: for though he believed that his brother would

make good his way into Italy during the course of that

summer, yet, when he reflected on the difficulties with

which he had himself struggled, first in the passage of

the Rhone, then in that of the Alps, fighting against
