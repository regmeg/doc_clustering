ing, he began to fear, lest even the garrison might be

endangered, as it was not easy to retreat from it: he

therefore left the command at Messana to his brother,

Lucius Scipio, 'and going on board as soon as the tide

turned, he let his ships drive with the current. On the

other hand, Hannibal sent forward directions from the

river Aleces, which is not far from Locri, that his

party, at dawn of day, should attack the Romans and

Locrensians with their whole force; in order that,

while the attention of all should be turned to the

tumult occasioned thereby, he might make an unex­

thing proper for an assault, was coming up to the

walls, when on a sudden a gate flying open, the Romans

rushed out on him, when he apprehended nothing less

than such an encounter, and, as the attack was unex­

pected, two hundred of his men were slain. The rest

Hannibal carried back to the camp, as soon as he

understood that the consul was there in person; and
