cus Valerius Laevinus, then consuls, brought him back

into Rome; but still he appeared in a squalid dress,

and suffered his hair and beard to grow, displaying in

his countenance and garb a more than ordinary sensi­

bility of the censure passed on him, When Lucius

Veturius and Publius Licinius were censors, they

compelled him to be shaved, to lay aside his sordid

apparel, to attend the meetings of the senate, and per­

the patricians. One only person in the state, the per­

son to whom the honor was offered, objected to the

measure; charging the people with levity and incon­

stancy, he said, that 'when he appeared before them

in the situation of a defendant, in a mourning habit,

they refused him their compassion; yet now they
