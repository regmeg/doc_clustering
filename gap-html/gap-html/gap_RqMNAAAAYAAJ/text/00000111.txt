HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK XXVIII. 05

at Oreum, so easily obtained, proceeded with his vic­

torious fleet to Chalcis, where the issue by uo means

answered his expectations. The sea, from being pretty

wide at each side, is here contracted into a strait so

very narrow, that at first view the whole appears like

two harbors facing the two entrances of the Euripus.

A more dangerous station for a fleet can hardly be

found ; for besides that the winds rush down suddenly,

and with great fury, from the high mountains on each

side, the strait itself of the Euripus does not ebb and

flow seven times a day at stated hours, as report says;

but the current, changing irregularly, like the wind,

from one point to another, is hurried along like a tor­

rent tumbling from a steep mountain; so that, night or

day, ships can never lie quiet. But, besides the pe­

rilous situation iu which his fleet lay, he found that

the town was firm and impregnable; surrounded on

one side by the sea, extremely well fortified by land

on the other; secured by a strong garrison, and, above

all, by the fidelity of the commanders and principal

inhabitants; which character those at Oreum had not

supported with honor or steadiness. The Roman, in

a business rashly undertaken, acted so far prudently,

that, when he had seen all the difficulties attending it,

not to waste time, he quickly desisted from the at­

tempt, removing with his fleet from thence to Cynus in

Locris, the landing-place for the city of Opus, which

lies at the distance of a mile from the sea.

7. Philip had received notice from Oreum by the

signal fires; but, through the treachery of Plator, it

was too late when they were raised on the beacons,

and as he was not a match for the enemy at sea, it was

difficult for him to approach the island; he hesitated,

therefore, and took no part in that business. To the

relief of Chalcis he flew with alacrity, as soon as he

perceived the signal: for though Chalcis stands on

the same island, yet the strait which separates it from

the continent is so narrow, that there is a communi­

cation between them by a bridge, and the approach to

it is easier by land than by water. Philip, therefore,
