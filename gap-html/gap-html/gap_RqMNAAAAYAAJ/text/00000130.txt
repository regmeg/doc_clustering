these, and considering that the Romans were at that

time every where successful, the Carthaginians un­

fortunate in Italy, and quite excluded from Spain,

consented to embrace the friendship of the Romans,

but refused to exchange the ratification of the treaty

except with the Roman general in person. Lfelius

then returned to Scipio, having obtained from the king

an engagement merely of safe conduct for him. To

him, who aimed at conquests in Africa, the friendship

of Syphax was, in every respect, of the utmost im­

part of the world, had already opposed even the Car­

could not be accomplished. Leaving therefore, for the

security of Spain, Lucius Marcius at Tarraco, and

Marcus Silanus at New Carthage (to which place he

himself had made a hasty journey by land), and setting

sail from Carthage with Cains Liclius, in two galleys

and having cast anchor, was mooring his ships. On

sight of these two five-banked ships, although no one

doubted that they belonged to the Romans, and might

be overpowered by superior numbers before they en­

and confusion among the soldiers and sailors, endeavor­

ing to no purpose to get their arms and ships in readi­

ness; for the quinqueremes, having their sails filled

by a brisk gale from the sea, were carried into the

harbor before the Carthaginians could weigh their

anchors, and afterwards they dared not to raise a dis­

turbance in the king's port. Having landed, therefore,
