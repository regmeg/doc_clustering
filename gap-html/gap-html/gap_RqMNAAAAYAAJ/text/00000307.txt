HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK XXXI. 291

was quickly followed by a war with Macedonia: a war,

not to be compared with the former, indeed, either in

danger, or in the abilities of the commanders, or the

his engagements in the time of their distress, when

even the nearest allies of the Romans abandoned them;

and to request that, if they should be compelled by ill

treatment to break with Philip, he would preserve the

same disposition towards the Roman people. In Gaul,

about this time, the consul, Publius vElius, having
