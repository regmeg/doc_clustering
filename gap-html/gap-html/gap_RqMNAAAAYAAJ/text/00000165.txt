HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK XXVIII. 149

enemies in Spain, always separated the Saguntines

from the rest of the prisoners, and sent them home to

their own country; and lastly, by his arms, so hum­

bled Turdetania—a state so inveterate in its animosity

against us, that, if its power had continued, Saguntum

must have fallen,—that not only we, but (let me say it

without presumption) even our posterity, need have

no apprehensions from it. We now see their city de­

stroyed,—the city of a people for whose gratification

Hannibal ruined Saguntum. We now receive tribute

from their country—a circumstance not more gratify­

ing to us, in the profit we derive from it, than in the

satisfying of our revenge. In gratitude for these bless­

ings, greater than which we could not either hope or

implore from the immortal gods, the senate and people

of Saguntum have sent us their ten ambassadors to

present their thanks; and, at the same time, to con­

gratulate you on the success which has of late years

attended your arms in Spain and Italy. You hold the

possession of Spain, so acquired, not only as far as the

city of Iberus, but to the utmost limits and boundaries

by the ocean; while in Italy you have left nothing to

the Carthaginian but what the rampart of his camp

incloses. To Jove, supremely great and good, who

presides over the fortress of the capitol, we have been

ordered, not only to make acknowlegements for these

blessings, but, with your permission, to bear thither

this offering, a golden crown, in token of victory. We

request that you will permit us this act of reverence;

and also that you will ratify by your authority, and fix

on a permanent footing, the advantages bestowed on us

by your commanders.' The senate answered the Sa-

guntine ambassadors, that ' the destruction and resto­

ration of Saguntum would be an example to all na­

tions of social faith fulfilled on both sides; that their

commanders, in restoring that city, and delivering its

inhabitants from slavery, had acted properly, regu­

larly, and agreeably to the intentions of the senate:

that all other acts of kindness shown them had like­

wise their approbation; and that they gave them per-
