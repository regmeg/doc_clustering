When the others saw the horseman discharged in this

manner, with the approbation of the general, each be­

gan to excuse himself and receive a substitute. Thus

three hundred Sicilians, without any expense to the

public. The Sicilians had the trouble of instructing

and exercising them; the general having ordered, that

any who did not perform this should continue in the
