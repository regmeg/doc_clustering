after the destruction of Hasdrubal and his army, on

whom he had reposed all his hopes of victory, and

when he had given up the possession of all the rest of

Italy, and withdrawn into a corner of Bruttium, must

it not appear wonderful to all that no disturbance

arose in his camp? for there was this afflicting circum­

stance in addition to all his other difficulties, that he

had no hope of being able even to procure food for his

soldiers, except from the lands of Bruttium; which, if

they were intirely under tillage, were too small for the

support of so large an army. Besides, the war had

employed a great part of the young men, and carried

them away from the cultivation of the grounds; a base

practice likewise prevailing through the whole nation,

of making plundering excursions on every side; nor

were there any remittances made him from home,

where the whole attention of the public was engaged in

endeavoring to keep possession of Spain, as if affairs

in Italy were all in a state of prosperity. In the

than any other part of the world; and that was the

reason, that although tins was the first of all the pro­

vinces on the continent in which the Romans got foot­

the present age, under the conduct and auspices of

Augustus Caesar. In this country Hasdrubal, son of

Gisgo, a general of the greatest abilities and character

next to the Barcine family, returning now from Gades,

and being encouraged to a renewal of the war by Mago,

the son of Hamilcar, armed to the number of fifty

thousand foot, and four thousand five hundred horse,

by levies made in the Farther Spain. In the number

ef his cavalry authors are pretty well agreed; of the
