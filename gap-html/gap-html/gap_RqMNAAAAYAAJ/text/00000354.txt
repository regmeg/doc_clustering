Eordaea; then, having laid waste the whole country,

the consul withdrew into Elimea. From thence he

made an irruption into Orestis, and laid siege to the

city Celetrum, situated in a peninsula: a lake sur­

rounds the walls; and there is but one entrance from

the main land along a narrow isthmus. Relying on

their situation, the townsmen at first shut the gates,

and refused to submit; but afterwards, when they saw

the troops in motion, and advancing under cover of

their closed shields, and the isthmus, covered by the

enemy marching in, their courage failed them, and

the same who at Naupactum had persuaded them to

defer passing a decree concerning the war, had in the

next meeting roused them to arms, after hearing of the

battle between the cavalry at Octoloplms; the irrup­

tion of the Dardanians and of Pleuratus, with the Illy-

fleet, too, at Oreus; and that Macedonia, besides be-
