62 LIVY.

all men directed their attention to (he consuls elect,

and wished them, as speedily as possible, to cast lots

for their provinces, that each of them might know be­

forehand what province and what antagonist he was to

have. Measures were also taken in the senate, on a

motion made by Quintus Fabius Maximus, to recon­

cile them to each other; for there subsisted between

them an avowed enmity, which, on the side of Livms,

was the more inveterate, as, during his misfortunes,

he had felt himself treated with contempt by the other.

He was therefore the more obstinately implacable, and

insisted, that ' there was no need of any reconcilia­

tion: for they would conduct all business with the

greater diligence and activity, while each should be

afraid, lest a colleague, who was his enemy, might

find means of exalting his own character at the other's

expense.' Nevertheless, the influence of the senate

prevailed on them to lay aside their animosity, and

to act with harmony and unanimity in the administra­

tion of the government. The provinces allotted to

them were not, as in former years, a joint command in

the same districts, but quite separate, in the remotest

extremities of Italy: to one, Bruttium and Lucania,

where he was to act against Hannibal; to the other,

Gaul, where he was to oppose Hasdrubal, who was now

said to be approachingto the Alps. It was ordered that

the consul to whose lot Gaul fell should of the two

armies (one of which was in Gaul, and the other in

Etruria,) choose whichever he thought proper, and join

to it the city legions; and that he to whom the pro­

vince of Bruttium fell should, after enlisting new le­

gions for the city, take his choice of the armies com­

manded by the consuls of the preceding year; and

that the army left by the consul should be given to

Quintus Fulvius, proconsul, and that he should con­

tinue in command for the year. To Cains Hostilius,

to whom they had assigned the province of Tarentum,

in exchange for Etruria, they now gave Capua instead.

One legion was ordered for him,—that which Fulvius

had commanded the year before.
