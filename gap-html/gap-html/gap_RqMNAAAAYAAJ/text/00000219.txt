HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK XXIX. 203

also made of an affinity to be contracted between them,

by the king marrying Hasdrubal's daughter. Hasdru-

bal had gone with a design of completing this business,

and fixing a time for the nuptials, the damsel being

now marriageable; and finding him inflamed with

love (for the Nnmidians are, beyond all other barba­

rians, inclined to amorous pleasures), he sent for her

from Carthage, and hastened the wedding. Among

other instances of mutual regard and affection, and in

order that their private connexion might be cemented

by a public one, an alliance between the king and the

people of Carthage was ratified by oath, and their faith

reciprocally pledged that they would have the same

friends and enemies. But Hasdrubal remembered that

the king had previously entered into a league with

Scipio, and knowing how unsteady and changeable

were the minds of the barbarians, he dreaded lest, if

Scipio once came into Africa, that match might prove

a slender tie; he therefore seized the opportunity

while the warmth of the Numidian's new passion was

at the highest, and calling to his aid the blandishments

of his daughter, prevailed on him to send ambassadors

into Sicily to Scipio, and by them to warn him, 'not

to be induced, by a reliance on his former promises, to

pass over into Africa, for that he was now united to

the people of Carthage, both by his marriage with a

citizen of that state, daughter of Hasdrubal, whom he

had seen entertained in his house, and also by a public

treaty. He recommended it strongly to the Romans

to carry on the war against the Carthaginians, at a dis­

tance from Africa, as they had hitherto done, lest he

might be under a necessity of interfering in their

disputes, and of joining one or the other, while he

wished to decline taking part with either. If Scipio

should enter Africa, and advance his army towards

Carthage, he must then of necessity fight, as well in

defence of the country wherein he himself was born,

as in support of the native city of his spouse, her

parent, and household gods.'
