Africa; and with respect to the lands for his soldiers,

it was decreed that whatever number of years each of

them had served in Spain or in Africa, he should for

every year receive two acres; and that ten commis­

sioners should make the distribution. Three commis­

sioners were then appointed to fill up the number of

colonists at Venusia, because the strength of that co­

truth or falsehood of the pretor's narrative? He then

appointed a day for the elections, at which were chosen

consuls, Lucius Cornelius Lentulus and Publius Vil-

lius Tappulus. The pretors were then appointed, Lu­

cius Quintius Flamininus, Lucius Valerius Flaccus,
