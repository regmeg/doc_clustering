was inflamed with a strong desire of obtaining the pro­

vince of Africa; having in view either an easy con­

quest, or, if it were now to be concluded, the glory of

terminating so great a war in his consulate. He de­

clared, therefore, that he would not suffer any busi­

ness to be done until Africa were decreed to him; for

his colleague declined putting in his claim for it, being

a moderate, prudent man, who perceived that a contest

with Scipio for that honor, besides being unjust, would

be also unequal. Quintus Minucius Thermus and

Mauius Acilius Glabrio, tribunes of the people, said

that 'Cneius Cornelius was endeavoring to carry a

was to be conducted home, whom they would order to

do it. If they should order the peace to be granted

by Publius Scipio, and the army also to be brought

home by him, that then the consul should not cross

over from Sicily to Africa. That the other consul, to
