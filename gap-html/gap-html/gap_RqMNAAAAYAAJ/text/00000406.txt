was ordered to be sent into Macedonia to Quintius,

together with three thousand seamen. Lucius Quintius

Flamininus was continued in the command of the fleet.

To each of the pretors, for the two Spains, were

granted eight thousand foot, of the allies and Latines,

Cornelius took the direct road towards the Insubrians,

who were then in arms, and had been joined by the

Caenomanians. Quintus Minucius turned his route to

the left side of Italy, and leading away his army to
