able to restrain the effusions of their joy. They then

separated; some hastening to the temples of the gods

to return thanks, some to their own houses, to impart

the happy news to their wives and children. The se­

nate, in consideration of the consuls, Marcus Livius

and Cains Claudius, having cut off the general and the

legions of the enemy, decreed a supplication for three

days; which supplication the pretor, Cains Hostilius,

proclaimed in the assembly, and it was performed with

great devotion by all, both men and women. During

the whole three days, all the temples were equally

filled with crowds, whose numbers never diminished;

whilst the matrons, dressed in the most splendid man­

ner, and accompanied by their children, being now

delivered from every apprehension, just as if the war

were at an end, offered thanksgivings to the immortal

gods. This victory produced also a powerful effect on

the internal business of the state; insomuch, that peo­

ple immediately took courage to hold commerce with

each other as in time of peace, buying, selling, lend­

ing, and paying money due. The consul Claudius, on

returning to his camp, ordered the head of Hasdrubal,

which he had carefully kept and brought with him, to

be thrown before the advanced guards of the enemy;

and the African prisoners, chained as they were, to be

exposed to their view. Two of these he also unbound

and sent to Hannibal, with orders to inform him of

what had happened. We are told that Hannibal,

deeply struck by a disaster so fatal to his country, and

his house, said that he felt now the fortune of Car­

thage. He then decamped, and retired thence, de­

signing to draw together into Bruttium, the remotest

corner of Italy, all those confederates whom, while

scattered at wide distances, he could not protect; and

he removed from their own habitations, and carried

away into Bruttium, all the Metapontines, and such of

the Lucanians as acknowleged his authority.
