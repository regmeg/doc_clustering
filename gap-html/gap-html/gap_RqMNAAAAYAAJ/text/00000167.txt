HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK XXVIII. 161

and again, if it were, in my judgment it is the consul

who acts amiss; for it is a mockery of the senate to

pretend to consult them on a question if already de­

cided, and not the senator, who in his place would

speak to the business which he supposed in hand.

Now I am well aware, that, by disapproving this vio­

lent haste to pass over into Africa, I expose myself to

two impulations: one the caution natural to my tem­

per, which young men have my free consent to call

cowardice and sloth; while I have no reason to be

sorry that, although the schemes of others always car­

and who at the very time was endeavoring to injure

my character. I chose to effect my purpose by actions

rather than words; and that he who was set on a level

with me in the judgment of others should at length,

by his own confession, allow me a superiority over

him. Much less would I now, after having passed

through every dignity of the state, propose to myself

contests and emulations with a man blooming in youth.

Is it that Africa, if refused to him, might be decreed

as a province to me,—to me, already wearied, not only

with the toils of business, but even with length of
