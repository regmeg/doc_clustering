HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK XXXI. 327

rather than to trust to us,) yet, becoming masters of

the place, and by exertion of the same force setting it

at liberty, we restored it to the inhabitants. At the

same time, we do not deny that Sicily is our province,

and that the states which sided with the Carthaginians,

and, in conjunction with them, waged war against us,

pay us tribute and taxes; on the contrary, we wish

that you and all nations should know, that the condi­

tion of each is such as it has deserved at our hands:

and ought we to repent of the punishment inflicted on

the Campanians, of which even they themselves can­

not complain? These men, after we had on their ac­

count carried on war against the Samnites for near

seventy years, with great loss on our side; had united

them to ourselves, first by treaty, and then by inter­

marriages, and the consequent affinities; and lastly,

by admitting them to a participation of the rights of

our state, yet, in the time of our adversity, were the

first of all the states of Italy which revolted to Han­

nibal, after basely putting our garrison to death, and

afterwards, through resentment at being besieged by

us, sent Hannibal to attack Rome. If neither their

city nor one man of them had been left remaining, who

could take offence, or consider them as treated with

more severity than they had deserved? From con­

sciousness of guilt, greater numbers of them perished

by their own hands than by the punishments inflicted

by us. And while from the rest we took away the

town and the lands, still we left them a place to dwell

in, we suffered the city which partook not of the guilt

to stand uninjured; so that there is not visible this

day any trace of its having been besieged or taken.

But why do I speak of Capua, when even to van­

quished Carthage we granted peace and liberty? The

greatest danger is, that by our too great readiness to

pardon such, we may encourage others to try the for­

tune of war against us. Let so much suffice in our

defence, and against Philip, whose domestic crimes,

whose parricides and murders of his relations and

friends, and whose lust, more disgraceful to human
