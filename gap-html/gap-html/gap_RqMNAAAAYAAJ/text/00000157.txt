HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK XXVIII. 141

fatal frensy of the times, wherein, as it were, through

some pestilent contagion, not only the Illergetians and

Lacetanians, but even the Roman camp had been in­

fected: that the present state of himself, his brother,

and the rest of his countrymen, was such, that if it was

required they would surrender up to Scipio the life

which he had spared to them ; or, if they might be still

preserved, they would ever devote it to his service;

for in such case they should be actually twice indebted

enemies, but on those who carried arms. That he left

it to themselves, who had experienced both, to choose

the favor or the resentment of the Romans.' On these

terms Mandonius was dismissed, and they were only

fined a sum of money for the pay of the troops. Sci­

pio, having sent on his lieutenant into Farther Spain,
