HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK XXXI. 319

and the Lacedasmonians; and that he would not only

secure the lands of their allies from devastation, but

the territories of the Athenians, crossed the forest of

Cithaeron opposite to Eleusis. Despatching half of his

troops to make depredations in all parts of the coun­

try, he lay concealed with the remainder in a place

convenient for an ambush; in order that if any attack
