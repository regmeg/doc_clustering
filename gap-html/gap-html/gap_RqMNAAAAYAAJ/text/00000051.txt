them; while, on their side, not only the soldiers, but

a multitude of servants mixed among the troops, as­

sailed the enemy with stones, which they found every

where scattered, and which, in general, were of such

a size as that they could be thrown by the hand. But

though the ascent was difficult, and they were almost

overwhelmed with darts and stones, yet, through the

skill which they had acquired by practice in climbing

walls, and the obstinacy of their courage, the foremost

gained the summit. When they got on ground that

every quarter Scipio, who with his left wing had

charged the right of the enemy, continued the attack

with the greatest fury against their naked flank. And

now the Carthaginians had not even a passage open
