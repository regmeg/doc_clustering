HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK XXXI. 303

turn for great services performed by kings towards

them: that the Roman ambassadors would soon be in

Africa, to whom the senate would give instructions to

regulate conditions of peace with Vermina, as he should

submit the terms intirely to the will of the Roman

people; and that, if he wished that any thing should

be added, left out, or altered, he must make a second
