31. The Roman ambassador then addressed them to

this purport: 'The Macedonians first, and afterwards

the Athenians, have obliged me to change intirely the

method of my discourse: for, on the one hand, the

Macedonians, by introducing charges against the Ro­

and then, after making them give satisfaction to the

the Syracusans, when oppressed (and, to add to the

indignity, by foreign tyrants), we lent assistance; and

after enduring great fatigues in carrying on the

siege of so strong a city, both by land and sea, for

almost three years, (although the Syracusans them­
