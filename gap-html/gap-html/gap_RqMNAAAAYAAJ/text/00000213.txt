duct, he had lost, in Spain, nearly as many men by

mutiny as in war; that he both indulged the licen­

tiousness of the soldiers, and let his own passions

loose against them, in a manner customary only among

foreigners and kings.' To this speech he added a re­

against Scipio rising to a great degree of warmth; for,

besides the crime of Pieminius, and the calamities of

the Locrensians, the general's own manner of living

was represented as so far from being Roman, that it
