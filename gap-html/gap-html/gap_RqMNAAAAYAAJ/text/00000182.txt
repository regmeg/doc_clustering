166 LIVY.

mountaineers. His army increased daily, the Gauls,

induced by the greatness of his character, pouring in

from all sides. When the senate were informed of

these proceedings by letters from Spurius Lucretius,

they were filled with much anxiety, apprehending that

the joy which they had conceived on the destruction

of Hasdrubal and his army, two years before, would

prove ill-founded, if another war, equal to the former,

only under a different general, were to arise from the

same quarter. They therefore commanded Marcus

Livius, proconsul, to march an army of volunteer

slaves from Etruria to Ariminum, at the same time

charging the pretor, Cneins Servilius, if he judged it

advantageous to the state, to order the city legions to

be led into the field, by such commander as he should

think proper. Marcus Valerius Laevinus conducted

those legions to Arretium. About this time eighty

transport ships of the Carthaginians were taken on the

coast of Sardinia by Cneius Octavius, who held the

government of that province. Caalius relates that these

were laden with corn and provisions for Hannibal;

Valerius, that they were carrying to Carthage the

plunder of Etruria, and the Ligurian mountaineers,

who had been made prisoners. In Bruttium, hardly

any thing memorable happened during that year. A

pestilence had attacked both Romans and Carthagi­

nians with equal violence, except that the Carthagi­

nians, besides the disorder, were distressed by famine.

Hannibal spent the summer near the temple of Juno

Lacinea, where he built and dedicated an altar, with

an inscription in the Carthaginian and Greek charac­

ters, containing a pompous recital of his exploits.
