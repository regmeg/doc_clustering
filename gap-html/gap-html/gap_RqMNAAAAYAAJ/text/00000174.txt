equal with me; yet, from him I have no kind of

rivalry to apprehend; for he has attained to such a

height of eminence that he will not suffer me at any

time to be placed on a level with him, however anxi­

ously I may wish it; and that I do wish it, I will by

no means dissemble. He has, therefore, represented

himself as a man of gravity and wisdom, who has

when the public were at a loss for a general to conduct

that war, and no one stepped forward except myself;

when no one dared to declare himself a candidate;

when the Roman people had conferred the command

on me, though but twenty-four years old—how hap­

pened it that no mention was then made of my age, of

the power of the enemy, of the difficulties of opposing

him, or of the recent calamity of my relatives! Has
