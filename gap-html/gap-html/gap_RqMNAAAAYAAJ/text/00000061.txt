HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK XXVII. 45

The senate resolved, conformably to the opinion of

Manius Acilius, that the town should be secured by a

garrison, and all the Tareutines confined within the

walls, and that the business should be taken under

consideration at a future time, and when Italy should

be in a state of greater tranquillity. The case of Mar­

cus Livius, governor of the citadel of Tarentum, was

also debated with no less warmth: some advised to

pass a vote of censure on him, because that, in conse­

quence of his indolence, Tarentum had been betrayed

to the enemy; while others thought him deserving of

reward, for having defended the citadel for five years,

and for having, singly, been the principal cause of the

recovery of Tarentum. Moderate people affirmed

that the cognisance of his conduct belonged to the

censors, not to the senate; and of this opinion was

Fabius; nevertheless adding—' Livius was, no doubt,

the cause of Tarentum being recovered, as his friends

have so often boasted in the senate; but it should be

borne in mind that it could not have been recovered

if it had not been lost.' The consul, Titus Quintius

Crispinus, marched with a reinforcement into Lucania,

to join the army formerly commanded by Quintns

Fulvius Flaccus. Marcellus was detained by several

obstacles respecting religion, which occurred in quick

succession to disturb his mind: one of which was, that,

having in the battle with the Gauls at Clastidium

vowed a temple to Honor and Virtue, he had been

hindered by the pontiffs from dedicating it, for they

insisted that one shrine could not with propriety be

consecrated to more than one deity; because, if it

should be struck with lightning, or any kind of pro­

digy happen in it, the expiation would be difficult, as

it could not be determined to which of the deities sa­

crifice ought to be made; for one victim could not,

properly, be offered to two divinities, unless they were

known to be two to whom such victim must be accept­

able. Wherefore a separate temple was erected to

Virtue, and the work pushed forward with haste:

nevertheless these temples were not dedicated by him.
