world, the Roman and Carthaginian, had paid such

deference; that for the sake of procuring his friend­

ship, their own general, Scipio, leaving his province

and his army, sailed with only two quinqueremes to

Africa; and the Carthaginian general, Hasdrubal, not

only visited his kingdom, but also gave him his daughter

in marriage. That the Roman and Carthaginian gene­

rals had been within his grasp at one and the same

of private friendship and public leagues, and when he

received a Carthaginian wife into his house. By those

nuptial torches his palace had been set in flames; that

mischievous fury had, by every kind of allurement,

perverted his judgment, and led it astray; nor ever

desisted, until with her own hands she clad him in de­

testable arms against his guest and bis friend. Yet,

ruined and hopeless as he was, he felt some comfort in
