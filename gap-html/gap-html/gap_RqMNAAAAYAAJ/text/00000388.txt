space of a few days, taken these two important cities

of Eubeea, sailed round Sunium, a promontory of

Attica, and steered their course to Cenchrea, the

grand mart of the Corinthians. In the mean time the

consul found the siege of Atrax more tedious than he

had imagined, the enemy making an unexpected re足

sistance. He had supposed that the whole of the

trouble would be in demolishing the wall, and that if

he could once open a passage for his soldiers into the

city, the consequence would then be, the flight and

slaughter of the enemy, as usually happens on the

capture of towns. But when, on a breach being made

in the wall by the rams, and when the soldiers, by

mounting over the ruins, had entered the place, this

proved only the beginning, as it were, of an unusual

and fresh labor: for the Macedonians in garrison, who

were both chosen men and many in number, supposing

that they would be intitled to extraordinary honor if

they should maintain the defence of the city by means

of arms and courage, rather than by the help of walls,

formed themselves in a compact body, strengthening

their line by an uncommon number of files in depth.

These, when they saw the Romans entering by the

breaches, drove them back, so that they were en足

tangled among the rubbish, and with difficulty could

effect a retreat. This gave the consul great uneasi足

ness; for he considered such a disgrace, not merely as

it retarded the reduction of a single city, but as likely

to affect materially the whole process of the war, which

in general depends much on the influence of events in

themselves unimportant. Having therefore cleared

the ground about the half-ruined wall, he brought up

a tower of extraordinary height, consisting of many

stories, and which carried a great number of soldiers.

He likewise sent up the cohorts in strong bodies one

after another, to force their way if possible through

the wedge of the Macedonians, which is called a pha足

lanx. But in such a confined space (for the wall was

thrown down to no great extent), the enemy had the

advantage, both in the kind of weapons which they
