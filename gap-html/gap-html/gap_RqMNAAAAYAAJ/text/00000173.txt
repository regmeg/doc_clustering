HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK XXVIII. 157

yours resembles that of your father. He, in his con­

sulship, after having gone to Spain, came back from

his province to Italy, in order to meet Hannibal as he

was descending from the Alps: you, when Hannibal

is in Italy, intend to quit the country, not because you

judge that measure useful to the state, but because you

though I will not presume to bring a charge of such a

nature against so great a man, yet certainly, whether

through a defect in his discourse, or in the subject,

the suspicion has not been removed. For, in order to

avoid the imputation of envy, he has extolled his own

honors, and the fame of his exploits, in very magnifi­
