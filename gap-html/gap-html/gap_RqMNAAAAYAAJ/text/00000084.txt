men, and against the nature of the places, for five suc­

cessive months, he had not the least expectation that

the other would be able to effect his purpose with so

much more ease and expedition; and, for this reason,

he was the later in quitting his winter quarters. But

Hasdrubal found every thing to proceed more easily

and expeditiously than either himself or others had

even ventured to hope: for the Arvernians, and after­

wards the other Gallic and Alpine tribes, not only

gave him a friendly reception, but even accompanied

him to the war. Then, in most parts of the country

through which he marched, roads had been made by

his brother in places until then impassable; besides

which, as the Alps had, for twelve years, been a con­

of the inhabitants much improved: for in former times,

being never visited by foreigners, or accustomed to see

a stranger in their country, they were unsociable to­

the destination of the Carthaginian, they had imagined

that his object was their rocks and forts, and to make

prey of their men and cattle: but the accounts which

they heard of the Punic war, and by which Italy had

so long been harassed, by this time fully convinced

them that the Alps were only used as a passage, and

that two overgrown states, separated by vast tracks of

sea and land, were contending for power and empire.

These causes opened the Alps to Hasdrubal. But

whatever advantage he gained from the celerity of his

march, he lost it all by delaying at Placentia, where

he carried on a fruitless blockade, rather than an at­

tack. He had supposed that the reduction of a town,

standing in a plain, would be easily accomplished ; and

being a colony of great note, he was persuaded that,

by destroying this city, he should fill the rest with

terror. That siege, however, not only impeded his

own progress, but also stopped Hannibal, when he was

just setting out from his winter quarters, in conse­

quence of hearing that his brother had reached Italy

so much more quickly than he had expected: for he
