ON THE NATURE OF METALS.

BOOK XXXIII.

INTRODUCTION.

1. OF METALS.

I must now speak of metals, and of actual wealth, and of the

prices of things, what we diligently search after, in various ways,

within the earth. In some cases we dig for the purpose of obtain­

ing riches, searching, at the expense of our lives, for gold, silver,

electrum,1 and copper.* In some cases, for the purposes of

luxury, we search for gems, and for pigments, to adorn our walls

and our fingers; while in others, we rashly search for iron, which

for the purposes of war and slaughter is more acceptable even

than gold. We trace out all the veins of the earth, and live upon.

sionally yawn and tremble; as if all this could be dug out of our

sacred parent, without her expressing her anger. We descend

into her very bowels, and we search for treasures, even in the lower

tion of silver. The word Electrum is likewise used to signify amber, as in

book iii. sec. 30.

* By Ms is here probably meant copper; it is more fully described in the  
next book. We learn from the analysis of Klaproth, that the term Ms,

when applied to works of art—as cutting instruments, statues, vases, &c.

signified bronze, or a mixture of copper and tin, in which the proportion of

tin varied from a little more than 2 to 14 per cent, according as the object

was to procure a flexible or a hard substance: Nicholson's Journal, xxvi. 90,

et seq. and Aikiu's Diet. "Copper," i. 348. Watson has rendered it pro­

bable, that brass, the mixture of copper and zinc, was called by the ancients

Orichalcum: Manchester Trans, ii. 47, et seq. Agricola speaks of Ms as

synonimous with Cuprum: De Vet. & Nov. Met. lib. i. p. 391. He also

remarks, "Ms autem cadmia tingitur, et abit in aureum colorem, appella-

turque a Grsecis optixaXicov." De Nat. Foss. lib. viii. p. 337.
