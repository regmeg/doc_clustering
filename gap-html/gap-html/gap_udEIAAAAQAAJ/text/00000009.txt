THE

NATURAL HISTORY OF PLINY.

BOOK I.

DEDICATION.

C. PLINIUS SECUNDUS TO HIS FRIEND TIT0S VESPASIAN.

This treatise on Natural History, a novel work in Roman

literature, which I have just completed, I have determined to

dedicate, in a diffuse epistle, to you most pleasant1 emperor, (an

appellation peculiarly suitable to you, while, on account of his

age, it is less appropriate to your illustrious father,)

"For still thou ne'er would'st quite despise

The trifles that I write

if I may be allowed to quote the words of Catullus, my fellow-

countryman, 3 a military term, which you well understand. For

he, as you know, by altering the old words, * made himself some-

1 "Jucundissime;" it is not easy to find an epithet in our language

which will cerrectly express the meaning of the original, at the same time

that it is sufficiently dignified and respectful.

â€¢ Lamb's trans,; Carm. i. 1. 4. of the original.

3 "Conterraneus;" we have no word in English which expresses the idea

intended by the original, and which is, at the same time, a military term.

There is indeed some reason to doubt whether the word now inserted in

the text was the one employed by the author: see note in Valpy, p. 174;

also an observation in Cigalino's dissertation on the native country of Pliny;

in Valpy, p. 8.

* "Permutatis prioribus seetabis ;" it appears that what were commonly  
called sudaria, napkins, Catullus calls sudaria Saetaba, Ssetabian napkins,

Carm. xii. 14; xxv. 7, probably from their having been made at Saetabis;

the individuals mentioned in the text, who, as Catullus informs us, gave

him the napkins, had visited Sfctabis in a military capacity: see Lamb's

Catullus, p. 135 and 149.
