PREFACE.

The Natural History of Pliny has been always

regarded as one of the most precious remains of anti足

quity. I conceive, therefore, that it will be unnecessary

for me to make any observations, either on the value of

the original, or on the addition that our literature would

receive from a correct translation of it. It may be suffi足

cient to remark, that it will enable us to learn the state

both of the sciences and of the arts among the Romans,

and to ascertain the progress which they had made in

the knowledge of nature.

My object in the proposed work is to present the

English reader with a faithful translation, and to give it,

as much as possible, in the style of the original. That

this is an undertaking of some difficulty every one will

admit, who is acquainted with the variety of topics on

which the author treats, and with the mode in which he

conveys his information. Partly owing to the imperfect

state of the manuscripts, and partly depending on the

nature of the subject, we are frequently at a loss to

develope the meaning of the author, and where we have

not this obstacle to contend against, it is often difficult to

transfer the meaning into our language, without destroy足

ing the air of the original.

With respect to notes and illustrations, it is not easy

for a translator to prescribe to himself the correct method

which he ought to pursue. Without some assistance of

this kind, the text would be often unintelligible; and yet

to give all that might be appended in the way of com足

mentary would lead to an endless accumulation of matter.
