GOLD CROWNS. 27

9. HOW FREQUENTLY THE APPELLATION OF THE KNIGHTS

WAS CHANGED.

The appellation of the knights has been frequently changed,

even with respect to those who have been admitted into the order.

Under Romulus and the kings, they were called Celeres, then

Flexumines, and afterwards Trossuli, because, without any as足

sistance from the infantry, they took a town of that name in

Tuscany, which was nine miles on this side of the Volcinii: this

name remained until after the time of C. Gracchus. Junius, in足

deed, who, on account of his friendship with Gracchus, was called

Gracchanus, has left these words in writing: " as for what belongs

to the equestrian order, they were formerly named Trossuli, and

are now called Equites, (knights) because they are not acquainted

with the meaning of the name, and many of them are ashamed

to be called Trussuli."3

10. OF MILITARY DONATIONS IN BOTH GOLD AND SILVER.

There are some other distinctions in the use of gold which must

not be omitted. Allies and foreigners were presented with gold

chains, while citizens had only silver ones; and besides, bracelets

were given to citizens, which was not done to foreigners.

11. WHEN THE FIRST GOLD CROWN WAS PRESENTED.

Crowns of gold were likewise given to the citizens, a circum足

stance which is more remarkable. I have not been able to learn

who it was that first received one of them. We are however told

by L. Piso, that it was first presented by A. Posthumius, the

dictator, upon the capture of the camp of the Latins, at the Lake

Regillus; he gave, out of the plunder, the crown in question to

an individual who had particularly signalized himself on the occa足

sion. The consul L. Lentulus likewise gave one of 5 lbs. weight

to Serg. Corn. Merenda, on taking the town of the Samnites. Piso,

surnamed the Thrifty, presented his son with a crown, out of his

own property, and he left it to him by an especial bequest.
