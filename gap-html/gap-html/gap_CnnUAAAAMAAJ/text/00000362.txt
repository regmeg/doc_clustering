356 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS. Book XV.

as if they took no notice of Herod, who, upon the change he had

made in their government, introduced such customs, and that

in a violent manner, which they had never been used to before;

as indeed in pretence a king, but in reality one that showed

himself an enemy to their whole nation; on which account ten

men that were citizens [of Jerusalem,] conspired together

against him, and swore to one another to undergo any dangers in

the attempt, and took daggers with them under their garments,

[for the purpose of killing Herod.] Now there was a certain

blind man among those conspirators, who had thus sworn to one

another, on account of the indignation he had against what he

heard to have been done; he was not indeed able to afford the

rest any assistance in the undertaking, but was ready to un­

dergo any suffering with them, if so be they should come to any

harm, insomuch, that he became a very great encourager of the

rest of the undertakers.

4. When they had taken this resolution, and that by common

consent, they went into the theatre, hoping that, in the first place,

Herod himself could not escape them, as they should fall upon

him so unexpectedly; and supposing, however, that if they mis­

sed him, they should kill a great many of those that were about

him; and this resolution they took, though they should die for

it, in order to suggest to the king, what injuries he had done to

the multitude. These conspirators, therefore, standing thus pre­

pared beforehand, went about their design with great alacrity;

but there was one of those spies of Herod's that were appointed

for such purposes, to fish out and inform him of any conspiracies

that should be made against him, who found out the whole affair,

and told the king of it, as he was about to go into the theatre.

So when he reflected on the hatred which he knew the greatest

part of the people bore him, and on the disturbances that arose

upon every occasion, he thought this plot against him not to

be improbable. Accordingly, he retired into his palace, and call­

ed those that were accused of this conspiracy before him by

their several names; and as, upon the guards' falling upon them,

they were caught in the very fact, and knew they could not es

cape, they prepared themselves for their ends with all the de­

cency they could, and so as not at all to recede from their re­

solute behaviour; for they showed no shame for what they were

about, nor denied it, but when they were seized, they showed

their daggers, and professed, that "the conspiracy they had

"sworn to was a holy and a pious action; that what they in-

"tended to do was not for gain, or out of any indulgence to

"their passions, but principally for those common customs of

"their country, which all the Jews were obliged to observe, or

"to die for them." This was what these men said, out of their
