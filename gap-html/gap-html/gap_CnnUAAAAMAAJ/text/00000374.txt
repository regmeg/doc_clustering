upon him a revenue of a hundred talents out of his own king­

dom, that in case he came to any harm himself, his brother might

be in safety, and that his sons might not have dominion over him.

So when he had conducted Caesar to the sea, and was returned

home, he built him a most beautiful temple of the whitest stone,

in Zenodorus' country, near the place called Panium. This is

a very fine cave in a mountain, under which there is a great ca­

vity in the earth, and the cavern is abrupt, and prodigiously deep,

and full of a still water; over it hangs a vast mountain; and un­

der the caverns arise the springs of the river Jordan. Herod

adorned this place, which was already a very remarkable one,

still farther, by the erection of this temple, which he dedicated

to Caesar.

of their taxes, under pretence indeed of relieving them, after the

dearth they had had; but the main reason was, to recover their

good-will, which he now wanted, for they were uneasy at him,

because of the innovations he had introduced in their practices, of

to the citadel Hyrcania,both openly and secretly, and were there

put to death; and there were spies set every where, both in the

city, and in the roads, who watched those that met together; nay,

it is reported, that he did not himself neglect this part of caution,

but that he would oftentimes himself take the habit of a private

man, and mix among the multitude, in the night time, and make

trial what opinion they had of his government; and as for those

that could no way be reduced to acquiesce under his scheme of

government, he prosecuted them all manner of ways, but for the

rest of the multitude, he required that they should be obliged to

take an oath of fidelity to him, and at the same time compelled

them to swear that they would bear him good-will, and con­

tinue certainly so to do, in his management of the government;

and indeed a great part of them, either to please him, or out of
