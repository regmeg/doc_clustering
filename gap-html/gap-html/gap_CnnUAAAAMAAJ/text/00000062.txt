the scribe, and Joash the recorder, and Eliakim the high priest,

curators of the temple, and of the charges contributed thereto.

'who made no delay, nor put off the work at all, but prepar­

ed architects, and whatsoever was proper for those repairs, and

set closely about the work. So the temple was repaired by

this means, and became a public demonstration of the king's

piety.

2. But when he was now in the eighteenth year of his reign,

he sent to Eliakim the high priest, and gave order, that out of

what money was overplus, he should cast cups and dishes, and

vials, for ministration [in the temple]; and besides, that they

should bring all the gold and silver which was among the trea­

sures, and expend that also in making cups and the like vessels:

But as tie high priest was bringing out the gold, he light upon

the holy books of Moses that were laid up hi the temple, and
