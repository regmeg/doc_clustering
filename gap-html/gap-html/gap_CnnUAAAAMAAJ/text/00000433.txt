Chap. XI . ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS. 427

attempt to kill his own sons who were of very comely bodies,

and the great darlings of other men, and no way deficient in

their conduct, whether it were in hunting, or in warlike exer­

cises, or in speaking upon occasional topics of discourse: for in

all these they were skilful, and especially Alexander, who was

the eldest; for certainly it had been sufficient, even though he

had condemned them, to have kept them alive in bonds, or to

let them live at a distance from his dominions in banishment,

while he was surrounded by the Roman forces, which were a

strong security to him, whose help would'prevent his suffering

any thing by a sudden onset, or by open force; but for him to

kill them on the sudden, in order to gratify a passion that go­

verned him, was a demonstration of insufferable impiety; he also

was guilty of so great a crime in his older age; nor will the

delays that he made, and the length of time in which the

thing was done, plead at all for his excuse; for when a man

is on a sudden amazed, and in commotion of mind, and then

commits a wicked action, although this be a heavy crime, yet

is it a thing that frequently happens; but to do it upon deliber­

ation, and after frequent attempts, and as frequent puttings off)

to undertake it at last, and accomplish it, was the action of a

murderous mind, and such as was not easily moved from that

which is evil: And this temper he showed in what he did af­

terward, when he did not spare those that seemed to be the

best beloved of his friends that were left, wherein though the

justice of the punishment caused those that perished to be the

less pitied, yet was the barbarity of the man here equal, in that

he did not abstain from their slaughter also; but of those per­

sons we shall have occasion to discourse more hereafter.
