83 ,' ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS. Book X.

"spoil the temple, and forbid the sacrifices to be offered for

"three years' time." And indeed so it came to pass, that our

nation suffered these things under Antiochus Epiphanes, ac­

cording to Daniel's vision, and what he wrote many years be­

fore they came to pass. In the very same manner Daniel also

wrote concerning the Roman government, and that our country

should be made desolate by them. Ah1 these things did this

man leave in writing, as God had showed them to him, inso­

much, that such as read his prophecies, and see how they have

been fulfilled, would wonder at the honour wherewith God hon­

oured Daniel: and may thence discover how the Epicureans are in

an error, who cast providence out of human life, and do not be­

lieve that God takes care of the affairs of the world, nor that.the

universe is governed and continued in being by that blessed and

immortal nature, but say that the world is carried along of its

own accord, without a ruler and a curator: which, were it des­

titute of a guide to conduct it, as they imagine, it would be

like ships without pilots, which we see drowned by the winds,

or like chariots -without drivers, which are overturned, so would

the world be dashed in pieces by its being carried without a

Providence, and so perish, and come to nought. So that, by

the forementioned predictions of Daniel, those men seem to

me very much to err from the truth, who determine, that God

exercises no providence over human affairs: for if that were

the case, that the world went on by mechanical necessity, we

should not see that all things would come to pass according to

his prophecy. Now as to myself, I have so described these

matters as I have found them and read them; but if any one

is inclined to' another opinion about them, let him enjoy his

different sentiments without any blame from me.
