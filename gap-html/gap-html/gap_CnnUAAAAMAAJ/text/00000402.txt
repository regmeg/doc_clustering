396 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS. Book XVI.

at Actium: and for the Antiochians, the inhabitants of the

principal city in Syria, where a broad street cuts through the

place lengthways, he built cloisters along it on both sides; and

laid the open road- with polished stone, and was of very great

advantage to the inhabitants. And as to the Olympic games,

which were in a very low condition, by reason of the failure of

their revenues, he recovered their reputation, and appointed re­

venues, for their maintenance, and made that solemn meeting

more venerable, as to the sacrifices and other ornaments: and

by reason of this vast liberality, he was generally declared in

their inscriptions to be one of the perpetual managers of those

games.

4. Now some there are who stand amazed at the diversity of

Herod's nature and purposes; for when we have respect to his

magnificence, and the benefits which he bestowed on all mankind,

there is no possibility for even those that had the least respect for

him, to deny, or not openly to confess, that he had a nature vastly

beneficent; but when any one looks upon the punishments he

inflicted, and the injuries he did, not only to his subjects, but to

his nearest relations, and takes notice of his severe and unrelent­

ing disposition there, he will be forced to allow, that it was brut­

ish, and a stranger to all humanity, insomuch that these men

suppose his nature to be different, and sometimes at contradic­

tion with itself: but 1 am myself of another opinion, and ima­

the same: for being a man ambitious of honour, and quite over­

come by that passion, he was induced to be magnificent, where-

ever there appeared any hopes of a future memorial, or of re­

putation at present; and as his expenses were beyond his abili­

ties, he was necessitated to be harsh to his subjects; for the per­

sons on whom he expended his money were so many, that they

made him a very bad procurer of it: and because he was con­

scious that he was hated by those under him, for the injuries he

did them, he thought it not an easy thing to amend his offences,

for that it was convenient for his revenue, he therefore strove

on the other side to make their ill-will an occasion of his gains.

As to his own court, therefore, if any one was not very obsequious

to him in his language, and would not confess himself to be his

slave, or but seemed to think of any innovation in his govern­

ment, he was not able to contain himself, but prosecuted his very

kindred and friends, and punished them as if they were ene­

mies; and this wickedness he undertook out of a desire that he

might be himself alone honoured. Now for this my assertion

about that passion of his, we have the greatest evidence, by what

he did to honour Caesar and Agrippa, and his other friends ; for

with what honours he paid his respects to them who were his
