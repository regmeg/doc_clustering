16. The declaration of Lucius Lentullus the consul: "I have

* dismissed those Jews who are Roman citizens, and who ap-

* pear to me to have their religious rites, and to observe the  
"laws of the Jews at Ephesus, on account of the superstition

"they are under. This act was done before the thirteenth of

"the calends of October."

17. "Lucius Antonius, the son of Marcus, vice-questor, and

"vice-pretor, to the magistrates, senate, and people of the

"Sardians, sendeth greeting: those Jews that are our fellow-

"citizens of Rome, came to me, and demonstrated that they

"had an assembly of their own, according to the laws of their

"forefathers, and this from the beginning, as also a place of

"their own, wherein they determined their suits and controver-

"sies with one another: Upon their petition therefore to me,

"that these might be lawful for them, I gave order that these

"their privileges be preserved, and they be permitted to do

"accordingly."

18. The declaration of Marcus Publius, the son of Spurius,

"Dositheus, the son of Cleopatrida of Alexandria desired, that,

"if he thought good, he would dismiss those Jews who were

"Roman citizens, and were wont to observe the rites of the

"Jewish religion, on account of the superstition they were un-

"der. Accordingly, he did dismiss them. This was done be-

"fore the thirteenth of the calends of October."
