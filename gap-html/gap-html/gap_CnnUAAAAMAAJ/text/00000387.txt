Chap. II. ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS. 381

* who have been the donors, will take care that those favours  
"you have already granted them may not be taken away from

"them. We have received these favours from you, who

"alone have power to grant them, but have them taken from

"us by such as are no greater than ourselves, and by such as

"we know are as much subjects as we are: and certainly, if

"we have been vouchsafed great favours, it is to our own com-

"mendation, who have obtained them, as having been found

"deserving of such great favours; and if those favours be but

"small ones, it would be barbarous for the donors not to con-

"firm them to us; and for those that are the hinderance of the

"Jews, and use them reproachfully, it is evident that they af-

"front both the receivers, while they will not allow those

"to be worthy men to whom their excellent rulers themselves

"have borne their testimony, and the donors while they desire

"those favours already granted may be abrogated. Now if

"any one should ask these Gentiles themselves, which of the

"two things they would choose to part with, their lives, or

"the customs of their forefathers, their solemnities, their sa-

"orifices, their festivals, which they celebrated in honour of

"those they suppose to be gods? I know very well that they

"would choose to suffer any thing whatsoever, rather than a

"dissolution of any of the customs of their forefathers; for a

"great many of them have rather chosen to go to war on that

"account, as very solicitous not to transgress in those matters:

"And indeed we take an estimate of that happiness which all

"mankind do now enjoy by your means from this very thing,

"that we are allowed every one to worship as our own institu-

"tions require, and yet to live [in peace,] and although they

"would not be thus treated themselves, yet do they endeavour

"to compel others to comply with them, as if it were not as

"great an instance of impiety, profanely to dissolve the reli-

"gious solemnities of any others, as to be negligent in the obser-

"vation of their own tov?ards their gods. And let us now con-

"sider the one of these practices: Is there any people or city,

"or community of men, to whom your government and the

*' Reman power does not appear to be the greatest blessing? Is  
"there any one that can desire to make void the favours they

"have granted? No one is certainly so mad: for there are no

"men but such as have been partakers of their favours, both

-' public and private; and indeed those that take away what  
'- you have granted, can have no assurance; but every one of

"their own grants made them by you, may be taken from them

"also; which grants of yours can yet never be sufficiently

"valued; for if they consider the old governments, under kings,
