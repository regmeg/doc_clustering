76 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS. Book X.

given a command, that all the wise men should be put to death,

and that among them himself and his three kinsmen were in dan­

ger, he went to Arioch, who was captain of the king's guards,

and desired to know of him what was the reason why the king

had given command that all the wise men, and Chaldeans, and

magicians, should be slain; So when he had learned that the

king had had a dream, and had forgotten it, and that when they

were enjoined to inferm the king of it, they had said they could

not do it, and had thereby provoked him to anger; he desired of

Arioch that he would go in to the king, and desire respite for the

magicians for one night, and to put off their slaughter so long,

for that he hoped within that time to obtain, by prayer to God,

the knowledge of the dream. Accordingly, Arioeh informed

the king of what Daniel desired: So the kmg bid them delay the

slaughter of the magicians till he knew what Daniel's promise-

would come to-; but the young man retired to his own house,

with his kinsmen,- and besought God that whole night to dis­

cover the dream, and thereby deliver the magicians and Chal­

deans, with whom they were themselves- to perish, from the

king's anger, by enabling him to declare his vision, and to make

manifest what the king had seen the night before in his sleep,-

but had forgotten it. Accordingly, God out of pity to those that

were in danger, and out of regard to the wisdom of Daniel, made

known to him the dream and its_ interpretation, that so the king

might understand by him its signification also. When Daniel had

obtamed this knowledge from God, he arose very joyful, and told

it his brethren, and made them glad, and to hope well, that

they should now preserve their Eves, of which they despaired

before; and had their minds full of nothing but the thoughts

of dying. So when he had with them returned thanks to God

who had commiserated their youth, when it was day he came

to Arioch, and desired him to bring him to the king, because

he would discover to him that dream which he had seen the

night before.

4. When Daniel was come in to the king, he excused himsel

first, that "he did not pretend to be wiser than the other Chal

"deans and magicians, when, upon their entire inability to dis-

"cover his dream, he was undertaking to inform him of it, for

"this was not by his own skill, or on account of his having befr-

"ter cultivated his understanding than the rest, but he said, God

"hath had pity upon us, when we were in danger of death, and

"when I prayed for the life of myself, and of those of my own

"nation, hath made manifest to me both the dream, and the in-

"terpretation thereof, for I was not less concerned for thy glory

"than for the sorrow that we were by thee condemned to die,
