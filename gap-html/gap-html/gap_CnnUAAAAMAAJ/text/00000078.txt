country with presents to Gedaliah, none of them knowing what

had befallen him; when Ishmael saw them, he invited them in

to Gedaliah, and when they were come in, he shut up the court,

and slew them, and cast their dead bodies down into a certain deep

pit, that they might not be seen; but of these fourscore men

'Ishmael spared those that entreated him not to kill them; till they

had delivered up to him what riches they had concealed in the

fields, consisting of their furniture, and garments, and corn: but

he took captive the people that were in Mispah, with their

wives and children; among whom were the daughters of king

Zedekiah, whom Nebuzaradan, the general of the army of Ba足

bylon, had left with Gedaliah: And when he had done this, he

came to the king of the Ammonites.

5. But when Johanan and the rulers with him heard of what

'was done at Mispah by Ishmael, and of the death of Gedaliah,

they had indignation at it, and every one of them took his own

armed men and came suddenly to fight with Ishmael, and over足

took him at the fountain in Hebron: And when those that were

remove from thence, and go into Egypt, out of fear lest the

Babylonians should slay them in case they continued in the

country, and that out of anger at the slaughter of Gedaliah,

who had been by them set over it for governor.

6. Now while they were under this deliberation, Johanan, the

son of Kareah, and the riders that were with him, came to Je足

remiah the prophet, and desired that he would pray to God that

because they were at an utter loss about what they ought to do,

he would discover it to them, and they sware that they would do

whatsoever Jeremiah should say to them. And when the pro足

phet said he would be their intercessor with God, it'came to pass,

that after ten days God appeared to him, and said, "That he

"would inform Johanan and the other rulers, and all the people,

"that he would be with them while they continued in that coun-

"try, and take care of them, and keep them from being hurt

"would desert them, if they went into Egypt, and out of his

"wrath against them, would inflict the same punishments upon

"them which they knew their brethren had already endured."
