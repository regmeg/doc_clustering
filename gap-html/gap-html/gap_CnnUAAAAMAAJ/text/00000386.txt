380 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS. Book XVI.

in troubles because of his kindness, and in prosperity because of

the respect Agrippa had for him. Now as soon as those affairs of

Pontus were finished, for whose sake Agrippa was sent thither,

they did not think fit to return by sea, but passed through

Paphlagonia and Cappadocia; they then travelled thence over

great Phrygia, and came to Ephesus, and then they sailed from

Ephesus to Samos. And indeed the king bestowed a great many

benefits on every city that he came to, according as they

stood in need of them; for as for those that wanted either

money or kind treatment, he was not wanting to them; but he

supplied the former himself out of his own expenses:' he also

became an intercessor with Agrippa for all such as sought after

his favour, and he brought things so about, that the petitioners

failed in none of their suits to him, Agrippa being himself of a

good disposition, and of great generosity, and ready to grant all

such requests as might be advantageous to the petitioners, pro­

vided they were not to the detriment of others. The inclination

of the king was of great weight also, and still excited Agrippa,

who was himself ready to do good; for he made a reconciliation

between the people of Ilium, at whom he was angry, and paid

what money the people of Chios owed Caesar's procurators, and

discharged them of their tributes; and helped all others accord­

multitude of Jews, who dwelt in their cities, came to them, and

laying liold of the opportunity and the liberty now given them,

laid before them the injuries which they suffered, while they

were not permitted to use their own laws, but were compelled

to prosecute theif lawsuits by the ill usage of the judges, upon

their holy-days, and were deprived of the money they used to

lay up at Jerusalem, and were forced into the army, and upon

such other offices as obliged them to spend their sacred money:

from which burdens they always used to be freed by the Ro­

mans, who had still permitted them to live according to their

own laws. When this clamour was made, the king desired of

Agrippa that he would hear their cause, and assigned Nicolaus,

one of his friends, to plead for those, their privileges. Accord­

ingly, when Agrippa had called the principal of the Romans,

and such of the kings and rulers as we-re there, to be his asses­

sors, Nicolaus stood up, and pleaded for the Jews, as follows:

"It is of necessity incumbent on such as are in distress to have

"recourse to those that have it in their power to free them

"from those injuries they lie under; and for those that now are

"complainants, they approach you with great assurance; for as

"they have formerly often obtained your favour, so far as they

"have even wished to have it, they now only entreat that you,
