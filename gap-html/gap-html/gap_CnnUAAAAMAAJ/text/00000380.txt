374" ANTIQUITIES OF THE JBWS. Book XV.

asked for, ajid obtained, the power over them from the emperor,

who gave command to Vitellius, who was then commander in

Syria, to give it them accordingly. Before that time, they were

kept under the seal of the high priest, and of the treasurers of

the temple; which treasurers, the day before a festival, went

up to the Roman captain of the temple guards, and viewed

their own seal, and received the vestments; and again, when

the festival was over, they brought them to the same place, and

showed the captain of the temple guards their seal, which cor­

responded with his seal, and reposited them there. And that

these things were so, the afflictions that happened to us after­

ward [about them] are sufficient evidence: But for the tgvyer

itself, when Herod the king of the Jews had fortified it more

firmly than before, in order to secure and guard the temple, he

gratified Antonius, who was his friend, and the Roman ruler,

and then gave it the name of the Tower pf Antonia.

ple there were four gates; the first led to the king's palace,

and went (o a passage over the intermediate valley; two more

led to the suburbs of the city; and the last led to the other

city, where the roqd descended down info the valley by a great

number of steps, and thence up again by the ascent, for the

was encompassed with a deep valley along the entire south

quarter; but the fourth front of the temple, which was south­

cloister, with three walks which reached in length from the

east valley unto that on the west, for it was impossible it should

reach any farther: and this cloister deserves to be mentioned

better than any other under the sun; for while the valley was

very deep, and its bottom could not be seen, if you looked from

above into the depth, this farther vastly high elevatioji of the*

cloister stood upon that height, insomuch, that if any one look­

ed down from the top of the battlements, or down both those

altitudes, he would be giddy, while his sight could not reach

to such an immense depth. This cloister had pillars that stood

in four rows one over against the other all along, for the fourth

row was interwoven into the wall, which [also was built of

stone;] and the thickness of each pillar was such, that three

men might, with their arms extended, fathom it round, and

join their hands again, while its length was twenty-seven feet

with a double spiral at its basis; and the number of all the piL-

lars [in that court] was a hundred and sixty-two. Their chap­

iters were made with sculptures after the Corinthian order,

and caused an amazement [to the spectators,] by reason of the

grandeur of the whole. These four rows of pillars included
