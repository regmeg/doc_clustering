408 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS. Book XVI.

somewhat to purpose, when every one that could oppose him

was taken away. When therefore Andromachus and his friends

were driven away, and had no discourse nor freedom with the

king any longer, the king in the first place, examined by torture

all whom he thought to be faithful to Alexander, whether they

knew of any of his attempts against him; but these died with­

out having any thing to say to that matter, which made the king

more zealous [after discoveries,] when he could not find out

what evil proceedings he suspected them of. As for Antipater,

he was very sagacious to raise a calumny against those that were

really innocent, as if their denial was only their constancy and

fidelity [to Alexander,] and thereupon provoked Herod to disco­

ver, by the torture of great numbers, what attempts were still con­

cealed. Now there was a certain person among the many that

were tortured, who said, that he knew that the young man had of­

ten said, that when he was commended as a tall man in his body,

and a skilful marksman, and that in his> commendable exercises

he exceeded all men, these qualifications given him by nature,

though good in themselves, were not advantageous to him, be­

cause his father was grieved at them, and envied him for them; and

that when he walked along with his father he endeavoured to de­

press and shorten himself that he might not appear too tall, and

that when he shot at any thing as he was hunting, when his father

was by, he missed his mark on purpose, for he knew how ambitious

his father was of being superior in such exercises. So when the

man was tormented about this saying, and had ease given his

body after it, he added, that he had his brother Aristobulus for

his assistance, and contrived to lie in wait for their father, as they

were hunting, and kill him: and when they had done so, to fly

to Rome, and desire to have the kingdom given them. There

were also letters of the young man found, written to his brother,

wherein he complained, that his father did not act justly in giv­

ing Antipater a country, whose [yearly] revenues amounted to

two hundred talents. Upon these confessions Herod presently

thought he had somewhat to depend on, in his own opinion, as

to his suspicion about his sons: So he took up Alexander and

bound him: yet did he still continue to be uneasy, and was not

quite satisfied of the truth of what he had heard; and when he

came to recollect himself, he found that they had only made ju­

venile complaints and contentions, and that it was an incredible

thing, that when his son should have slain him, he should openly

go to Rome [to beg the kingdom,] so he was desirous to have

some surer mark of his son's wickedness, and was very solicitous

about it, that he might not appear to have condemned him to be

put in prison too rashly; so he tortured the principal of Alex­

ander's friends, and out not a few of them to death, without get-
