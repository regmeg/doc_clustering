come upon him u danger that would hazard his entire domin­

ions, after Antony had been beaten at the battle of Actium by

Caesar [Octavian;} for at that time both Herod's enemies and

friends despaired of his affairs, for it was not probable that he

would remain without punishment, who had showed so much

friendship for Antony. So it happened that his friends despair­

ed, and had no hopes of his escape, but for his enemies, they all

outwardly appeared to be troubled at his case, but were privately

very glad of it, as hoping to obtain a change for the better.

As for Herod himself, he saw that there was no one of royal dig­

nity left but Hyrcanus, and therefore he thought it would be for

his advantage not to suffer him to be an obstacle in his way any

longer; for that in case he himself survived, and escaped the dan­

ger he was in, he thought it the safest way to put it out of the

power of such a man to make any attempt against him, at such

C' mctures of affairs, as was more worthy of the kingdom than

imself; and in case he should bo slain by Caesar, his envy

prompted him to desire to slay him that would otherwise be

king after him.

safely might; and desired him to write about these matters to

Malchus, who was then governor of Arabia, to receive them,

and to secure them [from Herod,] for that if they went away,

and Herod's affairs proved to be, as it was likely they would be,

by reason of Caesar's enmity to him, they should then be the on­

ly persons that could take the government, and this both on ac­

count of the royal family they were of, and on account of the

good disposition of the multitude to them. While she used these

persuasions, Hyrcanus put off her suit; but as she showed that

she was a woman, and a contentious woman too, and would not

desist either night or clay, but would always be speaking to him

about these matters, and about Herod's treacherous designs, she

at last prevailed with him to entrust Dositheus, one of his friends,

with a letter, wherein his resolution was declared; and he de­

sired the Arabian governor to send to him some horsemen, who

should receive him, and conduct him to the lake Asphaltites,

which is from the bounds of Jerusalem three hundred furlongs:

and he did therefore trust Dositheus with this letter, because he
