120 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS. Book XL

time; and she entreated God to have mercy upon her, and make

her words appear persuasive to the king, and render her counte­

nance more beautiful than it was before, that both by her words

and beauty she might succeed, for the averting of the king's an­

ger, in case he were at all irritated against her, and for the con­

solation of those of her own country, now they were in the ut­

most danger of perishing; as also that he would excite a hatred

in the king against the enemies of the Jews, and those that had

contrived their future destruction, if they be proved to be con­

temned by him.

9. When Esther had used this supplication for three days,

she put off those garments, changed her habit, and adorned

herself as became a queen, and took two of her hand-maids with

her, the one of which supported her, as she gently leaned upon

her, and the other followed after, and lifted up her large train

(which swept along the ground,) with the extremities of her

fingers: And thus she came to the king, having a blushing red­

ness in her countenance, with a pleasant agreeableness in her be­

haviour, yet did she go in to him with fear; and as soon as she

was come over against him, as he was sitting on his throne, in

leaped from his throne and took her in his arms, and recovered

her, by embracing her, and speaking comfortably to her, and

exhorting her to be of good cheer, and not to suspect any thing

that was said on account of her coming to him without being

called, because that law was made for subjects, but that she,

who was a queen, as well as he a king, might be entirely se­

cure : and as he said this, he put the sceptre into her hand, and

laid his rod upon her neck, on account of the law; and so freed

her from her fear. And after she had recovered herself by these

encouragements, she said, "My lord, it is not easy for me, on

"the sudden, to say what hath happened, for as soon as I saw

"thee to be great, and comely, and terrible, my spirit departed

"from me, and I had no soul left in me." And while it was

with difficulty, and in a low voice, that she could say thus
