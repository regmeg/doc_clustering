216 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JKWS. Book XIII.

3. But when the people of Jerusalem heard that Jonathan was

taken, and that the soldiers who were with him were destroyed,

they deplored his sad fate, and there was earnest inquiry made

about him by every body, and a great and just fear fell upon

them, and made them sad, lest, now they were deprived of the

courage and conduct of Jonathan, the nations about them should

bear them ill-will; and as they were before quiet on account ot

Jonathan, they should now rise up against them, and by making

war with them, should force them into the utmost dangers. And

indeed what they suspected really befell them, for when those na­

tions heard of the death of Jonathan, they began to make war

with the Jews as now destitute of a governor; and Trypho him­

self got an army together, and had an intention to go up to Judea;

and make war against its inhabitants. But when Simon saw that

the people of Jerusalem were terrified at the circumstances they

were in, he desired to make a speech to them, and thereby to

render them more resolute in opposing Trypho when he should

come against them. He then called the people together into the

temple, and thence began thus to encourage them, "O my coun-

"that I should be sparing of my own life, nor so far worse than

"they as to avoid and refuse what they thought the most honour-

"able of all things, I mean to undergo death for your laws, and

for that worship of God which is peculiar to you; I will there­

fore give such proper demonstrations as will show that I am

their own brother; and I am so bold as to expect that I shall

avenge their blood upon our enemies, and deliver you all with

your wives and children, from the injuries they intend against

"destruction by them, for I see that these nations have you in

"contempt, as being without a governor, and that they thence

"are encouraged to make war against you."

4. By this speech of Simon's he inspired the multitude with

courage, and as they had been before dispirited through fear, they

were now raised to a good hope of better things, insomuch, that the

whole multitude of the people cried out all at once, that Simon
