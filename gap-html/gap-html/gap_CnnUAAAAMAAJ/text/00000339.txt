Chap. V. ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS. 333

Antony were to fight for the supreme power of the world; but

Herod having enjoyed a country that was very fruitful, and that

now for a long time, and having received great taxes, and raised

great armies therewith, got together a body of men, and care­

fully furnished them with all necessaries, and designed them as

auxiliaries for Antony: But Antony said, he had no want of his

assistance; but he commanded him to punish the king of Arabia;

for he had heard both from him, and from Cleopatra, how per­

fidious he was; for this was what Cleopatra desired, who thought

it for her own advantage, that those two kings should do one

another as great a mischief as possible. Upon this message from

Antony, Herod returned back, but kept his army with him, in

order to invade Arabia immediately. So when his army of

horsemen and footmen was ready, he marched to Diospolis,

whither the Arabians came also to meet them, for they were

not unapprised of this war that was coming upon them; and af­

ter a great battle had been fought, the Jews had the victory.

But afterward there were gotten together another numerous ar­

conquerors, and had not permitted their enemy so much as to

come to a close fight with them. And when they were so tu­

multuous, and showed such great alacrity, the king resolved to

make use of that zeal the multitude then exhibited; and when

he had assured them he would not be behindhand with them in

courage, he led them on, and stood before them all in his ar­

mour, all the regiments following him in their several ranks:

Whereupon a consternation fell upon the Arabians; for when

they perceived that the Jews were not to be conquered, and were

full of spirit, the greater part of them ran away, and avoided

fighting, and they had been quite destroyed, had not Athenion

fallen upon the Jews, and distressed them, for this man was

Cleopatra's general over the soldiers she had there, and was at

enmity with Herod, and very wistfully looked on to see what

the event of the battle would be: He had also resolved, that in

case the Arabians did any thing that was brave and successful,

he would He still, but in case they were beaten, as it really hap­
