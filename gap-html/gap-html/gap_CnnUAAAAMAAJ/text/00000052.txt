OJF TH* JEWS. Book IX,

.brought their o.wn gods into Samaria; and by worshippmg them,

.as was the custom of their own countries, they provoked Almigh­

ty God to be angry and displeased at them, for a plague .seized

.upon them, by which they were destroyed; and when they found

no cure for their miseries, they learned by the oracle that they

.ought to worship Almighty God, as the method for their deliv­

erance. So they sent ambassadors to l|he king of Assyria, iand

desired him to send them some of those priests of-the Israelites

'whom he had taken .captive. And when he thereupon sent them,

and the people were by them taught the laws, and the holy wor-

ship of God, they worshipped him in a respectful manner, and

the plague ceased immediately; and indeed they continue to

make use of the very same customs to this very time, and are-

called in the Hebrew tongue Cutheans, but in the Greek tongue

Samaritans. And when they see the Jews in prosperity, they

pretend that they are changed, and allied to them, and call them

kinsmen, as though they were derived from Joseph, and had by

that means an original alliance with them: but when they see

them falling into a low condition, they say they are no way re-

Jated to them, and that the Jews have no right tp expect any

kindness or marks of kindred from them, but they declare that

they are sojourners, that come from other .countries. But of

these we shall have a more seasonable opportunity to discourse

hereafter.
