560 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS. Book XV.

rod, and desirous to have his subjects preserved, he gave leave to

them in the first place to export corn, and assisted them every

way, both in purchasing and exporting the same, so that he was

the principal, if not the only person, who afforded them what

help they had. And Herod taking care the people should under­

stand that this help came from himself, did thereby not only re­

move from him the ill opinion of those that formerly hated him,

but gave them the greatest demonstration possible of his good­

will to them, and care of them; for, in the first place, as for

those who were able to provide their own food, he distributed

to them their proportion of corn in the exactest manner, but for

those many that were not able, either by reason of their old age,

or any other infirmity, to providefood for themselves, hemadethis

provision for them, that the bakers should make the bread ready

for them. He also took care that they might not be hurt by

the dangers of winter, since they were in great want of clothing

also, by reason of the utter destruction and consumption of their

sheep and goats, till they had no wool to make use of, nor any

thing else to cover themselves withal. And when he had pro­

cured these things for his own subjects, he went farther, in or­

der to provide necessaries for their neighbours, and gave seed to

the Syrians, which thing turned greatly to his own advantage

also, this charitable assistance being afforded most seasonably to

their fruitful soil, so that every one had now a plentiful provi­

sion of food. Upon the whole, when the harvest of the land was

approaching, he sent no fewer than fifty thousand men, whom he

had sustained, into the country; by which means he both repair­

ed the afflicted condition of his own kingdom with great genero­

sity and diligence, and lightened the afflictions of his neighbours,

who were under the same calamities, for there was nobody who

had been in want that was left destitute of a suitable assistance by

him: nay, farther, there were neither any people, nor any cities,

nor any private men, who were to make provision for the

multitudes, and on that account were in want of support, and

had recourse to him, but received what they stood in need of, in­

somuch, that it appeared upon a computation, that the number

of cori of wheat, often attick medimni a-piece, that were given

to foreigners, amounted to ten thousand, and the number that

was given in his own kingdom was about fourscore thousand.

Now it happened that this care of his, and this seasonable bene­

faction, had such influence on the Jews, and was so cried up

among other nations, as to wipe off that old hatred which his vio­

lation of some of then: customs, during his reign, had procured

him among all the nation; and that this liberality of his assistance

in this their greatest necessity was full satisfaction for all that

he had done of that nature, as it also procured him great fame
