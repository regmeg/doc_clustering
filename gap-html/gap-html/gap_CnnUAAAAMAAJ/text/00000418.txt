the Arabian government afforded them, and jet being very un­

easy at the injuries they had done him, he went all over Tra-

chonitis, and slew their relations; whereupon these robbers were

more angry than before, it being a law among them to be aven­

ged on the murderers of their relations by all possible means, so

they continued to tear and rend every thing under Herod's do-

miniou with impunity: Then did he discourse about these rob­

beries to Saturninus and VoLumuius, and required that they

ifaould be punished; upon which occasion they still tbe more

confirmed themselves in their robberies, and became mjre nu­

merous; and made very great disturbances, laying waste the

countries and villages that belonged to Herod's kingdom, and

killing those men whom they caught, till these unjust pro­

ceedings came to be like a real war, for the robbers were now

become about a thousand. At which Herod was sore displeas­

ed, and required the robbers, as weli as the money which he

had lent Dbodas, by Sylleus, which was sixty talents, and since

the time of payment was now past, he desired to have it paid him;

but Sylleus, who had laid Obodas aside, and managed all by him­

self, denied that the robbers were in Arabia, and put off the pay­

ment of the money; about which there was a hearing before

* Saturninus and Volumnius, who were then the presidents of  
Syria. At last, he, by their means, agreed, that within thirty

days time Herod should be paid his money, and that each ot

them should deliver up the other's subjects reciprocally. Now,

as to Herod, there was not one of the other's subjects found in

his kingdom, either as doing any injustice, or on any other

account, but it was proved that the Arabians had the robbers

amongst them.

2. When this day appointed for payment of the money was

past, without Sylleus' performing any part of his agreement,

and he was gone to Rome, Herod demanded the payment of the

money, and that the robbers that were in Arabia should be de­

livered up; and, by the permission of Saturninus and Volum­

nius executed the judgment himself upon those that were re->

fractory. He took an army that he had, and led it into Arabia,

and in three days time, by forced marches, arrived at the

garrison wherein the robbers were, he made an assault upon

them, and took them all, and demolished the place, which was

called Raepta, but did no harm to any others; but as the Ara­

bians came to their assistance, under Nacebus their captain, there

ensued a battle, wherein a few of Herod's soldiers, and Nacebus,

* These joint presidents of Syria, Saturninus and Volumnius, were not perhaps  
of equal authority, but the latter like a procurator under the former, as the
very

learned Noris and Pagi, and wiih them Dr. Hudson, determine.
