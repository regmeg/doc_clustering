tion for the work about the temple, fell also the day of the

king's inauguration, which he kept of an old custom as a festi­

val, and it now coincided with the other, which coincidence ot

them both, made the festival most illustrious.

7. There was also an occult passage built for the king: it led

from Antonia to the inner temple, at its eastern gate; over which

he also erected for himself a tower, that he might have the op­

portunity of a subterraneous ascent to the temple, in order to

guard against any sedition which might be made by the people

against their kings. It is also * reported, that during the time

that the temple was building, it did not rain in the daytime,

but that the showers fell in the night, so that the work was not

hindered. And this our fathers have delivered to us; nor is it

incredible, if any one have regard to the manifestations of God.

And thus was performed the work of the rebuilding of the temple.

* This tradition which Josephus here mentions, as delivered down from fathers  
to their chitdren, of this particular, remarkable circumstance relating to the
build­

ing of Herod's temple, is a demonstration that such its building wns a known

thing in Judea at that time. He was born but 46 years after it is related to
have

been finished, and might himself have seen and spoken wiih some of the
builders

themselves, and with a great number of those that had seen it building. The

doubt therefore about the (ruth of this history, of the pulling down and
rebuilding

this temple by Horod, which some weak people have indulged, was not then much

greater than it soon may be, whether or not our St. Paul's Church in London
was

burnt down in the fire of London, A. D. 1666. and rebuilt by Sir Christopher

Wren a little afterward.
