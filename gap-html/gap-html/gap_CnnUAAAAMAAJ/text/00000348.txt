842 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS. Book XV

greatly honoured him beyond that river, though he were to be

entirely under Herod's government, and that it was a most in­

credible thing that he should enterprise any thing by way of in­

novation, and not at all agreeable to his temper, but that this

was 9 plot of Herod's contrivance.

4. And this was the fate of Hyrcanus; and thus did he end

his iife, after he had endured various and manifold turns of for­

tune in his lifetime: For he was made high priest of the Jew­

ish nation in the beginning of his mother Alexandra's reign,

who held the government nine years; and when, after his mo­

ther's death, he took the kingdom himself, and held it three

months, he lost it, by the means of his brother Aristobulus.

He was then restored by Pompey, and received all sorts of ho­

nour from him, and enjoyed them forty years; but when he

was again deprived by Antigonus, and was maimed in his body,

he was made a captive by the Parthians, and thence returned

home again after some time, on account of the hopes that He­

rod had given him; none of which came to pass according to

his expectation, but he still conflicted with many misfortunes

through the whole course of his life; and what was the heaviest

calamity of all, as we have related already, he came to an end

which was undeserved by him. His character appeared to be

that of a man of a mild and moderate disposition, and suffered

was not agreeable either to justice or piety.

5. Now Herod as soon as he had put Hyrcanus out of the

way, made haste to Caesar; and because he could not have any

hopes of kindness from him, on account of the friendship he had

for Antony, he had a suspicion of Alexandra, lest she should take

this opportunity to bring the multitude to a revolt, and intro­

duce a sedition into the affairs of the kingdom; so he commit­

ted the care of every thing to his brother Pheroras, and placed

his mother Cypros, and his sister [Salome,] and the whole

family at Massada, and gave him a charge, that if he should

hear any sad news about him, he should take care of the gov­

ernment: But as to Mariamne his wife, because of the mis­

understanding between her and his sister, and his sister's mo­

ther, which made it impossible for them to live together, he

placed her at Alexandrium, with Alexandra her molher, and

left his treasurer Joseph and Sohemus of Iturea, to take care

of that fortress. These two had been very faithful to him

from the beginning, and were now left as a guard to the wo­
