92 jwmguiTiES OF THE JEWS. Book X,

bouring nations, and especially the Cutheans, whom Shalman-

ezer, king of Assyria, had brought out of Persia and Media,

and had planted- in- Samaria, when he carried the peopk of

Israel captives, besought the governors, and those that had the

care of such affairs, that they would interrupt the Jews, both

hi the rebuilding of their city, and in the building of their tem­

ple. Npw as these men were corrupted by them with money,

they sold the Cutheans their interest for rendering this building

a slow and a careless work, for Cyrus, who was busy about

other wars, knew nothing of all this; and it so happened, that

when he had led his army against the * Massagetae he ended his

life. But when Cambyses, the son of Cyrus, had taken the

kingdom, the governor in Syria, and Pnenicia, and in the

countries of Ammon, and Moab, and Samaria, wrote an epis­

tle to Cambyses; whose contents were as follows: " To OUF Lord

"Cambyses; we thy servants, Rathunms the historiographer,

H and Semellius the scribe, and the rest that are thy judges in

"Syria and Phenicia, sendeth greeting: If is fit, O King,

"that thou shouldest know that these Jews which were car-

"ried to Babylon, are come into our country, and are build-

"ing that rebellious and wicked city, and its market places,

"and setting up its walls, and raising up the temple: know

"therefore, that when these things are finished, they will not

*' be willing to pay tribute, nor will they submit to thy com-  
"mands, but will resist kings, and will choose rather to rule over

M others, than be ruled over themselves. We therefore thought

"it proper to write to thee, O king, while tire works about;

"the- temple are going on so fast, and not to overlook this

"matter, that thou mayest search into the books of thy fathers,

"for thou wilt find in them, that the Jews have been rebels,

"and enemies to kings, as hath their city been also, which,

"for that reason, hath been till now laid waste. We thought

"proper also to inform thee of this matter, because thou niay-

"est otherwise perhaps be ignorant of it, that if this city be

* Josi-phus here follows Herodotus, and those that related how Cyrus m«de  
war with the Scythians and Massagets, rear the Caspian sea, and perished in
it;

while Xenophon's account, which appears never to have been seen by Josephus,

that Cyrus died in peace, in his own country of Persia, is attested to by the

writers of the affairs of Alexander the Great, when they agree that he found

Cyrus" sepulchre at Pasargadas, near Perscpolis. This account of Xenophon's

is also conHrmcd by the circumstances of Cambyses, upon his succession to

Cyrus, who, instead of a war to- avenge his father's death upon the Scythians
and

Massagets, and to prevent those nations from overruning his northern pro­

vinces, which would have been the natural consequence of his father's ill
success

and death there, went immediately to an Egyptian war, long ago begun by Cyrus,

according to Xenophon, page 644, and conquered that kingdom, nor is there,
that

1 ever heard of the least mention in the reign of Cambyses of any war against
the

Scythians and Massagets that lie was ever engaged in all his life.
