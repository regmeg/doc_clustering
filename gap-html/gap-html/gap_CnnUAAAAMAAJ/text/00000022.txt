riches also, and betook themselves to flight. And those lepers

who had departed from Samaria, and were gone to the camp

of the Syrians, of whom we made mention a little before, when

they were in the camp, saw nothing but great quietness and si­

lence : accordingly they entered into it, and went hastily into one

of their tents, and when they saw nobody there they eat and

drank, and carried garments and a great quantity of gold, and

hid it out of the camp ; after which they went into another tent,

and carried off what was in it, as they did at the former, and

this did they for several times, without the least interruption

from any body. So they gathered thereby that the enemies

were departed; whereupon they reproached themselves that

they did not inform Joram and the citizens of it. So they came

to the walls of Samaria, and called aloud to the watchmen, and

told them in what state the enemies were, as did these tell the

king's guards, by whose means Joram came to know of it; who

then sent for his friends, and the captains of his host, and said to

them, That "he suspected that this departure of the king of Sy-

"horsemen to search all the country, as far as Jordan, that if

"they were seized by an ambush of the enemy, they might be

"a security to your army, that they may not go out as if they

"suspected nothing, nor undergo the like misfortune; and,

"(said he), those horsemen may be numbered among those

"that have died by the famine, supposing they be caught and

"destroyed by the enemy." So the king was pleased with this

opinion and sent such as might search out the truth, who per­

formed their journey over a road that was without any enemies,

but found it full of provisions, and of weapons, that they had

therefore thrown away, and left behind them, in order to their

being light and expeditious in their flight. When the king heard

this, he sent out the multitude to take the spoils of the camp;

which gains of theirs was not of things of small value, but they

took a great quantity of gold, and a great quantity of silver,

and flocks of all kinds of cattle. They also possessed themselves

of [so many] ten thousand measures of wheat and barley, as they

never in the least dreamed of; and were not only freed from
