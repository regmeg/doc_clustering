Chap. XL ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS. 87

ment of them, he procured the belief of their truth, and the

opinion of [a sort of] divinity for himself, among the multitude.

He also wrote and left behind him what made manifest the acÂ­

curacy and undeniable veracity of his predictions; For he saith,

That " when he was in Susa, the metropolis of Persia, and went

"out into the field with his companions, there was, on the sud-

"den, a motion and concussion of the earth, and that he was

"left alone by himself, his friends flying away from him; and

"that he was disturbed, and fell on his face, and on his two

"hands, and that a certain person touched him, and, at the same

"time, bid him rise, and see what would befall his countrymen

"after many generations. He also related, that when he stood

"up, he was shown a great ram, with many horns growing out

"of his head, and that the last was higher than the rest: that

"after this he looked to the west, and saw a he-goat carried

"through the air from that quarter; that he rushed upon the

"ram with violence, and smote him twice with his horns, and

*' overthrew him to the ground, and trampled upon him; that  
"afterward he saw a very great horn growing out of the head

"of the he-goat, and that when it was broken off, four horns

"grew up that were exposed to each of the four winds, and he

"wrote that out of them arose another lesser horn, which, as he

"said, waxed great; and that God showed to him, that it should

"fight against his nation, and take their city by force, and bring

"be offered for one thousand two hundred and ninety-six days."

Daniel wrote that he saw these visions in the plain of Susa; and

he hath informed us, that God interpreted the appearance of this

vision after the following manner; "He said that the ram signi-

"fied the kingdoms of the Medes and Persians, and the horns

*' those kings that were to reign in them: and that the last  
^' horn signified the last king, and that he should exceed all the

"kings in riches and glory: that the goat signified that one

"should come and reign from the Greeks, who should twice

"fight with the Persian, and overcome him in battle, and should

"receive his entire dominion; that by the great horn which

"sprang out of the forehead of the he-goat was meant the first

"king; and that the springing up of four horns upon its falling

"off', and the conversion of every one of them to the four quar-

"ters of the earth, signified the successors that should arise after

"the death of the first king, and the partition of the kingdom

"among them, and that they should be neither his children, nor

"of his kindred, that should reign over the habitable earth for

"many years; and that from among them there should arise

"a certain king that should overcome our nation and their laws,

"and should take away their political government, and should
