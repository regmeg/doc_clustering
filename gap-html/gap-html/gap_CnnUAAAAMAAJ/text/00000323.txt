Chap. XVI. ANTIQUITIES OK THE JEWS. 317

solemnity of the fast, as if n periodical revolution of calamities

had returned, since that which befell the Jews under Pompey, for

the Jews were taken by him on the same day, and this was after

twenty-seven years' time. So when Sosius had dedicated a crown

of gold to God, he marched away from Jerusalem, and carried

Antigonus with him in bonds to Antony; but Herod was afraid

lest Antigonus should be kept in prison [only] by Antony, and

that when he was carried to Rome by him, he might get his

cause to be heard by the senate, and might demonstrate, as he

was himself of the royal blood, and Herod but a private man,

that therefore it belonged to his sons however to have the king­

dom, on account of the family they were of, in case he had him­

self offended the Romans by what he had done. Out of Herod's

fear of this it was, that he, by giving Antony a great deal of

money, endeavoured to persuade him to have Antigonus slain,

which if it were once done, he should be free from that fear. And

thus did the government of the Asamoneans cease, a hundred

twenty and six years after it was first set up. This family was

a splendid and an illustrious one, both on account of the nobility

of their stock, and of the dignity of the high priesthood, as also

for the glorious actions their ancestors had performed for our

nation: but these men lost the government by their dissentions

one with another, and it came to Herod the son of Antipater,

who was of no more than a vulgar family, and of no eminent

extraction, but one that was subject to other kings; and this is

what history tells us was the end of the Asamonean family.
