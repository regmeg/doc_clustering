426 ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS, Book XVI,

already made haste to bring his purpose to a conclusion. He al­

so brought out three hundred of the officers that were under an

accusation, as also Tero and his son, and the barber that accused

them, before an assembly, and brought an accusation against them

all; whom the multitude stoned with whatsoever came to hand,

and thereby slew them. Alexander and also Aristobulus were

brought to Sebaste by their father's command, and there strang­

led; but their dead bodies were in the night time carried to

Alexandrium, where their uncle by the mother's side, and the

greatest part of their ancestors, had been deposited.

that such an inveterate hatred might increase so much [on both

sides,] as to proceed farther, and overcome nature: but it may

justly deserve consideration, whether it be to be laid to the charge

of the young men, that they gave such an occasion to their fa­

ther's anger, and led him to do what he did, and by going on long

in the same way, put things past remedy, and brought him to

use them so unmercifully; or whether it be to be laid to the fa­

ther's charge, that he was so hardhearted, and so very tender in

the desire of government, and of other things that would tend to

his glory, that he would take no one into a partnership with him,

that so whatsoever he would have done himself might continue

immoveable; or indeed, whether fortune have not greater power

than all prudent reasonings: Whence we are persuaded that hu­

man actions are thereby determined beforehand by an inevit­

able necessity, and we call her Fate, because there is nothing

which is not done by her: wherefore I suppose it will be suffi­

cient to compare this notion with that other, which attributes

somewhat to ourselves, and renders men not unaccountable for

the different conducts of their lives, which notion is no other

than the philosophical determination of our ancient law. Ac­

cordingly of the two other causes of this sad event, any body

may lay the blame on the young men, who acted by youthful

vanity, and pride of their royal birth, that they should bear to

hear the calumnies that were raised against their father, while

certainly they were not equitable judges of the actions of his

life, but ill-natured in suspecting, and intemperate in speaking

of it, and on both accounts easily caught by those that observed

them, and revealed them to gain favour; yet cannot their father

be thought worthy excuse, as to that horrid impiety which he

was guilty of about them, while he ventured, without any cer­

tain evidence of their treacherous designs against him, and

without any proofs that they had made preparation for such

uld Lntin version, as Spanheim truly observes; nor is there any other reason
for it,

I suppose, than the great difficulty of an exact translation.
