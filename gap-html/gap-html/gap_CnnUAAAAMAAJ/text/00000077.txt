preparation, while the season lasted, of corn, and wine, and oil,

that they might have whereon to feed during the winter. When

he had thus discoursed to them, he dismissed them, that every

one might dwell in what place of the country he pleased.

3. Now when this report was spread abroad as far as the na­

tions that bordered on Judea, that Gedaliah kindly entertained

those that came to him, after they had fled away, upon this (on­

ly) condition, that they should pay tribute to the king of Baby­

lon, they also came readily to Gedaliah, and inhabited the coun­

try. And when Johanan and the rulers that were with him

observed the country, and the humanity of Gedaliah, they were

exceedingly in love with him, and told him that Baalis, the

king of the Ammonites, -had sent Ishmael to kill him by treach­

ery, and secretly, that he might have the dominion over the Is- -

raelites, as being of the royal family; and they said that he

might deliver himself from this treacherous design, if he would

give them leave to slay Ishmael, and nobody should know it, for

they told him they were afraid that when he was killed by the

other, the entire ruin of the remaining strength of the Israelites

would ensue: But he professed, That " he did not believe what

"they said, when they told him of such a treacherous design, in

"a man that had been well treated by him; because it was not

"probable that one who, under such a want of all things, had

"so wicked and ungrateful towards his benefactor, that when

*' it would be an instance of wickedness in him not to save him,  
"had he been treacherously assaulted by others to endeavour,

"and that earnestly, to kill him with his own hand: That how-

"was better for himself to be slain by the other, than to de-

"stray a man who fled to him for refuge, and entrusted his own

<( safety to him, and committed himself to his disposal."

4. So Johanan, and the rulers that were with him not being

able to persuade Gedaliah, went away : but after the interval 01

thirty days was over, Ishmael came again to Gedaliah, to the

tity Mispah and ten men with him, and when he had feasted

Ishmael, and those that were with him in a splendid manner, at

his table, and had given them presents, he became disordered in

drink, while he endeavoured to be very merry with them;

and when Ishmael saw him in that case, and that he was drowned

in his cups to the degree of insensibility, and fallen asleep, he

rose on a sudden, with his ten friends, and slew Gedaliah

and those that were with him at the feast, and when he had slain

them, he went out by night, and slew all the Jews that were in

the city, and those soldiers also which were left therein by the

'Babylonians: -But the next day fourscore men came out of the
