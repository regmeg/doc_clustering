"the vilest things, and would certainly suffer the greatest pun-

2. These were the accusations which Herod laid with great

vehemency against his sons before Caesar. Now, the young

men, both while he was speaking, and chiefly at his concluding,

wept, and were in confusion. For, as to themselves, they knew

in their own consciences they were innocent, but because they

were accused by their father, they were sensible, as the truth was,

that it was hard for them to make their apology, since, though

they were at liberty to speak their minds freely as the occasion

required, and might with force and earnestness refute the accusa足

tion, yet was it not now decent so to do. There was therefore

a difficulty how they should be able to speak, and tears, and at

length a deep groan followed, while they were afraid, that if

they said nothing, they should seem to be in this difficulty from

a consciousness of guilt, nor had they any defence ready, by rea足

son of their youth, and the disorder they were under; yet was

not Caesar unapprised, when he looked upon them in the con足

"hadst not produced us here before the common saviour of all,

"for it was in thy power, both as a king, and as a father, to

"punish the guilty, but by thus bringing us to Rome, and mak-

"ing Caesar himself a witness to what is done, thou intimatest

"-that thou intendest to save us, for no one that hath a design to

"slay a man will bring him to the temples, and to the altars:

"yet are our circumstances still worse, for we cannot endure to

"live ourselves any longer, if it be believed that we have injur-

"ed such a father; nay, perhaps it would be worse for us to

"live with this suspicion upon us, that we have injured him,

"than to die without such guilt: and if our open defence may

"be taken to be true, we shall be happy, both in pacifying thee,

"and in escaping the danger we are in, but if this calumny so

"prevails, it is more than enough for us that we have seen the
