the damsel, as being the wife of Herod, and avoided it, because

of the reproaches he should have from Cleopatra on that account,

but he sent, in the most decent manner he could, for the young

man; but added this withal, "Unless he thought it hard upon

"him so to do." When this letter was brought to Herod, he

did not think it safe for him to send one so handsome as was

Aristobulus, in the prime of his life, for he was sixteen years

of age, and of so noble a family, and particularly not to Antony,

the principal man among the Romans, and one that would abuse

him in his amours, and besides, one that openly indulged him­

self in such pleasures, as his power allowed him, without con­

trol. He therefore wrote back to him, That "if this boy

"should only go out of the country, all would be in a state of

"war and uproar, because the Jews were in hopes of a change

"in the government, and to have another king over them."

7. When Herod had thus excused himself to Antony, he re­

solved that he would not entirely permit the child or Alexan­

dra to be treated dishonourably: but his wife Mariamne lay ve­

hemently at him to restore the high priesthood to her brother,

and he judged it was for his advantage so to do, because, if he

once had that dignity, he could not go out of the country. So

he called his friends together, and told them, That " Alexandra

"privately conspired against his royal authority, and endea-

"he might be deprived of the government, and that by An-

"affairs in his stead; and"that this procedure of hers was un-

"just, since she would at the same time deprive her daughter

"of the dignity she now had, and would bring disturbances up-

"on the kingdom, for which he had taken a great deal of pains,

"and had gotten it with extraordinary hazards: that yet

"while he well remembered her wicked practices, he would

"not leave off doing what was right himself, but would even

"now give the youth the high priesthood: and that he for-

"merly set up Ananelus, because Aristobulus was then so

"very young a child." Now when he had said this, not at

random, but as he thought with the best discretion he had, in

order to deceive the women, and those friends whom he had

taken to consult withal, Alexandra, out of the great joy she

had at this unexpected promise, and out of fear from the sus­

picions she lay under, fell a-weeping, and made the following

apology for herself; and said, That "as to the [high] priest-

"hood, she was very much concerned for the disgrace her son

"was under, and so did her utmost endeavours to procure it for

"him, but that as to the kingdom, she had made no attempts,

"and that if it were offered her [for her son,] she would not
