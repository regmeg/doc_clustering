himself very miserable, and presented his sons there, and accusÂ­

ed them of their mad actions, and of their attempts against him:

That " they were enemies to him; and by all the means they were

"able, did their endeavours to show their hatred to their own

"father, and would lake away his life, and so obtain his king-

"dom, after the most barbarous manner; that he had power

"from Caesar to dispose of it, not by necessity, but by choice,

"to him who shall exercise the greatest piety towards him, while

"these my sons are not so desirous of ruling, as they are, upon

"a disappointment thereof, to expose their own life; if so be

"they may but deprive their father of his life, so wild and pollu-

"ted is their mind by time become, out of their hatred to him;

"that whereas he had a long time borne this his misfortune,

"he was now compelled to lay it before Caesar, and to pollute

"his ears with such language, while he himself wants to know

"what severity they have ever suffered from him? or what

"hardships he hath ever laid upon them to make them com-

"plain of him? and how they can think it just, that he should

"not be lord of that kingdom, which he in a long time, and

"with great danger, had gained, and not allow him to keep it

"and dispose of it to him who should deserve it best ? and this,

"with other advantages, he proposes as a reward for the piety

"of such a one as will hereafter imitate the care he hath taken

"the death of his father, because otherwise he cannot come

"at the government; that as for himself, he had hitherto given

"them all that he was able, and what was agreeable to such

"as are subject to the royal authority, and the sons of a

"king: what ornaments they wanted, with servants and deli-

"cate fare, and had married them into the most illustrious

"families, the one [Aristobulus] to his sister's daughter, but

"Alexander to the daughter of king Archelaus; and what was

"the greatest favour of all, when their crimes were so very bad,

"and he had authority to punish them, yet had he not made

"use of it against them, but had brought them before Caesar

"their common benefactor, and had not used the severity which

"either as a father who had been impiously abused, or as a

"king who had been assaulted treacherously, he might have

"done, he made them stand upon the level with him in judg-

"be passed over without punishment, nor himself live in the

"greatest fears; nay, that it was not for their own advantage

"to see the light of the- sun after what they have done,

"although they should escaue at this time, since they had done
