he gave her the cities that were within the river Eleutherus, as

far as Egypt, excepting Tyre and Sidon, which he knew to

have been free cities from their ancestors, although she pressed

him very often to bestow those on her also.

2. When Cleopatra had obtained thus much, and had accom足

panied Antony in his expedition to Armenia, as far as Eu足

phrates she returned back, and came to Apamia and Damascus,

and passed on to Judea, where Herod met her, and farmed of

her parts of Arabia, and those revenues that came to her

from the region about Jericho. This country bears that bal足

sam, which is the most precious drug that is there, and grows-

there alone. The place bears also palm-trees, both many in

number, and those excellent in their kind. When she was there,

and was very often with Herod, she endeavoured to have crim足

inal conversation with the king: Nor did she affect secrecy in

the indulgence of such sort of pleasures; and perhaps she had in

some measure .a passion of love to him, or rather, what is most

probable, she laid a treacherous snare for him, by aiming to

obtain such adulterous conversation from him: However, upon

the whole, she seemed overcome with love to him. Now Herod

had a great while borne no good-will to Cleopatra, as knowing

that she was a woman irksome to all; and at that time he thought

her particularly worthy of his hatred, if this attempt proceeded

"should come upon him as that he should stand in need of her

"fidelity." But when he thought to follow this advice, his

friends would not let him; and told him, That "in the first

"place it was not right to attempt so great a thing, and run

"himself thereby into the utmost danger: and they laid hard

"at him, and begged of him, to undertake nothing rashly, for

"that Antony would never bear it, no not though any one

"should evidently lay before his eyes that it was for his own

"advantage; and that the appearance of depriving him of her

"conversation, by this violent and treacherous method, would

"probably set his affections more in a flame than before. Nor

"did it appear that he could offer any thing of tolerable weight

"in his defence, this defence being against such a woman as
