"were present at the writing of this decree, Lucius Culpurnius

"Piso of the Menenian tribe, Servius Papinias Potitus of the

"Lemonian tribe, Caius Caninius Rebiiius of the Terentine

"tribe, Publius Tidetius, Lucius Apulinus, the son of Lucius,

"of the Sergian tribe, Flavius, the son of Lucius, of the Lemo-

"nian tribe, Publius Platius, the son of Pnblius, of the Papyrian

"tribe, Marcus Acilius, the son of Marcus, of the Mecian tribe,

"Lucius Erucius, the son of Lucius, of the Stellatine tribe,

"Marcus Quintius Plancillus, the son of Marcus, of the Pol-

"lian tribe, and Publius Serius. Publius Dolabella, and Mar-

"cus Antonius, the consuls, made this reference to the senate,

"that as to those things which by the decree of the senate,

"Caius Ca3sar had adjudged about the Jews, and yet had not

"hitherto that decree brought into the treasury, it is our will, as

"it is also the desire of Publius Dolabella, and Marcus Antonius,

"our consuls, to have these decrees put into the public tables, and

"brought to the city questors, that they may take care to have

"them put upon the double tables. This was done before the

"fifth of the ides of February, in the temple of Concord. Now

"the ambassadors from Hyrcanus the high priest were these,

"Lysimachus the son of Pausanius, Alexander the son of The-

"odorus, Patroculus the son of Cheras, and Jonathan the son

"of Onias."

11. Hyrcanus sent also one of these ambassadors to Dolabella,

who was then the prefect of Asia, and desired him to dismiss

the Jews from military services, and to preserve to them the

customs of their forefathers, and to permit them to live ac­

cording to them. And when Dolabella had received Hyrcan­

us' letter, without any farther deliberation, he sent an epistle

to all the Asiatics, and particularly to the city of the Ephesians,

the metropolis of Asia, about the Jews, a copy of which epistle

here follows:

12. "When Artemon was prytanis, on the first day of the

"month Leneon, Dolabella imperator, to the senate, and magis-

"trates, and people of the Ephesians, sendeth greeting: Alex-

"ander, the son of Theodorus, the ambassador of Hyrcanus,

"the son of Alexander the high priest and ethnarch of the Jews,

"appeared before me, to show that his countrymen could not

"go into their armies, because they are not allowed to bear

"arms, or to travel on the Sabbath days, nor there to procure

"themselves those sorts of food which they have been used to

"eat from the times of their forefathers; I do therefore grant

"them a freedom, from going into the army, as the former pre-

"fects have done, and permit them to use the customs of their

"forefathers, in assembling together for sacred and religious

"purposes, as their law requires, and for collecting oblations
