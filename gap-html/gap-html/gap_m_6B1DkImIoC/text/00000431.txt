ROMAN HISTORY. 429

* unsolicited, to the demand of my .son, and the request  
'which I add in his favour.

His request was granteJwithout difficulty; snd his son,

P. Licinius, was returned military tribune with consular

power, together with those whom we have mentioned

above. Titjnius and Genucius, military tribuoes, march­

ed against the Falisci and Capenates, and acting with

grealer bravery than prudence, fell headlong into an

ambuscade. ^Genucius paid dear for his temerity, for he

was killed fighting valiantly at the head of his troops.

Titinius rallied his men, after they had recovered from

their fright, and having gained an eminence, drew them

up again in order of battle; but he took care not to risk

another engagement upon fair ground.

The disgrace was greater than all the loss they sus­

tained, which, however, in the consequesce was near

proving a total defeat, such was the consternation, not

only at Rome, where fame had exaggerated every cir­

cumstance, but also in the camp before Veii. For a re­

port having been circulated all over the-camp, that the

victorious Capenates and Falisci had cut off the Roman,

troops with both their generals, and were in full march

and at no great distance, with all the Etrurian youth for

Veil, it was with much difficulty the soldiers coutd be

prevented from flying outright. The alarm was still,

greater at Rome, f»r there they weje persuaded- thai the

camp at Veil was already attacked, and part of the ene­

my in full march to attack the city. The citizens flew

to the ramparts-, and the ladies, whom the general con­

sternation had driven put of their houses, offered up sup­

plications in the temples, imploring the gods, that if the

Romans had by proper rites renewed the neglected cere­

monies, if the prodigies had been duly expiated, they

would protect the temples, houses, and walls of Rome

from destruction, and turn all fhe present terror against

Veii.
