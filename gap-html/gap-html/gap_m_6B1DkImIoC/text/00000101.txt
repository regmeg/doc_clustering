"might fall upon his own family: that the number of

"his family affected him prodigiously; and, for that

"reason, he intended to make his own house as thin as

"he had done the senate-house, so that he might leave

"no representative, nor heir to his crown. For his

"own part, that he had escaped his father's fury, amidst

"swords and daggers, and was fully covinced, that he

"could be safe nowhere, but among the enemies of

"Tarquin. For, that they might not be imposed on,

"the war was by no means discontinued, as it was pre-

"tended ; but only with a view of attacking them upon

"an occasion, when they should be lulled in security.

"If there was no place among them to serve as a refuge

"for the distressed, he would wander all over Latium;

"and there, should there be occasion, he should make

"his suit to the .Silqui, the Volsci, and Hernici,* till he

"should have the good fortune to meet with some hos-

"pliable power, who knew how to protect children

"from the cruelty and unnatural tyranny of parents.

"Perhaps too, among some of these people, he might be

â€¢' able to" raise up an enemy to this overbearing monarch

"and his mighty subjects."

When they saw that he seemed to be going, swelled

with resentment, if they should make no advances to

stop him, he met with a handsome reception from the

Gabini. "They bid him not be surprized, that the man

"who could act as he had done, to his subjects and al-

"lies, if at last be treated his children in the same inhu-

"man manner. Nay, if every other object should fail,

"be would wreak his vengeance on himself. To them,

"however, he was excessively welcome; and they had

"no doubt, but in a short time, by his assistance, they

"would be able to carry the war from Gabli, to the ve-

"ry walls of Rome."
