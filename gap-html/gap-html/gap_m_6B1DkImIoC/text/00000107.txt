A dispute about the excellency of Wives.

A HE Rutuli were considered as a very wealthy na­

tion in that age and country, and were in possession of

Ardea. It was their riches alone that gave rise to the

war: For Tarquin having drained his treasury to de­

fray the expence of his public works, was speculating

for a new supply to himself; * and that he might, by a

large booty, soothe the minds of the populace, who,

besides their dislike of him for other acts of tyranny,

were enraged at the oppressive manner in which they

hatl been obliged to serve the mechanics, and do other

servile work. He made an attempt to take Ardea by

storm; but having failed in the attempt, he tried to dis­

tress the besieged by blockading their city, and raising

works against it.

When an army is encamped, and the war rather tedi­

ous than violent, it generally happens that they come

and go without restraint; though' that indulgence only

extends to the officers. The young princes sometimes

spent their leisure hours in visiting and entertaining one

another.

One day, while they were enjoying themselves over

a bottle with Sextus Tarquinius, where Collatinus Tar-

quinius, the son of Egerius, also supped, the conversa­

tion happened to turn on the merit of wives. Every

one was loud in the praises of his own; and the dispute

turning hot, " What occasion is there for words," said

Collatinus, " since you can be satisfied, in a few hours,

"how much my Lucretia is superior to the rest. If then

"" we have yet the vigour of youth let us mount our horses,

"and examine the conduct of our wives on the spot;

"each of us will he able to judge with the greater pre-

"cision of the employment of the ladies, surprised with

"a visit from their husbands, of which they had not the

"most distant expectation."

They were all heated with wine: "Come, let us go,"
