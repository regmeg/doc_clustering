xii . THE TRANSLATOR, fa

We shall conclude the character of this great HistoÂ­

rian, with an extract from a modern Author*, who,

having done justice toother Roman historians, does LIVY

the noblest homage, in the following elegant encomium:

OF mightier spirit, of majestic fame,

With powers proportion'd to the Roman name:

When Rome's fierce Eagle his broad wings unfurl'di

And shadow'd with them all the subject world,

In bright pre-eminence, that Greece might own,

Sublimer LIVY claims th' historic throne:

With that rich eloquence, whose golden light

Brings the full scene distinctly to the sight:

That zeal of truth which interest cannot bend;

That fire, which freedom ever gives her friend.

Immortal artist of a work supreme!

Delighted Rome beheld with proud esteem,

'Her own bright ima'ge, of Colossal size,

From thy long toils in purest marble rise.

But envious time, with a malignant stroke,

This sacred statue into fragments broke;

In Lethe's stream its nobler portions sunk> x

And left futurity the wounded trunk.

Yet, like the matchless, mutilated framei .

To which great Angelo bequeath'd his name.

This glorious ruin, in whose strength we find

The splendid vigour of the sculptor's mind;

In the fond eye of admiration still,

Rivals the finish'd forms of modern skill. ^
