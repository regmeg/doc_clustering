CHAP. 52. ROMAN HISTORY. 479

'Veil? Add to all this, mindful as it were, of our ancient

'religious institutions, we have both brought foreign

* gods to Rome, and also established new ones. Juno,

* queen of the gods, was lately brought from Veii; and

* how conspicuous was the day of her dedication render-  
"ed, by the meritorious zeal of the ladies? We have

* ordered a temple to be erected to Aius Locutius, on ac-  
'count of the miraculous voice heard in the New Street.

'To other solemnities, we have added the Capitoiine

* games: and by authority of the senate have establish-

* ed a new college for that purpose: What occasion had  
'we for all this work, if we had been determined to

'leave the city at the same time with the Gauls? if our

'stay in the capitol, during a siege of so many months,

'was not voluntary? If it was not fear that kept us

'back from the enemy?

'But do I only mention rites and temples, and leave

'the priests entirely out of the question? Do you not

* perceive how much we shall have to account for with  
'respect to them! The vestals are fixed to one parti-

'cular residence,-from which, no consideration but the

'capture of the city, ever moved them. The priest of

'Jupiter, without the grossest criminality, dare not sleep

* one night out of the city. Would you make them  
'Vejentian, instead of Roman priests? And, O Vesta,

* shall any vestals forsake thee now? And will the priest

* of Jupiter, by residing among strangers, involve in so

* much guilt, himself and his country every night?

* Need I mention other things, which are performed by  
'auspices, generally within the pomcerium; must they

'too be forgotten or neglected? The comitia by curiae,

'who have the cognizance of military affairs; the co-

'mitia by centuries, by whom our consuls and military

* tribunes are elected, can they be held any where un-  
'der proper auspices, but in the usual place? Shall we

* transfer them to Veii? Or, shall the people, under a  
'thousand Inconveniences, meet in a city abandoned

* by gods and men?
