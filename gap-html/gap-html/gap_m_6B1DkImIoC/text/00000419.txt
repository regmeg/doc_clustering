CHAP. VII.

The works of Veii in flames ;— repaired by the Romans. —

Extraordinary unanimity between the Orders.

was already a match for the tribunes in their

own assemblies, when the news of a loss at Veii, which

nobody could have dreamed, would have produced such

an effect, all at once turned the scale entirely in his fa­

vour, cemented more strongly the orders of the state, and

inspired them with new ardour for pushing the siege

with more vigour.than ever. .

For when they had raised a mount * near the town

and had only to fix the galleries to the walls; as the

Romans were more intent on carrying on their works by

day, than guarding them in the night, a port was open­

ed all of a sudden, whence multitudes sallied out armed

with lighted torches, and set fire to the works. In an in­

stant, these works, which had taken so long a time in the

construction, were all in flames; and numbers, who en­

deavoured to extinguish them, lost their labour, and their

lives into the bargain, either by the fire, or the sword.

* The Agger was made of fascines, stones and earth, composed  
of balisteri crossing each other in form of a Lattice; its height

was shun of the watls, as it had wooden towers upon it, overtop­

pins them.
