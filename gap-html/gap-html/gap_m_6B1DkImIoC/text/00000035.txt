What gave occasion to this number among the Etruri­

ans, was the number of nations of which they consisted,

each having a vote in the election of a king, to whom

also each of them assigned a Lictor.

In the mean time, the walls of the city were extended,

by including one place after another within their works;

which they carried on more in hopes of an accession of

inhabitants, than for the accommodation of the numbers

they had at present. Thereafter, that this speculation

might not be aerial, Romulus, in order to increase his

numbers, adopting the policy of those ancient founders,

who by drawing togetlier an assemblage of people in low

circumstances, and of mean extraction, pretended that

men arose to them out of the earth, opened an asylum

in that place, which is now enclosed, as you go down

the hill between the two groves: thither, freed men

and .slaves, and whoever had a taste for novelty, fled in

multitudes without distinction, from the neighbouring

nations, which was the first accession to their infant

power, -

As they were now become a pretty formidable party,

the next step was to put them under some proper regu­

lation. For this purpose, an hundred Senators were

chosen; either because that number was thought suffi­

cient, or because no more were found, who could with

propriety be elected. But it was surely out of respect/

that they were called Fathers, and their children Pa^

tricians. s-~~
