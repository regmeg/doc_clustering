and the more they were pressed by the enemy, they were

obliged to contract their own circle in proportion; which

at once discovered their weakness, and the enemy's vast

the expedition against the Volsci. So close to the walls

of Rome was this war brought, that the first battle was

fought at the temple of Hope, with no advantage on
