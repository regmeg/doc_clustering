Chap. 39. ROMAN HISTORY. 73

disappeared with the child's sleep. Then Tanaquil tak­

ing her husband aside, "See you that child," said she,

"whom we educate so meanly; Let me tell you, he will

"one day be a light to us in our distress, and a protec-

"tion to our house, when we need it most. Let jis,

"therefore, from this moment, train up this youth with

"the-utmost care, for whom, in a public as well as pri-

"vate capacity, great honours are reserved."

From that moment he was treated as their own, and

instructed in every science, calculated to excite men of

spirit to aim at high fortune. What Heaven is pleased

to countenance, requires little cultivation from man. Ser-

vius soon discovered a princely disposition; and when,

they looked about for a son-in-law to the king, was there

one among all the Roman youth, who could in any qua­

lification, bear a comparison with him. The king there­

fore gave him his daughter in marriage.1" ': ' -;

Whatever it was that raised him to this honouraMe

distinction, it certainly discredits the conjecture, that he

was either born of a ^lave, or that he himself, when a

child, had ever been in the servile line. I am rather -f

their opinion, who think, that after the capture ofOr-

uicolum, the wife of Servius Tullius, who had been a

grandee in that city, was left pregnant, when her hus­

band was killed; and that when she came to be knawn

among the rest of the prisoners, in consideration »fher

rank, was rescued from slavery by the Roman- queen,

and was delivered at Rome in the royal palace.-—That

the child, having been brought up at court, from his in­

fancy, had been much caressed and- esteemed there;' an

extraordinary friendship between the ladies having taken

place upon so signal an indulgence; and that the mo­

ther's estate, which, after her country, was taken, became

the perquisite of the conquerors," gave rise to the surmise

that he was the son of a slave.
