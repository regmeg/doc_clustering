CHAP. 6. ROMAN HISTORY. 211

der the pressure of these calamities, advices all of a sud­

den were brought from the Hernici, that the confederate

forces of the /Lqui and Hernici had encamped in their

country, and were proceeding with a huge army to pil­

lage their lands. A thin senate easily discovered to the

allies, how much the city had been reduced by the plague,

and, besides, carried back this uncomfortabte answer:

That the Hernici, in conjunction with the Latins, must

for this time depend entirely upon their own internal

resources, for the anger of the gods had depopulated

Rome by a sudden plague. Should the rage of the

pestilence subside, they would not be wanting to give

their allies the assistance they had afforded them last

year, and on other occasions." Upon this they de­

parted more disconsolate than they had set out; for they

could not of themselves support a war, which they could

only maintain with difficulty, sustained by the Roman

ensigns.

The enemy did not make a long stay in the country

of the Hernici, but marched in a hostile manner into the

territories of Rome, which were desolate enough without

the calamities of war. Meeting nobody with or with­

out arms, and finding every thing defenceless and even

uncultivated, they penetrated by the Gabinian way,

within three miles of Rome. /Ebutius, one of the con­

suls was dead; Servilius his colleague was scarce alive,

and most of the nobility were affected, as were the great­

er part of the fathers, and also every one else fit to bear

arms; insomuch, that so far from having forces to stem.

the torrent of the war, with which they were threatened

at present, they had not a sufficient number of guards

for common duty. The senators, whose age and health

permitted them, mounted guard in person, and stood

sentry. The .ffidiles went the rounds and gave orders:

For on them the administration of government, together

with the consular authority, had totally devolved.
