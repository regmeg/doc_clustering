&8 TITUS LIVIUS' BOOK I.

This young nobleman, when he understood that the

principal of the Roman nobility, and among the rest

his own brother, had been butchered by his uncle, he

resolved that nothing should appear in his spirit to alarm

the fears, and nothing in his fortune to tempt the rapa­

city of the king; imagining he would be safer under the

cloak of contempt, than in the protection of the laws.

Wherefore, designedly assuming the air and habits of a

fool, he suffered himself and all his fortune to fall into

the hands of the king, and very cheerfully took the sir-

name of Brutus; that his extraordinary abilities, con­

cealed under this title of reproach, might watt for the

proper season to appear with redoubled lustre, in assert­

ing the liberty of Rome.

When at that time he accompanied the Tarqnins to

Delphi, rather as their buffoon, than companion, it is'

reported of him, that he carried with him a rod of gold,

enclosed in a case of elder, which gave it the appearance

of a common stick, as a present to Apollo.—This was a

true emblem of his own mind and external appearance.

When they had finished their journey, and executed

their father's commands, they were prompted by their

curiosity to enquire of the oracle, which of them should

succeed him in the kingdom. Upon which, it is said,

a voice from the bottom of the cave made the following

response: " Whoever of you, gentlemen, shall first

"have the good fortune to give a kiss to his mother,

"shall be ruler at Rome." The Tarquins, as Sextus

their brother had been left at Rome, and consequently

ignorant of the oracle's answer, that he should have no

share in the government, order that all should be kept

secret and determined by lot, which of them two, upon

their return to Rome, should first kiss his mother Tullia.

But Brutus concluding that the oracle's mean:ng was

very different, pretended to fall down by chance, and

kissed the earth, the common mother of all living. Af­

ter this they all returned to Rome, where they found

the city in a commotion, on account of the preparations

for a.war against the Rutuli.
