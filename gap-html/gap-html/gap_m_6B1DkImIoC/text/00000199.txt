not the whole assembly, highly incensed at the beha­

viour of Appius, taken part with their tribune against the

consul, great numbers of their body, upon the alarm,

flocking thither from all parts of the city. Appius, how­

deliberated, the more they saw the folly of continuing

these contests; insomuch, that Quinctius had the thanks

of the house for interfering so seasonably, to suspend the

daemon of discord. On the other hand, they conjured

Appius, " Not to carry his zeal for the dignity of the con-

"sulship, beyond what was consistent with the peace

"and harmony of the state. That whilst the consuls

"and tribunes were dragging every thing to themselves,

"the state was left naked and impotent between them,

"each side seeming less intent upon its safety, than

"upon making themselves its masters."

On the other hand, Appius " called gods and men to/

•' witness, that they abandoned and betrayed the com-

"monwealth, through mere pusillanimity.—That the
