CHAP. i. ROMAN HISTORY. 15

In the study of history there is this peculiar advantage:

There you have examples of every kind set before you,

in a conspicuous point of view; whence you may set up

models for your imitation, as an individual or a state,

or beacons to warn you against base attempts, which.

end in disgrace. But either I am prepossessed in favour

of the work I have undertaken, or there never was a

state more respectable for its greatness, its sanctity, or

variety of excellent characters. Never was there a state,

into which luxury and avarice found their way so late,

nor where poverty and frugality were held so long and

so much in repute, that the less they had, the less they

desired. Of late years, riches have introduced luxury,

and a profusion of pleasures, a taste for extravagance in

ail the ways of riot and debauchery: but as complaints

will not even then be agreeable, when perhaps they are

necessary, let us at least drop them in the introduction

to so great a work, or rather, were it fashionable with

us histdrians, as it is with the poets, set out with more

enlivening ideas, with good omens, and vows, and

prayers to the gods and goddesses, that they would

vouchsafe to-grant success, adequate to the greatness of

the undertaking.

having run through many adventures, arrived in the

interior bay of the Adriatic sea, with a body of Heneti,

who having, for seditious practices, been expelled
