'of you return one denier the richer from these assem-

'blies? What did you ever carry home to your wives

« and children from these assemblies? Yes; I can tell

« you. Haired, disgust, and animosity, public and pri-

'vate; from the fatal effects of which, you have indeed

'been preserved, not by your own integrity nor bravery,

* but by the assistance of others. Why, wben you

* fought in the field, under us consuls, and not in the

• forum under your tribunes; when your shouts in battle

« terrified your enemies, and not the Roman Patrictans

« in your assemblies; it was then you got booty, it was

* then you took lands from your enemies, it was then  
« you acquired riches and glory to yourselves and the

* with one another like so many fish-wives, satisfied  
'completely with your present peace, and never reflect-

• ing, that that very peace would soon bring war upon

* you from every quarter.

• I am sensible, 1 might fall upon a thousand topics,

4 that would please you better than the present, and be

* more agreeable to my own natural turn of mind: but

• necessity at.present rather obliges me to speak truth,

• than flatter you to your ruin. I would wish, O Romans,

• to give you ^pleasure;—but to give you happiness,

• however you may be disposed with respect to me, is

• my more ardent wish. Our nattiral temper is such,

'that we listen more willingly to him who flatters us

• for his own interest, than to the man who has no earih-

• \y view, but the good of the community. You ima-

* gine, perhaps, that those flatterers, those worshippers
