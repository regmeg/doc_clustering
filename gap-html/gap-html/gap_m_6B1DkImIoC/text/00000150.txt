CHAP. XXVI.

The Sabincs and Arunci defeated.

IMMEDIATELY after this, a war with the Sabines

menaced Rome, but it was father a tumult than a war.

The city was alarmed in the night, with an account, that

the Sabine army was ravaging the country, and had ad­

vanced as far as the Anio, plundering and burning all

the (arm-houses in their «ay. A. Posthufnius, who had

been dictator in the war with the Latins, was immedi­

ately sent against them with the cavalry, and the consul

Servilius followed him with a select body of infantry.

Most of the stragglers were cut oil' by the horse, and the

resistance the Sabine legions made against the foot, when

they came up with them, was not vigorous. Exhausted

with their march, and plundering the country in the

night, and many of them overcharged with eating and

drinking in .the houses as they had come along, had not

strength enough Heft to carry them away.

The war with the Sabmes being begun and ended the

same night, the next day, when the Romans thought

they had now secured peace with all their neighbours,

• he ambassadors of the Arunci came to the senate,

threatening them with an immediate declaration of war,

if they did not withdraw their troops from the territory

of the Volsci. At the same time that the couriers took

their departure for Rome, the army of the Arunci began

their march, The report that it was seen near Aricia,

occasioned such hurry and confusion at Rome, that the

senate could not be properly consulted, and whilst they

were arming themselves, they could not give a deliberate

answer to those who had laid them uuder that necessity.

They immediately march for Aricta with a hostile army,

nor was it far from thence, that they came' up with the-

Arunci, whom they discussed in one battle.
