120 TITUS LIVIUS' BOOK II.

"enemy to pass, they would soon sec more of them in

"the Palatium and capitol, than in the Janiculum; and,

"for that reason, he advised and charged them to de-

"molish the bridge by the axe, by fire, or by any other

"means of destruction in their power, that, in the mean

"time, he would singly sustain the enemy's attack, with

"all the vigour he was master of."

He then advanced to the entrance of the bridge, and

being easily distinguished among those who had turned

their backs and fled, facing about to engage with the

enemy, hand to hand, by that surprising instance of

gallantry, he confounded the Etrurians. Two, however,

Spurius Lartius, and Titus Herminius, men eminent for

their birth and noble actions, were ashamed to leave him

with them: for a short time, he stood the first shock of

danger, and the most disorderly part of the assault; and

at last, upon a call from those who were employed in

catting down the bridge, he'obliged his companions to

retire, upon the little that remained. Then looking fierce­

ly at the Etrurian officers, and with a threatening air, he

challenged them,one by one, and upbraided them all;

telling them, "That they were the slaves of haughty

"tyrants, who, regardless of their own liberty, came to

"wrest it from their neighbours."

They hesitated for some time, and looked at one ano­

ther, who should step out to begin the attack; shame at

length put the army in motion, who setting up a shout

threw their javelins from every quarter at a single ene­

my; all which, when he received on his shield, and stood

firm and undaunted,* to keep possession of the bridge,

they endeavoured to justle him off by force; when the

crash of the bridge, that was now broke down, and the

shouts of the Romans, rejoicing that it was done, stunned

them with the shock, and suspended their fury. Then

Cocles, " O father, Tiberinus," says he, "earnestly do

"I pray, that thou wouldst receive these arms and this

"soldier, and that thy streams would be merciful."

Wherefore he threw himself into the Tiber, armed as

lie was, and amidst ten thousand darts, that fell about

him, he swimmed across the river to his own party, with-

* Ingcns gradus, stately step.
