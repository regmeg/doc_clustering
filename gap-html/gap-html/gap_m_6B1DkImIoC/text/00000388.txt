980 BOOK IV. TITUS LIVIUS'

Appius, who was created decemvir for compiling a body

of laws, at this time the youngest of all the senators,

represented, as it is related of him, ' That he would lay

before them an old political maxim, hereditary in his

family, which his great grandfather Appius Claudius,
