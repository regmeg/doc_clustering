CHAP. I.

War with the Vejentes, A. R. 350.

HILST all around were in peace, the Romans and

Vejentes were at war, which they prosecuted with such

a spirit of hatred and revenge,. that it appeared the war

must terminate in the dissolution of the conquered. The

assemblies for the election of magistrates in these two

states, acted upon principles entirely different. The

Romans increased the number of their military tribunes,

eight being elected this year, which never happened be­

fore; namely, Manius jEmilius Mamercinus, a second

time, L. Valerius Potitus, a third time, Ap. Claudius

Crassus, M. Quinctilius, L. Julius Julus, M. Posthumius,

M. Camillas, M. Posthumius Albinus.* The Vejentes,

on the contrary, tired out with the annual intrigues about

elections, which .sometimes laid the foundation of civil

broils, chose a king to rule over them.

'•-- The two last were censors, not military tribunes, according

to the Capitoline marbles.
