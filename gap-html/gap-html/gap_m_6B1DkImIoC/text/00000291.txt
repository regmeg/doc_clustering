injury, is liable to the pains of law. For which reason,

an ^Edile may be arrested and imprisoned by a superior

magistrate; which, though not expressly warranted by

Virginius was pitched on as the first prosecutor, and

Appius, in course was the defendant. When the day

/or Appius's trial was come, he stept into the forum,

escorted by a band of young Patricians, which gave

every one a retrospect of those melancholy days, when

the same Patricians, like so many guards, made up his

train.

Virginius then addressed himself to the people, to the
