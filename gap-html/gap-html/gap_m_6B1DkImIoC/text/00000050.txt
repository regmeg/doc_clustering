42 TITUS LIVIUS' BOOK. I.

Upon hearing the name of Numa mentioned, the Roman

fathers, although they saw that the balance of power

would be in favour of the Sabines, should they take a

king of that nation; yet none of them had the assurance

to put himself or any of his party, or in fine; any ol the

senators or citizens in competition with him, so that to a
