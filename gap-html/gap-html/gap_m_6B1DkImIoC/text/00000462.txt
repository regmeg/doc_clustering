sorrow; but when they were advised of the enemy's ap­

proach, public fear soon suppressed all p-t8Bc concern.

It was not long before they heard the barbarians roaring

out their howlings and discordant notes, as they strolled

in troops round the city walls. During all the time after,

till next morning, they were in the utmost suspense,

every moment expecting an attack would be made upon

the city, after the first approach of the enemy to it: as it

was highly probable, they would not have stirred from

Allia, but with that intention. At sun-set, as little light

then remained, they were fully persuaded, that they

would take the advantage of the little they had before

the night came on, and when all was quiet during the

evening, that they had deferred their design to strike the

greater terror during the darkness of the night. At last

the approach of day doubled their panic, which kept

pace in progression with the evil itself, till they saw the

enemy's ensigns enter their gates. However, during

that night, and the day following, the citizens acted with

much greater propriety than the army had done at Allia.

For, when they found that to defend the city, with so

small a force as had been left in it, would be quite im­

arms, and the flower of the senate, with their wives and

children, should retire into the citadel and capitol; and

having carried arms and provisions thither, defend their

gods, their fellow-citizens, and the Rornan name, from

these strong-holds;whilst the priests of Romulus and the

vestals carried off the sacred things, and placed them out

of the reach of fire and sword, being firmly resolved ne­

ver to give over the worship of the godsi whilst a single

soul remained to perform it. For they thought, that if

the citadel and capitol, the august body of the gods,

the senate that formed the public council of the state,

and the youth of age to bear arms, survived the ruin

that impended the city, the loss of the old men, an use­

less number left in the city, and who in course of nature

would die at any rate, was not much to be regretted.

To encourage those of inferior rank to acquiesce in this

resolution, without murmuring, the superannuate consu­

lar and triumphant generals declared publicly, that they

would die with, them; for, since their bodies were too

weak to support the weight of arms, for the defence of
