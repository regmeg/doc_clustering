obsolete, are founded the forms used in elections, and

passing bills even at this day. For, before a, single vote

were so widely different?

I am rather of opinion, that Numa owed his extra­

ordinary qualifications to the force of his own natura-I

genius; and that he was not so remarkable for the ac­

quisition of foreign knowledge, as he was a perfect mas<-

ter in the severe and rigid discipline of the Sabines, for­

merly in very high repute for its strictness and purity,
