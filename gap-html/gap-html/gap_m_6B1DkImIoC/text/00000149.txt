Defeat of the Volsci.

\. HE next night the Volsci, confidmg in the differ­

ences that subsisted among the Romans, made au attempt

upon their camp, expecting to find some under cover of

the night, who would either desert to them, or betray

the rest. They were discovered by the guard, an alarm

spread, and upon a signal given, they ran to arms. Thus

were the Volsci disappointed in their design; and both

parties, for the remainder of that night, continued quiet.

Next morning early, the Volsci having filled up the

ditches, made an attack upon the rampart. Already

had they begun to break down the pallisadoes op all

sides, but the consul, willing to try the mettle of his sol­

diers, delayed coming to action for some time, although

the soldiers from every quarter, especially the debtors,

cried out to him to give the signal. But now, convinced

of their ardour, he at length gave the word of command,

and the soldiers eager to attack, made a general sally

from every gate of the camp.

The enemy unable to stand so vigorous a charge, were

put to flight; the foot pursued, and put all to the sword

they could overtake. The rest'were driven in great con­

sternation by the horse to their camp, which was imme­

diately invested by the legions, soon after deserted by

the Volsci in a panic, and taken and plundered by the

soldiers.

The enemy fled to Suessa Pometia, whither the Ro­

man legions pursued them, the day after. In a few

days tlie city was taken, and given to be plundered by

the soldiers, which was some relief in their present dis­

tress. The consul marched back his victorious army to

Rome, with the greatest glory. When he was applied

to by the deputies of the Ecetrans, who were a part of

the Volsci, and after Pometia was taken, were afraid for

themselves, the senate, by their decree, granted them

peace, but their lauds were taken from them.
