86 TITUS LIVIUS' BOOK I.

him out of the senate-house, threw him from the top to

the bottom of the stairs, and (hen returned to hold the

senate. The king's officers and attendants made the best

of their way. He himself quite faint, was returning

home, supported by a small retinue, half dead with fear,

and had got to the top of the Cyprian street, when he

was overtaken and slain by a party sent out by Tarquin

for that purpose.

This happened, it is thought by Tullia's advice; as she

had been deeply concerned in all the other villainous

plots: One thing however is certain, that she drove in

her chariot, and without minding the crowd about her,

she called her husband out of the senate-house, and was

the first to salute him king; and being ordered by him

to retire out of the crowd, on her way home, when she

had reached the upper part of the Cyprian street, where

lately stood a temple of Diana, as she was wheeling to

the right, towards the Virbian ascent, which was the way

to the Esquiline hill, the charioteer, struck with horror,

checked his horses, and made a stop, pointing to the bo­

dy of Servius, which lay murdered in the street.

Cruel and inhuman is the action that is said to have

followed upon this; of which the place itself exhibits a

proof: they call it the wicked street, in which Tullia,

racked and tortured with the furies of her husband and

sister, is reported, in a fit of madness, to have driven her

chariot over the body of her father, and to have carried

home on her clothes and chariot, part of his blood, to her

own house gods, and those of her husband; who being

justly provoked at the barbarity of the action, brought

their. usurpation speedily to an end suited to the wicked­

ness of its beginning.

The reign of Tullius had been so glorious forforty-five

years, that it would have been hard even for a good

prince, a reasonable king, to have filled his place with

equal dignity.—This too adds to the glory of his reign'

that the just and legal exercise of the royal prerogative

fell at the same time with him. Some authors are of opi­

nion, that he had it in view to have resigned his power,

however mild and moderate the exercise of it had been,

because it was absolute, had not the intrigues of his own

family cut short his plan of fixing his country's liberty.
