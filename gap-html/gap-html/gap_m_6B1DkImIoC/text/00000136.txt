123 TITUS LIVIUS' BOOK II.

honourable of that order were commissioned for the purÂ­

pose; telling him, " That the answer to his embassy

"might have been very short; that monarchy would

"never be re-established at Rome, but they rather chose

"to depute the most illustrious of their body to himself,

"than give that answer to his ambassadors at Home.

"But that the affair of the Tarquins might be for ever

"buried in oblivion, and no anxiety arise on that score,

"to interrupt the perfect union and amicable footing

"they were on at present, by making a requisition, en-

"tirely inconsistent with the liberty of the Roman peo-

"pie, and putting them under the disagreeable necessity

"of refusing him a request, to whom they would wish

"to be ail compliance, or subscribing voluntarily to their

"own destruction. That the Roman people were not

"uow under the government of kings; their motto was

"Liberty, and they were resolved to open their gates to

"any of their enemies, sooner than to kings; nay, there

"was not a citizen of Rome, but was firmly determined,

"that the existence of '.heir liberty, and that of the city

"should have the same period. Wherefore, they ear-

"nestly intreated, if he wished them well, he would per-

"mit them to be free."

Overcome by the modesty of their arguments, the

king answered; " Since you are so irrevocably fixed

"and determined, I will give you no farther trouble, by

"repeating the same request to no purpose; nor will I

"amuse the Tarquins with the hopes of assistance I am

"not disposed to give: but whether they choose to live

"at peace, or have recourse to war, they must find some

"other retreat in their exile, that nothing may interrupt

"the peace subsisting between you and me." To these

expressions of friendship he ad'ded very signal acts of

generosity: For he restored the hostages that had been

left with him, and the lands of the Vejentes, ceded to

him by the treaty of Janiculum. Tarquin despairing

now of a possibility of being re-established, retired to

Mamilius Octavius, his son-in-law, at Tusculum. Thus

Was the peace with Porsenna inviolably observed.
