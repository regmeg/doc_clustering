CHAP. 55. ROMAN HISTORY. 391

Sortie time after, fortune inclining to the side of the

people, expresses arrived with the accounts that the sol­

diers yjio kept garrison in the fortress ot Carventum,

having gone out on a foraging match, the jEqui had

surprised the'fort, and put the tew who were left for its

defence to the sword. That the rest of the soldiers, either

as they returned, and were entering the fort again, or

as thev were found straggling in the country, had met

witti the same fate. This affair, prejudicial as it was to

the state, strengthened the hands of the tribunes in the

present dispute. For, it was to no purpose that they

had been solicited to obstruct the levies no longer, now

that matters were come to this extremity; wherefore, as

they still continued inflexible, notwithstanding the sierm

which threatened the state, and the odium they were

like to bring on themselves, the senate was obtiged to

pass an act for the election of military tribunes, but with

this express provision, that none of those who acted in

the capacity of tribune of the people for this year, should

be elected, nor be re-elected to the office of tribune for

the succeeding year.

Without all doubt, the senate had the Icilii in their

eye, whom they accused of aspiring to a consular office,

as a reward of the seditious use they made of their

tribunitian power. Then the levies were made, and

preparations for war carried on, with the universal con­

sent of all ranks. Whether both consuls marched to re­

take the fortress of Carventum, or one of them staid in

the city to preside at the election, is a question about

which authors are not agreed. But, it is abundantly

certain, nor has it been contradicted, that the Roman ar­

my, after they had spent a long time before Carventum,

raised the siege, and went against Verrugo, a city of the

Volsci, which they reduced, and by ravaging the terri­

tories of the /E(jui and Volsci, made a considerable

booty.
