'then, my fellow-citizens, abandon al! these gods, both

'public and private? How very different does this

'scheme of yours appear, from what was acted by the

'noble youth, C. Fabius, to the admiration of the ene-

'my as well as yours, who came down from the citadel,

• amidst the darts of the enemy, and performed a reli-

'gious ceremony upon the Quirinal hill, peculiar to

'the Fabian family? Is it criminal in a private family

'Now, was it an act of devotion to bring religious

• and shall we, without involving ourselves in the guilt

'of sacrilege, carry them hence to Veii, a hostile city?

'Will you only call to mind, how often our sacred ce-
