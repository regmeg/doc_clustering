CHAP. 3. ROMAN HISTORY. 315

'latter had before them ! Do you imagine we are so ig-

* norant of our own history, that we never heard that

* Numa Pompilius, who was neither a Patrician, nor  
'even a Roman citizen, was called from his farm in the

* country of the Sabines, and by order of the people,

* and the authority of the fathers, made king of Rome?  
« —That, thereafter, L. Tarquinius, by birth so far from

'being a Roman, that he was not even an Italian, the

* son of Demaratus of Corinth, a temporary citizen of  
'Tarquinii, was nevertheless, in the life-time of Ancus'*

'children, placed upon the throne? That Servius Tullius

'after him, the son of.a captive woman of Corniculum,

'whose father no mortal knew, whose mother was a

* slave, attained the sovereignty, by his excellent quali-  
'ties and extraordinary merit. Why should I mention

* Titus Tatius the Sabine, whom Romulus, the founder

* against foreigners who had merit to recommend them,.  
'even since the extinction of regal power. Have we

'not since that time, received the family of the Claudii

'among us, from the country of the Sabines, and not

'only admitted them to the freedom of the city, but also

'into the order of the Patricians? Shall a foreigner be-

* come a Patrician, and afterwards consul, and a Roman.

* citizen be excluded the consulship, because he is aPle-

* beian? Do we believe then, in the name of wonder, that

* it is impossible for the people to produce a man of

* merit and courage, qualified to discharge the duties of

* the cabinet and the field, resembling ISfuma, Tarquin,

* and Servius? And if one of this character happen to

* be born among us, .shall we never suffer him to ap-

* proach the helm of state! Shall we rather choose to

* have men for consuls of the complexion of decemvirs,

* the most wicked of mankind, and all of them Patricians,.

* rather than men resembling the best of our kings, wha  
'could not boast of their high descent I
