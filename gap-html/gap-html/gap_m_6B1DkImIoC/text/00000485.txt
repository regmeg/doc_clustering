Camillus prevails.

V-/AMILLUS's arguments, in general, but especially

those drawn from religion, are allowed to have left a

very strong impression with the people; but a chance

word, seasonably spoken, determined them entirely. For

some moments after, when the senate had met in the

Curia Hostilia, to deliberate on these things, the cohorts,

as they were returning from guard, passed in a body

through the forum, and a centurion called out in the co-

mitium, 'Ensign, plant your colours, we shall be very welt

'here:' upon which, the senators ran out of the temple,

crying, We .accept the omen. The multitude standing

around, unanimously approved the motion.

The law being afterwards rejected, they began to

build the city, without forming a plan, or regarding pro­

perty. The public supplied them with tiles, and per­

mitted them to take stones or other materials, wherever

they found it convenient; exacting security, however,

from every one, that his house should be finished in

twelve months. The hurry they were in prevented them

from paying the least regard to regularity in the streets:

For every man, without minding property, laid the foun­

dation of his house in the first empty place that occur­

red; for which reason, the old sewers, which had origi­

nally run through the streets, now ran everywhere un­

der the houses; and the city had more the appearance

of being populous, than of being regularly disposed.

FINIS.
