may fortune be with you;—may your success be

adequate to the generosity of your undertaking. Then

may you look for consulships,—triumphs,—all the re*-

Wards, alt the honours, it is in the power of your

country to bestow." Passing by the capitol, citadel,

and other temples, every body implored all the gods that

occurred to their eyes, or imagination, to favour theif

departure and undertaking, and to grant them a speedy

and happy return to their country and parents. But

these prayers were not heard.

Marching out by an unlucky way, through the right

arch of the gate Carrnentalis, they arrived at the river

Cremera, where they judged it would be proper to raise

works and leave a garrison for their defence,* Lucius

."Emilius, and C. Servilius, were at that time chosen

consuls.

Whilst nothing was studied on either side but plun­

dering and reprisals, the Fabii found themselves suffi­

cient to protect the Roman territory; and by detaching

flying parties through all the country, where the Tuscau

territory borders upon that of Rome* protected their own

frontiers, and became very troublesome to that of the

"hnemy. But these devastations were cut short:. For, to

enable die enemy to carry the works at Cremeraj they

sent for an army .out of Etruria. L. Emilius the consul,

in the mean time, coming up with the Roman legions,

immediately attacked them. The Vejentes had no time

for battle arrangement; insomuch, that in the first hurry

and confusion, whilst theywere drawing up in form,

and posting a corps-de-reserve, a wing of the Roman

cavalry charged them so suddenly in flank, that they

had neither room to form their lines, nor make an attack.

They were consequently routed: and retreating to the

Red Rocks, where they had their camp, humbly sued

For peace. That they obtained; but from the natural

levity of their tempers, before the Roman garrison was

.withdrawn from Creraerai tliey were qaite of another

mind.
