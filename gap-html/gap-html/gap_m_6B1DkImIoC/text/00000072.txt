64 TITUS LIVIUS' BOOK 1.

"you to witness, (naming the people, whoever they

"are,) that this is an unjust people, who act not agree-

"ably to the principles of equity. But we will consult

"the fathers in our own country, how we may best

"compel them to make restitution."

Upon this he returns to Rome for advice; when the

king lays the matter before the senate, in words, nearly

as follows: " Concerning such matters, disputes, and

quarrels, as the Pater Patratus of the Roman people,

hath declared to the Pater Patratus of the ancient La­

tins} and such things, as ought by the ancient Latins

'to have been yielded, granted, and done; and the

'which, by them, have not been yielded, granted, nor

'done. Say," continued he, addressing himself to the

person whose opinion he first asked ; " give me your opi-

"nion. I think, (returned the other,) that they should

"be compelled to make restitution, by fair and open

"war; for this I declare myself, and give my vote ac-

"cordingly."—Then the vote went round in order.

When the majority present declared themselves of the

same opinion, war was then said to have been unani­

mously determined on; when the herald, bearing a lance

headed with iron, or dipped in blood, and burnt at the

end, went to the confines of the offending power, and in

the presence of three witnesses, each at least fourteen

years of age, cried out, " Because of the injuries done

"to, and committed on the people of Rome, by the peo-

"pie of the ancient Latins, and the ancient Latin men.

"Because the people of Rome have' commanded that

"war should be made upon the Latins; and the senate

"of the people of Rome hath voted, agreed, and deter-

"mined, that war should be denounced against the an-

"cient Latins; I and the people of Rome do hereby war

"proclaim, denounce, and make upon the people of the

"ancient Latins, and ancient Latin men:" and with

these words, he darted a lance against the enemies lands.

—This then was the mode of demanding restitution, and

proclaiming war against the Latins, which posterity have

'ever after adopted.
