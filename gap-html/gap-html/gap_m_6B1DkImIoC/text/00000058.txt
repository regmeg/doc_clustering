50 TITUS LIVIUS' , BOOK I.

This treaty was ratified in the following form; and it

is surely the most ancient record in history. A herald

put the question to king Tullus, "Is it your pleasure, O

"King, that I enter mto a treaty with the Pater Patra-

"tus of the people of Alba?" The king answering in

the affirmative; "Give me then vervain, O king," con­

tinued he; " take it up pure," rejoined the king; the

herald took up a pile or' pare grass from the temple, and

then put this second question; " Do you, O kmg, consti-

"tute me the royal ambassador of the Roman people?

"Do you appoint me an equipage and a retinue?" To

which the king made answer, " Whatever I can do with-

"out prejudice to myself, or the Roman people, that I

"do." The herald was Marcus Valerius, who nomi­

nated Spurius Fusius, the pater patratus touching his

head and hair with vervain.

It is the business of the pater patratus to administer

the oath, by which the treaty is ratified, and this he does

in along form of words too tedious to mention: the se­

veral clauses and conditions being all read over; " Hear,

"O Jupiter," says he, " give ear, O pater patratus of

"the Alban people; and ye, O people of Alba, hear

"that the Romans shall not be the first to depart from

"these conditions, which, out of these waxed tables,

"without fraud or equivocation, have, from first to last,

"been read over in your hearing, in the real accepta-

"tation in which they are this day taken and under-

"stood. And if, by public authority or fraudulent de-

"sign, they should be the first to break through these

"conditions, may thou, O Jupiter, that moment so strike

"the Roman people, as here, this day, I strike this hog;

"and may thy stroke, great Jupiter, be as much heavier,

"as thy power is greater."—Having thus spoke, he struck

the hog dead with a flmt. The Albans took their own

oath, and went through their own forms, with their own

dictator and priests.
