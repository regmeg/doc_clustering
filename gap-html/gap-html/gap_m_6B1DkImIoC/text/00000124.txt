116 TITUS LIVIUS' BOOK II.

was a plain acknowledgment, that the majesty and

power of the' people, was paramount to that of the con­

sul. When they were called to silence, the consul

"highly extolled the good fortune of his colleague who

"after the delivery of his country had fallen in the

"greatest honour, fighting for its liberty, when his glory

"was at its height, and before it was sullied by the foul

"touches of envy: whilst himself had survived the glory

"he had acquired, to become the but of envy and cri-

"minal impeachments, and from being esteemed the

"deliverer of his country, had his character now level-

"led with that of the Vitellii and Aquilei. Shall there

"never be a time," says'he, " that virtue will be so fully

"approved by you, as to be proof against jealousy? Is

"it possible, that I, who have shown myself an implac­

able enemy to kings, should have reason to fear, that

ever a charge of aspiring to regal power, would be

laid against myself? Were I to live in the capitd,

nay, in the citadel itself, could I ever imagine, that I

should become formidable to my fellow citizens? Does

my character among you depend on circumstances so

trifling? Is your confidence in me so slightly founded,

that you should rather be concerned about the situa­

tion of my house, than the conduct of my life? But,

gentlemen, the house of Publius Valerius shall never

obstruct your liberty. No longer be afraid of Velia.

I will not only bring down my house into the plain,

but even build it at the foot of the hill, that you may

dwell above me, a suspected citizen. Permit those to

build upon Velia, whom you think more worthy to be

entrusted with your liberty, than Publius Valerius."

All the materials were accordingly brought down to

the valley below Velia, and his house was built at

the foot of the hill, where the temple of Victory now

stands.
