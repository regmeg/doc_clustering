PREFACE.

the speeches, than could have been done by way of set and

formal arguments.

I think the English reader can want nothing more, to en­

able him to read Thucydides with pleasure and profit ; es­

pecially if he be at all acquainted with the Grecian history,

of which few that ever read can now be ignorant, since Mr-

Stanyan's History of Greece and the Universal History are

in so many hands. I dismiss the work with some hope, but

more terror about its success. That hope is encouraged and

supported by the list of my Subscribers. There are Names

that do me honour indeed; and which, whether the work

may suit the generality or not, will preserve me from ever

repenting that I have bestowed so much time on translating

THUCYDIDES.
