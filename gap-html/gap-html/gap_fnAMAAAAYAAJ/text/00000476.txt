he left behind him a strong presumption, that the rest of his

countrymen are like himself*.

So soon therefore as it was known at Athens, that he

was arrived to take upon him the conduct of affairs in

Thrace, the Athenians declare Perdiccas their enemy, as­

cribing this expedition to his cabals, and by strengthening

their garrisons kept a strict watch over all their dependants

in that quarter.

advanced with his army, and in conjunction with Brasidas,

to the entrance of Lyncus, Brasidas communicated his in­

the points in dispute to the arbitration of Brasidas. The

Chalcidean embassadors also, who followed the camp, were

continually suggesting to him, that, " he ought not to plunge

" himself rashly into difficulties for the sake of Perdiccas,"

designing to reserve him more intire for their own service.

And besides this, the ministers of Perdiccas had declared it

at Lacedaemon to be their master's intention, to bring over

all the neighbouring States into this alliance : So that it

was entirely with public views, that Brasidas insisted upon

treating with Arribaeus. But Perdiccas urged in opposition,

that " he had not brought Brasidas to be the judge of his

" controversies, but to execute his vengeance on the ene-
