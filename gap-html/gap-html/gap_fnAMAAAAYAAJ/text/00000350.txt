236 THE PELOP0NNESIAN WAR.

" made the decree ; and now I earnestly conjure you, not to

" repent of your own determinations, not to plunge yourselves

" in inextricable difficulties, through pity, through delight of

" hearing, and soft forbearance, the three most prejudicial ob-

" and at once resolve to make them feel that weight of

" misery they designed for us. Convince them that those

" who have escaped it can feel as strong resentments as

" those who projected the fatal blow. Determine now, by
