580 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR.

their commandant, who resided there by the orders of the

Athenians to guard the place, they dispatch a messenger to

the other commander in Thrace, Thucydides the son of

Olorus, who compiled this history, and was then in Thasus

(Thasus is an island, a colony of the Parians, and distant
