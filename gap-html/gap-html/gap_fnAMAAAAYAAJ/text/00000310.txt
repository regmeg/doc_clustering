196 THE FELOPONNESIAN WAR.

near the place from whence they had pursued this victory.

They took up their dead, and the shattered pieces of their

ships, whatever they found on their own coasts, and by a truce

gave permission to the Peloponnesians to fetch off theirs.

The Peloponnesians also erected a trophy, in token of a

victory gained by forcing ashore and damaging some of the

enemy's ships. The ship they took they consecrated on the

at Athens that the enemy would attempt in this manner to

surprise them : For, openly, and in a regular train, they

durst not attempt it; nor could a project which required

deliberate procedure have escaped discovery. But no sooner

bad they resolved upon, than they set out to execute the

present scheme. Arriving in the night, they drew the ships
