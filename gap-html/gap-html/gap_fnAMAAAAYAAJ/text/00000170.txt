56 THE PEiOPONNESIAN TiR.

" the invader without a struggle would have leisurely deter-

" mined the fate of Greece.

" Do we then deserve, Lacedaemonians, that violence of

" envy with which the Grecians behold us, for the courage

" we manifested then, for our judicious resolution, and the

" superior power we now enjoy ? That power, superior as it

" is, was by no means the effect of violent encroachments.

" You would not abide with us to glean away the relics of
