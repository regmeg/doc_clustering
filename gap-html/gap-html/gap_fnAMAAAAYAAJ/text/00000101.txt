DISCOURSE III. XCV

" lence and a desire to sow dissentions amongst them. He

" exhorts to union, and to the observation of order. So

a Athens rose ; so Athens may yet be much higher exalted.

" The fire of youth, the temper of the middle-aged, and

" the experience of the old should ever duly accord and act

M together. Sloth ruins a community; practice enables it

44 to go through every conflict, and to triumph over all oppo-

" sition."

Such an address could not but affect, such arguments

could not but be persuasive with the people of Athens : The

expedition must go forwards. But Nicias makes a second

effort, if possible, to divert them from it.

He begins with " a prayer for its success ; and a desire,

" that the preparations may be adequate to the ends pro-

44 posed. He states the nature, the power, and strength of

" the people they are going to invade. He then, in gene-

" ral terms, gives in a bulky roll of necessary articles for

" those who invade them. He hopes to frighten and deter

44 his audience by the vast expence, which he shews must

" necessarily be incurred on this occasion. The Athenians

44 must provide every thing themselves, and trust for nothing

" to the care and fidelity of Sicilian allies. The public wel-

44 fare, and the safety of all, who are to be employed in this

44 expedition, demand all manner of previous foresight and

" care."

This speech had a different effect to what Nicias designed.

Instead of discouraging, it animated his countrymen more

than ever for execution. Accordingly, a decree was soon

passed, investing himself and his colleagues, who were Alci-

biades and Lamachus, with full power to provide every thing

needful for the service.

All hands now were soon at work. The quotas from the

dependents were demanded; the fleet was equipped and

manned ; the levies went on briskly, since all men came into

the service with alacrity ; and every thing was soon ready for

the expedition.
