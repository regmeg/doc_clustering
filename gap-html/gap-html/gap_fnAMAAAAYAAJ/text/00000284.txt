honour their caprices, but could contradict and disregard

their anger with peculiar dignity. Whenever he saw them

bent on projects injurious or unreasonable, he terrified them

so by the force of his eloquence, that he made them tremble

and desist; and when they were disquieted by groundless

apprehensions, he animated them afresh into brave resolution.

The State under him, though stiled a democracy, was in fact

a monarchy. His successors, more on a level with one ano­
