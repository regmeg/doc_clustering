SOME ACCOUNT OF DR. SMITH.

From this time the Dean's friends saw, with infinite con­

cern, his health gradually declining. In the year 1786, he

Was exceedingly indisposed. In November, he was confined

to his room ; in December, to his—bed.

About eight, on Friday morning, the 12th of January, 1787,

the Dean meekly resigned his spirit into the hands of a mer­

ciful Redeemer. On the Friday following, the funeral pro­

cession passed the nearest way to the Cathedral: the Bishop

and five Prebendaries were pall-bearers. The body reposeth

on the south side of the holy table. The Dean's name ap­

pears over his grave.

In the broad aisle, at the great pillar on your right hand,

as you retire from the choir, an elegant and costly Monument*

is erected to his memory by Mrs. Smith, who was a Miss

Heber of Essex. He only once married.

The Dean never was a stipendiary curate. The moment he

was ordained a Priest, he became a Rector; and enjoyed ever

after an income which far exceeded his expenses. An enemy

to ostentatious legacies, he bequeathed the chief of his fortune,

which was very considerable, to his widow and his nephew,

for he had no children. He gave one hundred pounds to the

Chester Infirmary, and one hundred pounds to the fund for

widows of clergymen in the archdeaconry of Chester: these

he esteemed useful charities.

The Dean was tall and genteel: his voice was strong, clear,

and melodious. He spoke Latin fluently, and was complete

master not only of the Greek, but Hebrew language. His

mind was so replete with knowledge, that he was a living li­

brary. His manner of address was graceful, engaging, de­

lightful. His sermons were pleasing, informing, convincing.

His memory, even in age, was wonderfully retentive: and

his conversation was polite, affable, and in the highest degree

improving.
