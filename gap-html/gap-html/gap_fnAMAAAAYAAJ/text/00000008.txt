CHARACTER op the WORK.

The public is here presented with a translation of one of the best histo­

ries of antiquity ; a history full of important instruction. The pernicious

consequences of faction in states, the tendency that power rigorously or

wantoi^y exercised has to make men desperate, and that liberty, when

abused, has to make them insolent; is no where more strongly represented,

than in the grave and judicious Thucydioes. In him too we see false pa­

triots and venal orators dressed out in genuine colours, and those who em­

ploy their eloquence and abilities to promote the public interest, and exert

themselves to the utmost of their power in the support of liberty, drawn at

full length and in just proportions.

With regard to the translation now before us, we shall only say, that its

merit is superior to any praises we can bestow, and that it will, we are

persuaded, approve itself to the judgment of such (and such only are pro­

per judges) as have an Attic taste, and are well acquainted with the turn

and manner of the original. That our readers may see, in some measure,

how our ingenious translator has succeeded, both in the oratorial and nar­

rative part, we shall present them with the celebrated oration of Pericles,

made at the public funeral of the Athenians, and the account of the plague

at Athens, both in the second book of the history of Tiicctiudbs.
