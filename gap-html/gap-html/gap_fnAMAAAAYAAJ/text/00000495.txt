ers without. And thus, in their present consternation, the

proposal was generally received as mild and gentle. The

Athenians for their part, who thought themselves more ex­

posed to danger than the rest, and had besides no hope of

speedy relief, were delighted with the offer of quitting the

place. So also were all the rest, that they were not to lose

their rights and liberties as citizens, and should thus escape

the danger they had dreaded, even beyond their hopes.

Upon this, the agents of Brasidas expatiated only on the mild­

ness and generosity of the terms he had offered, because now

they perceived that the multitude had altered their sentiments,

and would no longer hearken to the Athenian commandant.

In short, an accommodation was perfected, and they opened

the gates to Brasidas, upon the conditions he had proposed

by his herald. And in this manner did the inhabitants de­

liver up Amphipolis.

But in the evening of the same day, Thucydides and

the squadron came over to Eion. Brasidas was already in

possession of Amphipolis, and designed that very night to

seize Eion also. And unless this squadron had come in

thus critically to its defence, at break of day it had been

lost.

Thucydides instantly took care to put Eion in a pos­

ture of defence, in case Brasidas should attack it; and to

provide farther for its future security, when he had opened

a refuge there for such as were willing to remove thither

from Amphipolis, according to the articles of the late sur­

render.

But Brasidas on a sudden fell down the river with a

large number of boats towards Eion, desig»iug if possible

to seize the point of land that juts out from the walls, which

would have given him the command of the river's mouth.

He endeavoured at the same time also to assault it by

land, but was repulsed in both attempts. And now he ef­

fectually employed his care in resettling and securing Am­

phipolis.
