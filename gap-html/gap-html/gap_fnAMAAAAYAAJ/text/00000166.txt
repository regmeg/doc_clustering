THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR.

" those which progressively improve must, like all the works

" of art, be ever the best. Were indeed the continuance of

" peace ensured, unvarying manners would certainly be pre-

" ferable : But such people as are liable to frequent vicissi-

To this effect the Corinthians spoke. And it happenedr

that at this very juncture an Athenian embassy was at Lace-

daemon, negotiating some other points; who, so soon as they

were advertised of what had been said, judged it proper to

demand an audience of the Lacedaemonians. It was not

their design to make the least reply to the accusations preÂ­
