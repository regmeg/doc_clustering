DISCOURSE III.

A SURVEY

OF THE HISTORY.

IN the preceding discourse we have examined into the ca­

pacity and qualifications of our author for writing history, and

settled his character. Let us now take a view of the work

itself; first casting our eyes upon and noting the general dis­

position of the whole ; and then surveying it more distinctly

in its parts.

The disposition of the whole is most elaborately exact.

Order is scrupulously observed ; and every incident so faith­

fully arranged in its proper time, that some have doubted

whether annals were not a more proper title for it than

history. If we should call it annals, it must be owned at the

same time that annals were never composed with so much

majesty and spirit; and never was history more accurately

distinguished by the punctuality of dates so nicely inter­

wove. Thucydides states every occurrence in just place

and time. But he is forced for this purpose to make fre­

quent transitions, and to drop a particular narration, perhaps

the very moment a reader's attention may be most fixed up­

on and most eager for the event. If they cannot bear a

disappointment here, the remedy is ready at hand. By

turning over a few leaves, they will find it regularly resumed

in due place and time: and they at once may satisfy their

own curiosity, without disarranging the author's scheme, or

perplexing that work which he was determined to keep

quite clear and unembarrassed. They will afterwards for.
