386 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR.

sidas caused proclamation to be made to those Toroneans

who had fled for refuge to the Athenians, that " such as were

" willing might return to their old habitations, and should

" enjoy their rights without any molestation." But to the

Athenians a herald was sent expressly, commanding them

" to evacuate Lecythus which rightfully belonged to the
