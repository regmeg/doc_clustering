374 THE PEL0PONNESIAN WAR.

Tanagra, and called a consultation about the method of asÂ­

saulting Delium.

A herald, farther, dispatched by the Athenians about their

dead, meets upon his way a herald of the Boeotians, who

turned him back by assuring him that his errand would be

fruitless till he himself should be again returned. The latter,

being come to the Athenians, declared to them in the name

of the Boeotians;

" THAT by their late proceedings they had enormously

" violated the laws of the Grecians, amongst whom it was

" an established rule, that amidst their mutual invasions re-

" ligious places should be ever spared, whereas the Athe-

" of habitation, and whatever profanations mankind can be

" guilty of had been there by them committed: That the

44 water, which it would even be impious for the Boeotians

" themselves to touch, unless by way of ablution, before

" they sacrificed, had been profanely drawn by them for

" common use: That, for these reasons the Boeotians, in

" the cause of the God and in their own, invoking the as-

" sociated Daemons and Apollo, gave them this early no-

" tice to evacuate the sacred place, and clear it of all in-

" cumbrances."

This message being thus delivered by the herald, the

Athenians returned this answer to the Boeotians by a herald

of their own:

" THAT they were hitherto guilty of nothing illegal in

" future. They had no such intention when they first en-

" tered into it, and their view was merely to give an ejec-

" tion from thence to persons who had basely injured them.

" It was a law among the Grecians for those who were

" masters of any district, whether great or small, to be also

" proprietors of its temples, which are to be honoured by

" them with the usual forms, and with what additional ones

" they may be able to appoint. Even the Boeotians, as well
