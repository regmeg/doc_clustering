" That the ambassadors, who were now present in the as-

" sembly, shall give a solemn ratification that they will

The Lacedaemonians and their allies agreed to these arti­

the Athenians and their allies at Lacedaemon, on the twelfth

day of the month Gerastius.

The persons who settled the articles and assisted at the

sacrifice were,

For the Lacedaemonians—Taurus the son of Echetimi-

das, Athenaeus the son of Periclidas, Philocharidas the son

of Eryxidaidas. For the Corinthians—./Eneas the son of

Ocytus, Euphamidas the son of Aristonymus. For the Si-

cyonians—Damotimus the son of Naucrates, Onasimus the

6on of Megacles. For the Megareans—Nicasus the son of

Cecalus, Menecrates the son of Amphidorus. For the Epi-

daurians—Amphias the son of Eupaeidas. For the Athe-

nians^-Nicostratus the son of Diotrephes, Nicias the son of

Niceratus, Autocles the son of Tolmaeus, Generals of the

State.

ces with one another, about settling the terms of a firm and

lasting peace. '

During the interval these matters were thus in agitation,

Brasidas. The Scioneans indeed in the Pellene give out

that they are of Peloponnesus ; that their ancestors who

settled in these other seats were driven there originally by a

storm, which in their return from Troy dispersed the Achaeans.
