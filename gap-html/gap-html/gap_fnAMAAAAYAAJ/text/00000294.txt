180 THE PELOPONNES!AJi WAR.

broke by the Plataeans, who threw ropes around them ; they

also tied large beams together, with long chains of iron at

both ends of the beams, by which they hung downwards

from two other transverse beams inclined and extended be­

yond the wall ;—these they drew along obliquely, and

against whatever part they saw the engine of battery to be

aimed, they let go the beams with a full swing of the chains,

and so dropped them down directly upon it, which by the

weight of the stroke broke off the beak of the battering ma­

chine. Upon this the Peloponnesians, finding all their en­

gines useless, and their mount effectually counterworked by

the fortification within, concluded it a business of no little

hazard to take the place amidst so many obstacles, and pre­

pared to draw a circumvallation about it.

But first they were willing to try whether it were not pos­

sible to set the town on fire, and burn it down, as it was not

large, by help of a brisk gale of wind; for they cast their

thoughts towards every expedient of taking it without a large

expence and a tedious blockade. Procuring for this purpose

a quantity of faggots, they tossed them from their own

mount into the void space between the wall and the inner

fortification. As many hands were employed in this busi­

more of them into the other parts of the city lying beyond,

as far as they could by the advantage which the eminence

gave them. Upon these they threw fiery balls made of sul­

phur and pitch, which caught the faggots, and soon kindled

such a flame as before this time no one had ever seen

kindled by the art of man. It hath indeed sometimes hap­

pened, that wood growing upon mountains hath been so

heated by the attrition of the winds, that without any other

cause it hath broke out into fire and flame. But this was

exceeding fierce ; and the Plataeans, who had baffled all

other efforts, were very narrowly delivered from perishing

by its fury ; for it cleared the city to a great distance round

Kbout, so that no Plataean durst approach it: And if the
