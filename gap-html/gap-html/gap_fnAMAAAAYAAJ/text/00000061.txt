DISCOURSE II. lv

" exposes the Sublime to sudden falls. Nor am I ignorant

" indeed of another thing, which will no doubt be urged, that

" in passing our judgment upon the works of an author, we

" always muster his imperfections, so that the remembrance

u of his faults sticks indelibly fast in the mind, whereas that

" of his excellencies is quickly worn out. For my part, I

" have taken notice of no inconsiderable number of faults in

" Homer, and some other of the greatest authors, and cannot

" by any means be blind or partial to them ; however, I judge

" them not to be voluntary faults, so much as accidental slips

" incurred through inadvertence ; such as, when the mind is

" intent upon things of a higher nature, will creep insensibly

" into compositions. And for this reason I give it as my real

" opinion, that the great and noble flights, though they cannot

" every where boast an equality of perfection, yet ought to

" carry off the prize by the sole merit of their own intrinsic

" grandeur."
