322 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR.

to some notice received that he was bent on landing upon the

island ; as the soldiers, terribly incommoded by the straitness

of their stations, and resembling besieged more than besiegers,

were eager for this bold adventure. Demosthenes was ani­

mated more to the attempt because the island had lately been

set on fire. Before this accident, as it had been quite covered

over with wood, and was pathless, because ever uninhabited,

he durst not think of such a step, and judged all these cir­

destroyed, as it could not be discerned which part of it was

hardest pressed, and stood most in need of support.

These inward suggestions were more prevalent in the

mind of Demosthenes from the remembrance of his iEtolian

defeat, which was partly owing to the woods amongst which

he engaged. But as the narrowness of their station had

necessitated his soldiers to land sometimes upon the skirts of

dress their repast, a soldier, though entirely without design,

set t!i5"wood on fire, which spread but slowly, till a brisk

gale happening to arise, the greatest part of it was unex­

pectedly destroyed by the flames. Demosthenes, having

gained by this means a clearer view of the Lacedaemonians,

found them more numerous than from the quantity of vie­
