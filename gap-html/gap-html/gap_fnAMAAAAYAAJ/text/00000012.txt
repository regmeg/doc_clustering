VI DEDICATION.

The Maritime power of Great Britain is more sub­

stantially founded, and hath ever been more steadily

supported dian was that of Athens. The most com­

plete and most lasting Form of Government, that man

can invent, happily subsists in this Realm under Your

Royal Grandfather. The British Constitution

hath long been, and may it long continue to be the

envy of other Nations! For the future support of it,

the public hopes and expectations are fixed upon Your

Royal Highness. Long may His MAJESTY

Your Royal Grandfather live to secure the free­

dom and happiness of his People, that Your Royal

Highness may become equal, in every respect, to the

same great and glorious Charge !

I have a heart duly sensible of the great honour con­

ferred upon me, by being thus permitted to profess my­

self,

Your Royal Highness's

most devoted and

most humble Servant,

WILLIAM SMITH.

London, 1753.
