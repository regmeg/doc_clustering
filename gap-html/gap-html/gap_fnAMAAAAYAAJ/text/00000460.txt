346 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR.

" which all the world allovveth ;â€”what hindereth us then, why

" we should not firmly establish it with one another ? or, do

" you rather imagine, that if the condition of one man be

" happy and that of another be wretched, tranquillity will not

" contribute sooner than warfare to amend the state of the

" latter, and to preserve the state of the former from a sad

" latter, instead of inlarging, to suffer the loss of what they

" already possessed. For revenge is not certain, because

"justly sought after to retaliate violence; nor is power as-

" sured of its end, because invigorated with sanguine expec-

" tation. Events are for the most part determined by the

" fallible unsteady balance of futurity; which, though de-

" ceivable as deceit can be, yet holds out before us the most

" instructive hints. For thus, armed equally beforehand

" with needful apprehension, we embark into mutual contests

" with wise premeditation. Now therefore, checked by the

" gloomy dread of the yet invisible event, and awed on all

" sides by the terrors which the presence of these Athenians
