TO HIS

ROYAL HIGHNESS

THE

PRINCE OF WALES.

SIR,

THE History of Thucydides hath been studiously

read and admired by the greatest Princes, and may

therefore presume to lay some claim to the Protection

of Your Royal Highness. Great Britain, of all the

States now existing in the world, most nearly resem-

bleth what Athens was at the time when the War,

which is the Subject of it, broke out in Greece. A

love of Liberty, which hath erroneously been supposed

to thrive and flourish best in a democratical Govern­

ment, was then warm and active in every Athenian.

Athens, it is true, had thus been raised to a great height

of maritime power, and was become a very formidable

State; But Faction disjointed a noble Plan, and at

length brought on the loss of her Sovereignty at Sea.

The Athenians soon ceased to be great, when they de­

viated from those salutary maxims, which their worthiest

Patriots and most consummate Statesmen had recom­

mended to their constant observance.
