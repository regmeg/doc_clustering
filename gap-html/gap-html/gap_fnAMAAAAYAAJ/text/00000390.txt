276 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR.

is believed by those people, that Vulcan keeps his forge in

Hiera*, because in the night it visibly throws forth a great

quantity of fire, and in the day of smoke. These isles are

situated over-against the shore of the Siculi and the Messe-

nians, and were allied with Syracuse. The Athenians hav­

ing plundered the soil, and finding the inhabitants would not

come in, put back again to Rhegium.—And here the win­

ter ended, and the fifth year of this war, the history of which

Thucydides hath compiled.

YEAR VI.

THE following summer, the Peloponnesians and confede­

rates assembled at the Isthmus, in order to make the usual

inroad into Attica ; and Agis, son of Archidamus, king of

the Lacedaemonians, was there ready for the command. But

the frequent earthquakes which happened about this time,

caused them to return back, and entirely put a stop to the

designed incursion.

About the same space of time shocks of earthquakes

were felt in Euboea, where at Orobi* the sea breaking over

what was then land with impetuous swells, laid a part of

that city under water: Some of which stagnated there,

though some washed its way back: however a tract now

continues sea which before was land. All those who could

not reach the higher grounds in time, by running before

the surge, were drowned.—A similar inundation happened

at the isle of Atalanta, amongst the Locrians of Opus,

where it washed away the Athenian fort, and of two ves­

sels that lay dry upon the beach staved one to pieces. . -

Insula sicanium juxta latus /Eoliamque

Erifritur Liparum fumantibus arrlua saxis:

Qiiam subter specus & Cyclopum exesa caminis

Antra £tnxa tonant, valadique incudibus ictus

Auditi referunt gemitum, striduntque cavernis

Stricturx Chalvbiim, & f'ornacihus ignis anhelnt

Vulcani domus, & Vulcania nomine tt-llus.
