r> SOME ACCOUNT

OF

THE LIFE AND WRITINGS

OF

DR. SMITH,

BY THE REV. THOMAS CRANE, OF CHESTER.

WILLIAM SMITH, son of the Rev. Richard Smith,

Rector of the Church of All Saints, and Minister of St. An足

drews, in the city of Worcester, was born in the Parish of St.

Peter's Church in that city, on the 30th day of May, in the

year 1711. He was educated in grammar-learning at the

College-School in his native city, where he made great pro足

ficiency in his studies. In January 1725-6, it pleased God

to deprive him of his father. On the 27th day of Novem足

ber, 1728, he was matriculated at New College in Oxford;

where he took the degree of Bachelor of Arts in June, 1732;

and that of Master in July, 1737.

Soon after he had taken his Bachelor's degree, his merit

caused him to be recommended to the Right Hon. James

Earl of Derby, that great Patron of Arts and Sciences: and

he was retained three years in his lordship's house, in the

office of Reader to his lordship. His connections with my

Lord of Derby introduced him to the honour of being known

to several other persons of fortune and quality; which was

of singular service to him in his progress through life.

A gentleman by birth, blessed with an excellent capacity

and education, and having ready and easy intercourse with

the great and good, it is no wonder that he was adorned with

manners most polite, with literary accomplishments most

splendid and solid, and with morals becoming a faithful ser足

vant of the holy Jesus. Well qualified for the work of the
