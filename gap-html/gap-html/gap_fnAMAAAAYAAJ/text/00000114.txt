A Survey of the History.

nor address in promoting that cause of liberty, which was the

grand pretext for engaging in this destructive war. They

seem at last more intent on pocketing the royal subsidies,

than doing their duty as leaders and champions of Greece.

They have not yet learned to make a figure at sea. The last

view we have of them is at the battle of Cynos-sema, where

they receive a signal defeat from those very men, whose ruin

they judged was well nigh compleated. When Athens is

totally to be vanquished, as her doom is fast approaching, she

must aid her own conquerors and tyrants, in demolishing her

own trophies, and trampling under foot her liberties and

rights. Her own factions will help to accomplish, what withÂ­

out them no foreign enemy could have done. Whatever

is human must decay. The best-constituted State in the

world may be undermined by its own members, when they

could not be conquered, and at length be rendered an easy

prey to foreign powers. May GREAT-BRITAIN prove

an exception to this affecting but just observation !
