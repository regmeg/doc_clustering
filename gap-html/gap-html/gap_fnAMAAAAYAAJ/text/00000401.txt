a part of the army to flight, and slew a considerable num足

ber.

After this, Laches and the Athenians, having made some

attempts, and landed on the coast of Locris near the mouth of

the river Caicinus, were engaged by a party of Locrians con*

sisting of about three hundred, under Proxenus, the son of

Capaton. These the Athenians defeated, and having strip足

ped them of their arms, went off the coast.

The same winter also the Athenians purified Delos, in

obedience to an oracle. Pisistratus the tyrant had purified

it formerly, not indeed the whole, but so much of the

island as lies within the prospect of the temple. The purifi足

cation now was universal, and performed in the following

manner.

They broke up all the sepulchres of the dead without ex足

ception, and prohibited for the future any death or birth in

the island, both which were to be confined to Rheiuea. For

Rhenaea lies at so small a distance from Delos, that Poly-

crates the tyrant of Samos, who was formerly of great power

by sea, amongst other isles he reduced to his dominions,took

Rhenaea also, which he consecrated to Delian Apollo, and

fastened it to Delos by a chain. And after this purification,

the Athenians made the first institution of the Delian games

to be solemnized every fifth returning year. Not but that in

the earlier times there was used to be a great conflux of Io-

nians and neighbouring islanders to Delos. They resorted

to the solemn festivals there with their wives and children, in

the same manner as the Ionians do now to Ephesus. Games

of bodily exercise and of music were actually celebrated, and

cities exhibited their respective chorusses. For this we have

the testimony of Homer, in the following verses of his hymn

to Apollo.

To thee, O Phoebus, most the Delian isle

Gives cordial joy, excites the pleasing smile ;

When gay Ionians flock around thy fane ;

Men, women, children, a resplendent train,
