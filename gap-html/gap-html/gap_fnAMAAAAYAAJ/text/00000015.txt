PREFACE.

IT was not from a private choice, but from deference to

what was judged a public call, that the following translation

of Thucydides was first undertaken. To explain the motive

more largely, might perhaps incur the imputation of imperti­

nence or vanity. The performance, upon the whole, must

justify the undertaking. In what manner it is done, and not

why it was done, will be the point of public arbitration.

It will be also needless to tell the English Reader, how

many versions have been made of Thucydides into Latin.

Their design was to bring the author more under the obser­

vation of what is generally styled the learned world ; as the

translations of him into modern languages have aimed at in­

troducing him into general acquaintance, as a historian ca­

pable of innocently amusing most ranks of men, but of use­

fully instructing the persons, who from duty and from

passion would guard the rights or secure the welfare of pub­

lic communities. The grand business of History is to make

men wiser in themselves and better members of society. For

this purpose it recals past ages to their view; and thus opens

a more extensive scope to reflection than any personal expe­

rience can offer. To be well versed in a similarity of cases

prepares men better for counsel or action on present contin­

gencies. The statesman, the patriot, the friend to liberty and

reason will be better enabled to plan and to regulate his own

measures, when he can see the tendency and consequence of

such as were followed on parallel occasions, and adjust the

degrees, in which they were either prejudicial or serviceable

to public good.
