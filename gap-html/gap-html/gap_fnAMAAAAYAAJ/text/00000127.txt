had compleated the conquest of Croesus and all the country

which lieth between the fiver Halys and the sea, invaded

them and inslaved their towns upon the continent: And Da­

that the tyrants were by them extirpated from Greece, not

many years intervened before the battle of Marathon was

fought by the Medes against the Athenians: And in the
