(for Pylus is a part of the ancient Messenia), infested Laconia ,

with depredations and did them vast damage, the more be­

cause they spoke the same dialect*.

As for the Lacedaemonians, who never knew before what

it was to be thus plundered, war in such a shape being new

to them, and their Helots deserting continually to the foe ; ap­

prehensive farther, lest such unusual proceedings within their

own district might draw worse consequences after them—

they had a painful sense of their present situation. This

compelled them to send their embassies to Athens, desirous

however at the same time to conceal what they really thought

of their own state, and spare no artifice for the recovery of

Pylus and their people. But the Athenians grew more un­

reasonable in their demands, and after many journeys to and

fro sent them finally away with an absolute denial. Such was

the course of proceedings in relation to Pylus.

The same summer, and immediately on the close of the

former event, the Athenians set out to invade Corinth with

a fleet of eighty ships which carried two thousand heavy-

armed of their own people, and with some horse-transports

on board of which were two hundred horsemen. They were

also attended by some of their confederates, by the Milesians

and Andrians and Carysthians. Nicias the son of Niceratus

with two colleagues commanded this armament. At the

early dawn of morning they came to anchor between Cherro-

nesus and Reitus, on the shore of that place which the Soly-

gian hill overhangs, of which formerly the Dorians possess­

ing themselves made war upon the Corinthians then in Co­

rinth who were of iEolian descent. Upon that eminence

there is now a village called Solygia. From the shore where

the armament came now to anchor, this village was distant

about twelvej, the city of Corinth sixtyf, and the Isthmus

twenty stadia^.
