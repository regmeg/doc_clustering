248 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR.

The Peloponnesians supplied the Plataeans with necessary

sustenance for the space of a few days, till the five delegates

arrived from Lacedaemon to preside at their trial. And yet,

when these were actually come, no judicial process was form­

ed against them. They only called them out, and put this

short question to them—" Whether they had done any ser-

" vice to the Lacedaemonians and their allies in the present

" war ?"—Their answer was, that they begged permission to

urge their plea at large ; which being granted, they pitched

upon Astymachus the son of Asopalaus and Laco the son of

Aeimnestus, who had formerly enjoyed the public hospitality

of the Lacedaemonians, to be their speakers, who stood forth,

and pleaded thus

" PLACING in you, O Lacedaemonians, an entire con-

" fidence, we have delivered up our city ; but never imagined

" we should be forced to such a process as this, when we ex-

" pected only to be tried by justice and laws—when we yield-

" ed to plead, not before other judges, as is now our fate ;

" but only before yourselves. Then indeed we thought, that

"justice might be obtained.—But now, we have terrible

" grounds for apprehending, that we have at once been doubly

" over-reached. Strong motives occur to alarm our suspi-

" cions, that the point most in view is to deprive us of our

" lives, and that you will not prove impartial judges. We

" cannot but be too certain of this, when no manner of crime

" is formally objected, against which we might form our de-

" fence ; when barely at our own intreaty we are heard, and

" your concise demand is such, that if we answer it with

" truth we condemn ourselves ; if with falsehood, must be

" instantly refuted.

" Thus on all sides beset with perplexities, something of

" necessity must be said in our own behalf; nay, where the

" danger is so urgent, the only small glimpse of security ap-

•4 pears in hazarding a plea. For persons like us distressed,

u in silence to abandon their own defence—this may with

" sad compunction torture them at last, as if their safety

" might have been earned by speaking for themselves—
