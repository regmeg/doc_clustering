YEAR III.

EARLY the next summer, the Peloponnesians and their

allies, omitting the incursion as before into Attica, marched

their forces against Plateea. Archidamus son of Zeuxida-

mus, king of the Lacedaemonians, commanded ; who, having

encamped his army, was preparing to ravage the adjacent

country. He was interrupted by an embassy from the Pla-

" that no one should ever unjustly make war upon them, or

" endeavour to enslave them; and in case of such attempts,

" all the confederates then present should avenge it to the

" utmost of their power." Such grateful returns did your

" fathers make us in recompence of our valour, and the zeal

" we excited in the common dangers. Yet their generosity

" you are now reversing—you, with the Thebans, our inve-

" terate foes, are come hither to enslave us. But, by the

" Gods, who were then witnesses to the oath they swore, by

" all the tutelary Deities both of your own and of our com-

" ground, nor to violate your oaths, but to retire and leave
