B. r. INTRODUCTION. 25

" IT is quite proper, Athenians, that those who address

" themselves to a neighbouring power imploring their suc-

" cour, which is now our case, without being able to plead

" the merit of prior good-services or an old alliance in their

" own behalf, should previously convince them, chiefly, that

" a compliance with such requests must turn to their advan-

" tage ; at least, that it will cause no manner of inconve-

" Once already we have engaged the Corinthians at sea,

" and repulsed them merely by our own strength. But, since

" with a greater force collected from Peloponnesus and the

" rest jof Greece they are again preparing to attack us ; since

" we perceive ourselves unable to resist them merely with

" our own domestic strength ; since further with our subjec-

" tion the danger will spread abroad; we are necessitated to

" apply to you and every where else for succour ; and though

" now emboldened to act in opposition to our former inactive

" maxims, yet we deserve your pardon, as they were not the

" result of bad designs, but of mistaken judgments : and could

" we but obtain redress from you, this incidental necessity of
