356 THE PEI.OPONNESIAN WAR.

Soon afterwards, the confederates being dismissed to

their respective cities, Brasidas also himself returned to Co­

rinth to continue his preparations for that Thracian expedi­

tion, in which before this avocation he had been intently

employed.

The Athenians also being now marched homewards, the

Megar>ans in the city, who had acted most zealously in fa­

vour of the Athenians, finding all their practices detected,

stole off as fast as possible. The others, after concerting the

proper steps with the friends of the exiles, fetch them home

from Pegae, having first administered to them the most

solemn oaths " to think no more on former injuries, and to

" promote the true welfare of the city to the utmost of their

* power."

But these, when re-invested with authority, and taking a

review of the troops of the city, having previously disposed

some bands of soldiers in a proper manner, picked out about

a hundred persons of their enemies, and who they thought

had busied themselves most in favour of the Athenians. And

having compelled the people to pass a public vote upon them,

they were condemned to die and suffered an instant execu­

tion. They farther new-modelled the government of Me-

gara into almost an oligarchy. And this change, though

introduced by an inconsiderable body of men ; nay, what is

more, in the train of sedition, yet continued for a long space

of time in full force at Megara.

The same summer, the Mityleneans being intent on exer

cuting their design of fortifying Antandrus, Demodocus and

Aristides, who commanded the Athenian squadron for levy­

ing contributions, and were now at Hellespont ("for Lama-

chus the third in the commission had been detached with

ten ships towards Pontus), when informed of what was thus

in agitation, became apprehensive that Antandrus might

prove of as bad consequence to them as Ana>a in Samos had

already done; wherein, the Samian exiles having fortified

themselves, were not only serviceable to the Peloponnesians
