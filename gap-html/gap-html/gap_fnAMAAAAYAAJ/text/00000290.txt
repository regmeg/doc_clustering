176 THE KLOPONNESIAN WAR.

" us in that state of independence which Pausanias justly

" established for us." To these words of the Plateans

Archidamus made this reply—

" What you have urged, ye men of Plateea, is just and rea-

" sonable, if it be found agreeable to your actions. Let the

" declarations of Pausanias be observed; be free and inde-

" pendent yourselves, and at the same time vindicate their

" own freedom to others, to those who, after participation of

" the same common dangers, made that oath in your favour,

" keep at quiet, enjoying only what is properly your own ;

" side with neither party ; receive both in the way of friend-

" ship, in the way of enmity neither.—To a conduct like this

" we never shall object."

" oath to the two principal powers, might again attempt to

" seize their city."—Archidamus, to remove their apprehen­

sions, spoke as follows " Deliver up your city and your

" houses to us Lacedaemonians; let us know the bounds of

" your territory and the exact number of your trees, and

" make as true a calculation as you possibly can of all that

a belongs to you. Depart yourselves, and reside wherever

" you please so long as the war continues ; at the end of it
