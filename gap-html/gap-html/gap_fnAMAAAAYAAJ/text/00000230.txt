PELOPONNESIAN WAR.

BOOK II.

YEAR I.—BEFORE CHRIST 431.

HENCE instantly commenceth the war between the Pe-

loponnesians and Athenians, and the confederates on both

sides—during which they had no kind of intercourse with one

another without the herald; and now, once engaged, carried

it on without intermission. The particular incidents of it are

orderly related by the Summer and the Winter.

The Thirty-years Peace, which was made after the con­

quest of Euboea, had now lasted fourteen: But in the

fifteenth year, when Chrysis had been forty-eight years

Priestess at Argos, when iEnesias was Ephorus at Sparta,

and Pythodorus ten months Archon at Athens, in the sixth

month after the battle at Potidaea, and in the very begin­

ning of the spring a body of Thebans, somewhat above

three hundred, under the command of Pythangelus the son

of Phylidas, and Diemporus the son of Onetoridas, two of

the rulers of Breotia, about the first sleep got into Plataea*

of Bffiotia with their arms, which place was then in alliance

• Plataea was a city and petty state in Bccotia, on the confines of Attica.

The inhabitants of it had ever been so fir mly attached to the liberties of

Greece, that it drew upon them the lasting rancour of the Thebans, who had

joined the Persians when they invaded Greece, and persuaded them to

burn down Plataea. The Plataeans engaged with the Athenians on the side

of Greece, in the famous battle fought within their own territory. The

Athenians, to shew their gratitude, gave them a place in the fine battle-

piece painted in the Paecile in honour of the victory, made them all citi­

zens of Athens, and ever after concluded their religious solemnities with a

prayer for the prosperity of the Plataeans.
