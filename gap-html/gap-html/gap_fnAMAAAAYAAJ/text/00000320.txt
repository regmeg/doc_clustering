THE

PELOPONNESIAN WAR.

BOOK III

YEAR IV—BEFORE CHRIST 428.

IN the succeeding Summer, the Peloponnesians and allies,

when the corn was full-grown, made incursion into Attica,

under the command of Archidamus son of Zeuxidamus king

of the Lacedaemonians, and having fixed their camp ravaged

the country. The Athenian cavalry at all convenient places

skirmished with them as usual, and checked the greater num­

ber of the light-armed from advancing before the heavy-arm­

ed, and infesting the parts adjacent to the city. Having con­

tinued here till provisions began to fail, they retired and were

disbanded to their respective cities.

Upon this irruption of the Peloponnesians, Lesbos im­

mediately revolted from the Athenians, excepting Methimne.

They were well inclined to such a step before the war broke

out, but were discountenanced by the Lacedaemonians, and

now were necessitated to make their revolt sooner than they

intended. They would have been glad to have deferred it,

till they had compleated the works they were about for secur­

ing their harbour, perfecting their walls and the ships then

upon the stocks—till they had received what they wanted

from Pontus, both archers .and corn, and whatever they had

already sent for thither.

The reason was the people of Tenedos then at enmity

with them, those of Methymne, and even some persons of

Mitylene underhand, who in a civil broil had received the
