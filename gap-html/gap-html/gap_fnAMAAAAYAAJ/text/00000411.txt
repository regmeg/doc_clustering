as a reinforcement for Sicily. Their motive was, not only

to bring the war in those parts to a speedy determination, but

also to keep their own mariners in constant practice. Pytho-

dorus, one of the admirals appointed for this service, they

sent immediately off with a few ships : Sophocles, son of Sos-

tradites, and Eurymedon, son of Thucles, were soon to fol­

low with the main body of the fleet. But Pythodorus, who

had now took the command from Laches, steered about the

close of the winter, against that fortress of the Locrians which

Laches had taken before. But, being defeated at his land­

ing by the Locrians, he returned again to his station.

About the spring of the year, a torrent of fire overflowed

from mount ./Etna, in the same manner as formerly, which

destroyed part of the lands of the Cataneans, who are situ­

ated at the foot of that mountain, which is the largest in all

Sicily. It is said that fifty years intervened between this

flow and the last which preceded ; and that in the whole, the

fire hath thus issued thrice since Sicily was inhabited by the

Grecians. Such were the occurrences of this winter, at the

end of which the sixth year also of this war, the history of

which Thucydides hath compiled, expired.
