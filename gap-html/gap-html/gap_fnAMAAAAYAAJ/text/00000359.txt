bassadors amply furnished them with wine and barley-cakes,

and promised them great rewards if they arrived in time.

By this means they were so eager to accelerate the passage,

that even whilst plying the oar they eat their cakes dipped in

wine and oil; and whilst one half of the number refreshed

themselves with sleep, the other kept rowing amain. So for­
