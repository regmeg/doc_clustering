16 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR.

/

But, from the testimonies alleged in support of what I

have hitherto advanced, any one may depend on my account

of things, without danger of false opinions. Let him with­

hold his credit from the songs of poets, whose profession it

is to give all possible enlargements to their subjects : Let him

do so farther, by the writers of prose*, who study more that

artful composition which captivateth the ear than the plain

and simple recital of truth, where proper attestations are

never to be found, and many things through length of time

have incredibly sallied out into mere fable: and then he will

be convinced upon the plainest proofs, that the state of an­

cient Greece was very nearly the same as I have described

it. And this present war, when considered in all its opera­

tions, notwithstanding the propensity of mankind to imagine

that war in which they are personally engaged, to be the

greatest that ever happened, and so soon as it is over to re­

place their admiration upon others more ancient, will easily

be owned to have been the most important of all.

As to the speeches of particular persons either at the com­

mencement or in the prosecution of the war, whether such

as I heard myself or such as were repeated to me by others,

I will not pretend to recite them in all their exactness. It

hath been my method to consider principally what might be

pertinently said upon every occasion to the points in debate,

and to keep as near as possible to what would pass for genu­

ine by universal consent. And as for the actions performed

in the course of this war, I have not presumed to describe

them from casual narratives or my own conjectures, but

either from certainty, where I myself was a spectator, or

from the most exact informations I have been able to collect

from others. This indeed was a work of no little difficulty,

because even such as were present at those actions disagreed

in their accounts about them, according as affection to either

side or memory prevailed.

My relation, because quite clear of fable, may prove less

• Thucydides is here supposed to glance at Herodotus ; and again a little

af;cr he justly thinks, thatyferion and fable ought to have no place in
history.
