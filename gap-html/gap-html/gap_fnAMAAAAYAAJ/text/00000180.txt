66 THE PEIOPONHESIAN WAR.

every city in Greece unwalled like Sparta ; but more to gra­

tify their confederates, inviting them to such a step from a

jealousy of the naval power of the Athenians, now greater

bravely exerted in the war against the Medes. They requir­

ed them to desist from building their walls, and rather to

join with them in levelling every fortification whatever with­
