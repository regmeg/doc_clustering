DISCOURSE I.

ON THE

LIFE OF THUCYDIDES.

IT is a natural piece of curiosity, either when we have

read a book we like, or hear one commended, to enquire after

the author. We acquiesce not in his bare name ; we imme­

diately seek farther informations. The stranger shews an

inclination to form some acquaintance with him; the reader

to improve what he already hath. We at length grow in­

quisitive about all that concerns him, and are eager to be let

into the particulars.

Some claim of this kind will no doubt be made in regard

to Thucydides. He who endeavours to introduce him to

general notice, ought at least to have something to say about

him, and something rather tending perhaps to give favoura­

ble impressions. All his editors and translators have reckon­

ed this a point of duty incumbent upon them: But, it hath

been generally performed in a very imperfect and slovenly

manner. His life wrote by Marcellinus, a crude incoherent

morsel, hath been prefixed to all the Greek editions. That

third in Greek by an anonymous author is also but a very

slight and shapeless sketch, and seems the work of a gramma­

rian, who hath read indeed but very superficially read his

history. Some incidental escapes from his own pen are the

marks, which should be always kept in view by him, who

would give any tolerable account of Thucydides. Writers

of a better age and class will contribute now and then a little
