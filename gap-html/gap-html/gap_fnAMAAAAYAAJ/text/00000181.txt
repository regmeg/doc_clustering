Themistocles, they easily acquiesced in such an answer. But

other persons afterwards arriving and making clear affirma­

tion that " the wall is carrying on and already built up to a

considerable height," they had it no longer in their power to

be incredulous. Themistocles, knowing this, exhorts them,

" not rashly to be biassed by rumours, but rather to send

away some trusty persons of their own body, who from a

view might report the truth." With this proposal they com­

members and for all their allies: It would not be possible,

with strength inferior to that of a rival-power, equally to pre­

serve and evenly to balance the public welfare of Greeoe."—

From hence he inferred, that " either aH cities of the state*
