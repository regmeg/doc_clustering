394 THE PELOPONNESIAK WAR.

was farther more truth in the date of the revolt than at pre­

sent the Athenians could evince : For, in fact, the Scioneans

revolted two clays too late. But at the instigation of Cleon

they immediately passed a decree, that " the Scioneans

" should be reduced by force, and then put to the sword."

And their attention was recalled from all other points,

to expedite the needful preparations for the execution of

this.

In the mean time, Mende also a city in the Pellene, and

a colony of Eretrians, revolted from them. Brasidas re­

ceived them into his protection, thinking himself justified,

as they had openly come over to him in the time of truce.

Besides, he had himself some reasons to recriminate upon

the Athenians, as violaters of the articles. Upon this ac­

count the Mendeans were more encouraged to the step, as

they saw Brasidas was determined to support them ; and

were convinced, by the affair of Scione, that he would not

abandon them. The design farther had been originally set

on foot by the yew ; who, though they delayed it for a time,

were resolved to push it into execution : for they appre­

and so forced the bulk of the people to act against their in­

clination. But the Athenians, who had a quick intelli­

gence of it, were now exasperated much more than be­

fore, and redoubled their preparations against both those

places.

Brasidas, who soon expected the arrival of their arma­

ment, conveyed away the wives and children of the Scio­

them escorted thither by five hundred heavy-armed Pelo-

ponnesians and three hundred Chalcidic targeteers: the

commander of the whole escort was Polydamidas. Those

left behind, expecting soon to be visited by the Athenians,

united their endeavours to get things in good order for their

reception.

In the interval, Brasidas and Perdiccas march together
