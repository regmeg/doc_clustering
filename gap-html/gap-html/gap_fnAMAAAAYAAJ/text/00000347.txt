" ver decreed; or, instigated by lucre, will endeavour to

" seduce you by the elaborate and plausible artifice of

" words. In such contentions, the State indeed awards the

" victory to whom she pleaseth, but she sustains all the da-

" You! who fondly doat on these wordy competitions !

" You ! who accustomed to be spectators of speeches and
