the son of Cimon, Diotimus the son of Strombichus, and Pro-

teas the son of Epicles. Their orders were " by no means to

" engage the Corinthians, unless they stood against and en-

" deavoured to make a descent at Corcyra, or any of its de-

" pendent places; if they did so, to resist them with all their

" efforts." These orders were given with a view of not in­

fringing the treaty: And this their aid of shipping arriveth

at Corcyra.

The Corinthians, when they had compleated their pre- /

parations, set sail for Corcyra with a fleet of one hundred

and fifty ships. Of these, ten belonged to the Eleans, twelve

to the Megareans, ten to the Leucadians, twenty-seven to

the Ambraciots, one to the Anactorians, and the other ninety

were their own. The quotas from the allied cities had each

of them their respective commanders ; but the Corinthian

squadron was commanded by Xenoclides, the son of Euthy-

bled at that part of the continent which looks towards Cor­

cyra, they set sail from Leucas, and arrive at the Chime-

rium in Thesprotis. A harbour openeth itself here, and

above it is the city of Ephyre, at a distance from the sea,

in Eleatis, a district of Thesprotis: Near it is the outlet into

the sea of the lake of Acherusia, into which the river Ache­

ron, having run through Thesprotis, is at last received; from

which it also deriveth its name. The river Thyamis also

runneth here, dividing Thesprotis from Cestrine, and be­

tween these two rivers ariseth the cape of Chimerium. The

Corinthians therefore arrive at this part of the continent,

and fix their station there. But the Corcyreans, so soon as

ever advised of their sailing, having manned a hundred and

ten^siups under the command of Miciades, iEsimides, and

Eurybatus, took their station at one of those isles which are

called the sijbota, accompanied by the ten Athenian ships.

Their land force was left at the promontory of Leucimna, with

an aid of a thousand heavy-armed Zacynthians. .The Co­

rinthians had also ready upon the continent a numerous aid
