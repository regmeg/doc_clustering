THE

PELOPONNESIAN WAR.

BOOK IV.

YEAR VII—BEFORE CHRIST 425.

THE ensuing summer, when the corn was beginning to

ear, ten sail of Syracusan, joined by an equal number of Lo-

erian vessels, at the invitation of the inhabitants, stood away

for Messenein Sicily, and took possession of the place. And

thus Messene revolted from the Athenians. But this event

was chiefly owing to the practices of the Syracusans ; who,

foreseeing that this town might open the way for the re­

duction of Sicily, were greatly afraid lest the Athenians

should get established there, and with augmented forces

pour out from thence upon them. The Locrians assisted out

of enmity to the Rhegians, whom they were desirous to have

it in their power to attack both by land and sea. At the

same time also these Locrians broke in upon the territory of

the Rhegians with their intire force, to deter them from any

attempt to save Messene, and to gratify also those fugitives

from Rhegium, who acted now in combination with them.

For Rhegium had for a long time been embroiled in sedition,

and so was unable to take the field against these invaders,

who for the same reason were more eager to distress them.

When the ravage was compleated, the Locrians marched

their land-forces back, but their ships were stationed on the

guard of Messene. They also were very busy in the equip­

ment of an additional number, which were to repair to that

station, and be ready to move from thence to any future

operations of war.
