344 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR.

" terests, if we would act like men of sense, is this present

" congress opened ; but, to concert the best measures within

" our reach to preserve (if possible) our country from falling,

" and as I judge, in great danger of falling, a sacrifice to

" Athenian ambition. It is to convince you how unneces-

" sary a reunion is, not so much from what I can urge, as

" from the light these very Athenians themselves hold out

" before you. Possessed of a power far superior to any other

" Grecians, here they lie amongst us with a few ships, to note

" down our indiscretions ; and, under the plausible pretext of

" alliance, though with malice lurking in their hearts, they are

" studying to improve them in a specious manner to their own

" advantage. For should war be again our option ; and in it,

" should the assistance of men be accepted, who though un-

" invited would be glad to invade us ; whilst we are harass-

" ing and exhausting one another, and cutting open for these

" Athenians a road to our subjection, it is much to be appre-

" hended that, when once they behold our strength at the

" lowest ebb, they will pay us a visit with more formidable

" armaments, and exert their utmost endeavours to compleat

" our destruction.

" It becomes each party amongst us, provided we know

" what is really our interest, to form alliances and to launch

" into hazardous attempts, rather to acquire what belongs

" to others than to prejudice what themselves at present pos-

" sesi ; and to rest assured that sedition must ruin our seve-

" ral States, nay Sicily itself, of which we the joint possessors

" are ready, are all of us ready to be supplanted by hostile

" treachery, whilst mutually embroiled in our domestic

"quarrels. It is high time we were convinced of this, that

" every individual might be reconciled with his neighbour,

" and community with community, and all in general com-

" bine together to preserve the whole ot Sicily; that our

" ears be deaf to the mischievous suggestions, that those

" amongst us of Doric descent are enemies to every thing
