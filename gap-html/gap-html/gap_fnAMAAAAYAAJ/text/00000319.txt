B. II. 205 YEAR III. BEFORE CHRIST 429.

Apollo, by an oracle, made a grant of this land to Alcmaeon

the son of Amphiaraus, when a vagabond, after the murder

of his mother, telling him, that " he never should be freed

" from the terrors that haunted him, till he found a place for

" his residence, which at the time he slew his mother had

" never been seen by the sun, and then was not land ;" be足

cause every other part of the earth was polluted by the par足

ricide. After great perplexities, he at length, as it is said,

discovered these rising heaps of sand at the mouth of the

Achelous, and thought enough cast up to suffice for his sup足

port, after the long course of wandering about to which he

had been necessitated ever since he murdered his mother.

Fixing therefore his residence in the parts about the Oeniadae,

he grew powerful, and left to the whole country the name of

Acarnania from his son Acarnas. This account of Alcmaeon

we have given exactly as we have received it from tradition.

The Athenians and Phormio weighing from Acarnania,

and touching again at Naupactus, very early in the spring

returned to Athens. Thither they brought all the freemen

whom they had made prisoners in the late naval engage足

ments (these were afterwards exchanged man for man) and

the ships taken from the enemy.

And thus the winter ended, and with it the third year of

the war, the history of which hath been compiled by Thucy-

dides.
