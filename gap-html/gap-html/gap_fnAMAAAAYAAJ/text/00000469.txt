the victory might declare. In both these respects, they

judged their present posture the most judicious ; because it

was not their own business to attack, or voluntarily to run into

conflict and danger; and thus having manifestly exhibited

their alacrity to act defensively, a victory might justly be as­

cribed to them without the expence of a battle. In re­

gard further to the Megareans the consequence could not

but be fortunate: For, in case the latter had never beheld

them thus prompt in their succour, they would have stopped

all farther risk, and so undoubtedly they should have lost

the city, as men completely vanquished: But now, should

the Athenians decline an engagement, the points for which

they themselves came thither must be secured without a blow ;

which proved to be the result. For the MegarCans, when

the Athenians came out and drew up in order close to the

long walls, and then, as the enemy did not advance to at­

tack them, stood quiet in their ranks ; their commanders also

judging the hazard by no means equal, and themselves, who

had so far been successful, not at all concerned to begin an

engagement against superior numbers, in which, should

they prevail, they could only take Megara; but, should they

miscarry, must lose the flower of their domestic strength,

especially as their opponents would act in probability with

more daring resolution, since, as the large strength they had

now in the field consisted only of quotas from several con­

stituents, they hazarded but little ; thus facing one another

for a considerable space, and neither side presuming to make

an attack, till each at length wheeled off, the Athenians first

towards Nisaea, and the Peloponnesians again to their for­

mer post.—Then, I say, the Megareans in the interest of the

exiles, regarding Brasidas as victor, aud animated by the

refusal of attack on the Athenian 'side, open the gates of

Megara to Brasidas himself, and the several commanders

from the auxiliary states; and, having given them admission,

proceed with them to consultation, whilst the partizans of

the Athenian interest were in the utmost consternation.
