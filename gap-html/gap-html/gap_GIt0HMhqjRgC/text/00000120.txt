100 THE DECLINE AND FALL

chap. degrees, of the polar circle. Among their southern

xxxv> conquests, the most splendid was that of the Neptha-

lites or white Huns, a polite and warlike people, who

possessed the commercial cities of Bochara and Sa-

marcand, who had vanquished the Persian monarch,

and carried their victorious arms along the banks,

and perhaps to the mouth, of the Indus. On the

side of the west, the Turkish cavalry advanced to the

lake Maeotis. They passed that lake on the ice. The

khan, who dwelt at the foot of mount Altai, issued

his commands for the siege of Bosphorus, a city, the

voluntary subject of Rome, and whose princes had

formerly been the friends of Athens. To the east,

the Turks invaded China, as often as the vigour of

the government was relaxed: and I am taught to

read in the history of the times, that they mowed

down their patient enemies like hemp or grass; and

that the mandarins applauded the wisdom of an em足

peror who repulsed these Barbarians with golden

lances. This extent of savage empire compelled the

Turkish monarch to establish three subordinate

princes of his own blood, who soon forgot their gra足

titude and allegiance. The conquerors were ener足

vated by luxury, which is always fatal except to an

industrious people; the policy of China solicited the

vanquished nations to resume their independence;

and the power of the Turks was limited to a period

of two hundred years. The revival of their name

and dominion in the southern countries of Asia, are

the events of a later age; and the dynasties, which

succeeded to their native realms, may sleep in obli足

vion; since their history bears no relation to the

decline and fall of the Roman empire.

The Avars In the rapid career of conquest, the Turks attacked

the Turks, and subdued the nation of the Ogors or Varchonites
