OF THE ROMAN EM PIKE. 371

field. They acknowledged, that on this occasion it *

was less difficult to kill than to discomfit the soldiers

of Chosroes; amidst the bodies of their friends, no

more than two bowshot from the enemy, the rem­

the anguish of those wounds, which he had so often

indicted on the provinces of the empire; and justice

might allow the excuse, if the desolation had been

confined to the works of regal luxury, if national

hatred, military licence, and religious zeal, had not

wasted with equal rage the habitations and the

temples of the guiltless subject. The recovery of

three hundred Roman standards, and the deliver­

his march within a few miles of Modian or Ctesi-

phon, till he was stopped, on the banks of the Arba,

uy the difficulty of the passage, the rigour of the

season, and perhaps the fame of an impregnable
