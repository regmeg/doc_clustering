The conflict of Rome and Persia was prolonged

from the death of Crassus to the reign of Heraclius.

An experience of seven hundred years might con­

vince the rival nations of the impossibility of main­

taining their conquests beyond the fatal limits of the

Tigris and Euphrates. Yet the emulation of Trajan

and Julian was awakened by the trophies of Alex­

ander, and the sovereigns of Persia indulged the

ambitious hope of restoring the empire of Cyrus.

Such extraordinary efforts of power and courage will

always command the attention of posterity; but the

events by which the fate of nations is not materially

changed leave a faint impression on the page of

history, and the patience of the reader would be

exhausted by the repetition of the same hostilities,

undertaken without cause, prosecuted without glory,

and terminated without effect. The arts of negotia­

tion, unknown to the simple greatness of the senate

and the Caesars, were assiduously cultivated by the

Byzantine princes; and the memorials of their per­

petual embassies* repeat, with the same uniform

prolixity, the language of falsehood and declamation,

by the order of Constantine Porphyrogenitus.
