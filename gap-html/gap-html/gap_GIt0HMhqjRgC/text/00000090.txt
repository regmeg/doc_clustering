70 THE DECLINE AND FALL

chap. was no longer remembered; the despair and death _ of that valiant
officer were secretly imputed to the

revenge of Antonina; and each of his colleagues,

conscious of the same rapine, was apprehensive of the

same fate. The fear of a common enemy suspended

the effects of their envy and discontent; but, in the

confidence of approaching victory, they instigated a

powerful rival to oppose the conqueror of Rome and

The eunuch Africa. From the domestic service of the palace, and

the administration of the private revenue, Narses the

eunuch was suddenly exalted to the head of an army;

and the spirit of a hero, who afterwards equalled the

merit and glory of Belisarius, served only to perplex

the operations of the Gothic war. To his prudent

counsels the relief of Rimini was ascribed by the

leaders of the discontented faction, who exhorted

Narses to assume an independent and separate com足

mand. The epistle of Justinian had indeed enjoined

his obedience to the general; but the dangerous ex足

ception, "as far as may be advantageous to the pub-

_ "lie service," reserved some freedom of judgment

to the discreet favourite, who had so lately departed

from the sacred and familiar conversation of his sove足

reign. In the exercise of this doubtful right, the

eunuch perpetually dissented from the opinions of

Belisarius; and, after yielding with reluctance to the

siege of Urbino, he deserted his colleague in the

night, and marched away to the conquest of the

iEmelian province. The fierce and formidable bands

of the Heruli were attached to the person of Narses;

ten thousand Romans and confederates were per足

suaded to march under his banners; every malecon-

tent embraced the fair opportunity of revenging his

private or imaginary wrongs; and the remaining

troops of Belisarius were divided and dispersed from

the garrisons of Sicily to the shores of the Hadriatic.
