OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 151

mities of a future siege, to deprive the Romans of

the arts of defence, and to decide the tedious quarrel

of the two nations, by an equal and honourable con­

flict in the field of battle. The Roman captives and

deserters were tempted to inlist in the service of a

liberal and courteous adversary; the slaves were at­

tracted by the firm and faithful promise, that they

should never be delivered to their masters; and from

the thousand warriors of Pavia, a new people, under

the same appellation of Goths, was insensibly formed

in the camp of Totila. He sincerely accomplished

the articles of capitulation, without seeking or ac­

cepting any sinister advantage from ambiguous ex­

pressions or unforeseen events: the garrison of Na­

ples had stipulated, that they should be transported

by sea; the obstinacy of the winds prevented their

voyage, but they were generously supplied with

horses, provisions, and a safe conduct to the gates of

Rome. The wives of the senators, who had been

surprised in the villas of Campania, were restored,

without a ransom, to their husbands; the violation

of female chastity was inexorably chastised with

death; and, in the salutary regulation of the diet of

the famished Neapolitans, the conqueror assumed the

office of a humane and attentive physician. The vir­

tues of Totila are equally laudable, whether they pro­

ceeded from true policy, religious principle, or the

instinct of humanity: he often harangued his troops;

and it was his constant theme, that national vice and

ruin are inseparably connected; that victory is the

fruit of moral as well as military virtue; and that

the prince, and even the people, are responsible for

the crimes which they neglect to punish.
