OE THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

He survived this impious menace; sailed into the chap

mouth of the Danube; trusted his person in the'

loyal village of the Bulgarians, and purchased the aid

ofTerbelis, a pagan conqueror, by the promise of his

daughter and a fair partition of the treasures of the

empire. The Bulgarian kingdom extended to the

confines of Thrace; and the two princes besieged

universal defection which he had once experienced

might provoke him to repeat the wish of Caligula,

that the Roman people had but one head: yet I shall

presume to observe, that such a wish is unworthy of

an ingenious tyrant, since his revenge and cruelty
