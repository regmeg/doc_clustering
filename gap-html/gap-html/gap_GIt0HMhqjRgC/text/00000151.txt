by additional bulwarks. In this important fortress,

the vigilance of Chosroes had deposited a magazine

of offensive and defensive arms, sufficient for five

and of grain from whence a strong liquor was ex­

slender and temporary props, hung tottering in the

air; but Dagisteus delayed the attack till he had

exempt from sickness or wounds; yet such had been

their inflexible perseverance, that they concealed

bodies of their eleven hundred companions. After

their deliverance, the breaches were hastily stopped

with sand-bags; the mine was replenished with earth;

timber; and a fresh garrison of three thousand men

was stationed at Petra to sustain the labours of a

each party derived useful lessons from the experience

of their past faults. A battering ram was invented,

of light construction and powerful effect; it was
