192 THE DECLINE AND FALL

xxxvr.

chap. period expires in the year six hundred and eighteen;

a date that exactly agrees with the tremendous comet

of the Sibyl, and perhaps of Pliny, which arose in

the West two generations before the reign of Cyrus.

The fourth apparition, forty-four years before the

birth of Christ, is of all others the most splendid and

important. After the death of Caesar, a long-haired

star was conspicuous to Rome and to the nations,

during the games which were exhibited by young

Octavian in honour of Venus and his uncle. The

vulgar opinion, that it conveyed to heaven the divine

soul of the dictator, was cherished and consecrated

by the piety of a statesman: while his secret su­

perstition referred the comet to the glory of his own

times. The Jiflh visit has been already ascribed to

the fifth year of Justinian, which coincides with the

five hundred and thirty-first of the Christian sera.

And it may deserve notice, that in this, as in the

preceding instance, the comet was followed, though

at a longer interval, by a remarkable paleness of the

sun. The sixth return, in the year eleven hundred

and six, is recorded by the chronicles of Europe and

China; and in the first fervour of the Crusades, the

Christians and the Mahometans might surmise, with

equal reason, that it portended the destruction of the

Infidels. The seventh phenomenon of one thousand

six hundred and eighty was presented to the eyes of

an enlightened age. The philosophy of Bayle dis­

pelled a prejudice which Milton,s muse had so re­

cently adorned, that the comet, " from its horrid hair

"shakes pestilence and war." Its road in the heavens

was observed with exquisite skill by Flamstead and

Cassini; and the mathematical science of Bernoulli,

Newton, and Halley, investigated the laws of its re­

volutions. At the eighth period, in the year two

thousand two hundred and fifty-five, their calcula­

tions may perhaps be verified by the astronomers of
