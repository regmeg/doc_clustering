OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 489

of seamen to the Imperial fleet. Since the time of chap.

the Peloponesian and Punic wars, the sphere of ac-'

tion had not been enlarged; and the science of naval

architecture appears to have declined. The art of

constructing those stupendous machines which dis­

played three, or six, or ten, ranges of oars, rising

above, or falling behind, each other, was unknown to

the ship-builders of Constantinople, as well as to the

mechanicians of modern days. The Dromones, or

light galleys of the Byzantine empire, were content

with two tier of oars; each tier was composed of five

and twenty benches ; and two rowers were seated on

each bench, who plyed their oars on either side of

the vessel. To these we must add the captain or

centurion, who, in time of action, stood erect with

his armour-bearer on the poop, two steersmen at the

helm, and two officers at the prow, the one to manage

the anchor, the other to point and play against the

enemy the tube of liquid fire. The whole crew, as

in the infancy of the art, performed the double service

of mariners and soldiers; they were provided with

defensive and offensive arms, with bows and arrows,

which they used from the upper deck, with long

pikes, which they pushed through the port-holes of

the lower tier. Sometimes indeed the ships of war

were of a larger and more solid construction; and

the labours of combat and navigation were more

regularly divided between seventy soldiers and two

hundred and thirty mariners. But for the most part

they were of the light and manageable size; and as

the cape of Malea in Peloponesus was still clothed

with its ancient terrors, an Imperial fleet was trans­

ported five miles over land across the Isthmus of

Corinth. The principles of maritime tactics had not

undergone any change since the time of Thucydides:

a squadron of galleys still advanced in a crescent,

charged to the front, and strove to impel their sharp
