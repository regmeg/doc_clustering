198 THE DECLINE AND FALL

chap. the universal corruption of the air, that the pestilence

YYYVt

1 which burst forth in the fifteenth year of Justinian

was not checked or alleviated by any difference of the

seasons. In time, its first malignity was abated and

dispersed; the disease alternately languished and re­

vived; but it was not till the end of a calamitous

period of fifty-two years, that mankind recovered their

health, or the air resumed its pure and salubrious

quality. No facts have been preserved to sustain an

account, or even a conjecture, of the numbers that

perished in this extraordinary mortality. I only

find, that during three months, five, and at length

ten thousand persons, died each day at Constanti­

nople; that many cities of the East were left vacant,

and that in several districts of Italy the harvest and

the vintage withered on the ground. The triple

scourge of war, pestilence, and famine, afflicted the

subjects of Justinian; and his reign is disgraced by a

visible decrease of the human species, which has never

been repaired in some of the fairest countries of the

globe.
