OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 33

they entertain a hope, or even a wish, of returning'

to the banks of the Elbe, where their brethren, of a

spirit less adventurous, still wandered in their native

forests. It was impossible for cowards to surmount

the barriers of unknown seas and hostile Barbarians:

it was impossible for brave men to expose their

nakedness and defeat before the eyes of their

countrymen, to describe the kingdoms which they

had lost, and to claim a share of the humble

might indicate their descent from one common stock

with the conquerors of Africa: but the use of a

Sclavonian dialect more clearly represents them as

the last remnant of the new colonies, who succeeded

to the genuine Vandals, already scattered or de­

Africa from an enemy more barbarous than the

Vandals. The origin of the Moors is involved in

darkness: they were ignorant of the use of letters.

Their limits cannot be precisely defined: a boundless

continent was open to the Libyan shepherds; the

change of seasons and pastures regulated their mo­

tions; and their rude huts and slender furniture .
