Contagion is the inseparable symptom of the^et^nand

plague; which, by mutual respiration, is transfused a. d. 542

from the infected persons to the lungs and stomach ~~

of those who approach them. While philosophers

believe and tremble, it is singular, that the existence

of a real danger should have been denied by a people

most prone to vain and imaginary terrors. Yet the

fellow-citizens of Procopius were satisfied, by some

short and partial experience, that the infection could

not be gained by the closest conversation; and this

persuasion might support the assiduity of friends or

physicians in the care of the sick, whom inhuman

prudence would have condemned to solitude and

despair. But the fatal security, like the predestina足

the contagion, and those salutary precautions to which

Europe is indebted for her safety were unknown to

the government of Justinian. No restraints were

imposed on the free and frequent intercourse of the

Roman provinces; from Persia to France, the na足

tions were mingled and infected by wars and emi足

grations: and the pestilential odour which lurks for

years in a bale of cotton was imported, by the abuse

of trade, into the most distant regions. The mode

of its propagation is explained by the remark of Pro足

coast to the inland country; the most sequestered

islands and mountains were successively visited; the

places which had escaped the fury of its first passage

its reception, the plague would soon expire in the

cold or temperate climates of the earth. Such was
