OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 35

lutions; and the menace of their female prophets

was repeatedly fulfilled, that the Moors should be

the cattle now graze in the midst of an amphitheatre,

under the shade of Corinthian columns. A sharp

craggy clifts and inhospitable natives of mount Au­

A citadel was erected to secure this important con­

and as Solomon pursued his march to the West, the

long-lost province of Mauritanian Sitifi was again
