60 THE DECLINE AND FALL

chap. of contending with their adversaries, whose lances

XXXIV- and arrows, at a distance, or at hand, were alike for­

midable. The consummate skill of Belisarius em­

braced the favourable opportunities: and as he chose

the ground and the moment, as he pressed the charge

or sounded the retreat, the squadrons which he de­

tached were seldom unsuccessful. These partial ad­

vantages diffused an impatient ardour among the

soldiers and people, who began to feel the hardships

of a siege, and to disregard the dangers of a general

engagement. Each plebeian conceived himself to be

a hero; and the infantry, who, since the decay of dis­

cipline, were rejected from the line of battle, aspired

to the ancient honours of the Roman legion. Beli­

sarius praised the spirit of his troops, condemned

their presumption, yielded to their clamours, and

prepared the remedies of a defeat, the possibility of

which he alone had courage to suspect. In the

quarter of the Vatican, the Romans prevailed; and

if the irreparable moments had not been wasted in

the pillage of the camp, they might have occupied

the Milvian bridge, and charged in the rear of the

Gothic host. On the other side of the Tyber, Beli­

sarius advanced from the Pincian and Salarian gates.

But his army, four thousand soldiers perhaps, was

lost in a spacious plain; they were encompassed and

oppressed by fresh multitudes, who continually re­

lieved the broken ranks of the Barbarians. The

valiant leaders of the infantry were unskilled to con­

quer; they died: the retreat (a hasty retreat) was

covered by the prudence of the general, and the

victors started back with affright from the formidable

aspect of an armed rampart. The reputation of

Belisarius was unsullied by a defeat; and the vain

confidence of the Goths was not less serviceable to

his designs, than the repentance and modesty of the

Roman troops.
