the resistance of Diocletianopolis and Beraea, of'

Philippopolis and Adrianople, soon exhausted the

skill and patience of the besiegers. The warfare of

Baian was that of a Tartar, yet his mind was sus­

ceptible of a humane and generous sentiment; he

spared Anachialus, whose salutary waters had re­

stored the health of the best beloved of his wives;

and the Romans confess, that their starving army was

fed and dismissed by the liberality of a foe. His em­

pire extended over Hungary, Poland, and Prussia,

from the mouth of the Danube to that of the Oder;

and his new subjects were divided and transplanted

by the jealous policy of the conqueror*. The eastern

regions of Germany, which had been left vacant by

the emigration of the Vandals, were replenished with

Sclavonian colonists; the same tribes are discovered

in the neighbourhood of the Adriatic and of the

Baltic; and with the name of Baian himself, the

Illyrian cities of Neyss and Lissa are again found in

the heart of Silesia. In the disposition both of his

troops and provinces, the chagan exposed the vassals,

whose lives he disregarded, to the first assault; and

the swords of the enemy were blunted before they

encountered the native valour of the Avars.

The Persian alliance restored the troops of the Warsof

East to the defence of Europe; and Maurice, who agrinsuhe

had supported ten years the insolence of the chagan, jf™

declared his resolution to march in person against the — 602

Barbarians. In the space of two centuries, none of

the successors of Theodosius had appeared in the

field, their lives were supinely spent in the palace of

Constantinople; and the Greeks could no longer

understand, that the name of emperor, in its primitive

sense, denoted the chief of the armies of the republic.
