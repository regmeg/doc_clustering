370 THE DECLINE AND FALL

chap. oriental metaphor, to describe the men and arms,

XXXIX- the horses and elephants, ,that covered Media and

Assyria against the invasion of Heraclius. Yet the

Romans boldly advanced from the Araxes to the

Tigris, and the timid prudence of Rhazates was con­

tent to follow them by forced marches through a de­

and despair through the fainting ranks of the Per­

sians. His armour of pure and massy gold, the shield

of one hundred and twenty plates, the sword and

belt, the saddle and cuirass, adorned the triumph of

Heraclius, and the champion of Rome might have

offered the fourth up/me spoils to the Jupiter of the

capitol. In the battle of Nineveh, which was fiercely

fought from daybreak to the eleventh hour, twenty-

eiglit standards, beside those which might be broken

or torn, were taken from the Persians; the greatest

part of their army was cut in pieces, and the victors,
