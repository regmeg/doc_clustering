398 THE DECLINE AND FALL

chap. still cherished the pride of his birth, and the hope of

XL- his restoration. After three years' exile, he received

the pleasing intelligence that his injury was avenged

by a second revolution; and that Leontius in his

turn had been dethroned and mutilated by the rebel

Apsimar, who assumed the more respectable name of

Tiberius. But the claim of lineal succession was still

formidable to a plebeian usurper; and his jealousy

was stimulated by the complaints and charges of the

Chersonites, who beheld the vices of the tyrant in the

spirit of the exile. With a band of followers, attached

to his person by common hope or common despair,

Justinian fled from the inhospitable shore to the horde

of the Chozars, who pitched their tents between the

Tanais and Borysthenes. The khan entertained

with pity and respect the royal suppliant. Phana-

goria, once an opulent city on the Asiatic side of the

lake Maoris, was assigned for his residence; and

every Roman prejudice was stifled in his marriage

with the sister of the Barbarian, who seems, however,

from the name of Theodora, to have received the sa­

crament of baptism. But the faithless Chozar was

soon tempted by the gold of Constantinople; and

had not the design been revealed by the conjugal

love of Theodora, her husband must have been assas­

sinated, or betrayed into the power of his enemies.

After strangling, with his own hands, the two emis­

saries of the khan, Justinian sent back his wife to

her brother, and embarked on the Euxine, in search

of new and more faithful allies. His vessel was

assaulted by a violent tempest; and one of his pious

companions advised him to deserve the mercy of

God by a vow of general forgiveness, if he should be

restored to the throne. "Of forgiveness!" replied

the intrepid tyrant; "may I perish this instant!

"may the Almighty whelm me in the waves, if I

"consent to spare a single head of my enemies!"
