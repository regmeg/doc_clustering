5i THE DECLINE AND FALL

chap. horse, a bay, with a white face, which he rode on

XXXIV- that memorable day. "Aim at the bay horse !" was

the universal cry. Every bow was bent, every ja­

velin was directed, against that fatal object, and the

command was repeated and obeyed by thousands who

were ignorant of its real motive. The bolder Bar­

barians advanced to the more honourable combat of

swords and spears; and the praise of an enemy has

graced the fall of Visandus, the standard-bearer, who

maintained his foremost station, till he was pierced

with thirteen wounds, perhaps by the hand of Beli­

sarius himself. The Roman general was strong,

active, and dexterous: on every side he discharged

his weighty and mortal strokes: his faithful guards

imitated his valour, and defended his person; and

the Goths, after the loss of a thousand men, fled be­

fore the arms of a hero. They were rashly pursued

to their camp; and the Romans, oppressed by mul­

titudes, made a gradual, and at length a precipitate

retreat to the gates of the city: the gates were shut

against the fugitives; and the public terror was in­

creased, by the report, that Belisarius was slain.

His countenance was indeed disfigured by sweat,

dust, and blood; his voice was hoarse, his strength

was almost exhausted; but his unconquerable spirit

still remained: he imparted that spirit to his de­

sponding companions; and their last desperate charge

was felt by the flying Barbarians, as if a new army,

vigorous and entire, had been poured from the city.

The Flaminian gate Was thrown open to a real tri­

umph; but it was not before Belisarius had visited

every post, and provided for the public safety, that

he could be persuaded by his wife and friends to

taste the needful refreshments of food and sleep. In

the more improved state of the art of war, a general

is seldom required or even permitted to display the

Valour of

Belisarius.
