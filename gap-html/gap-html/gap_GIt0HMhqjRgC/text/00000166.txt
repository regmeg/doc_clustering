146 THE DECLINE AND FALL

chap. "chastisement of perjury and the vindication of their

XXXV1, "own honour." Their honour was vindicated in the

field of Tebeste, by the death of Solomon, and the

total loss of his army. The arrival of fresh troops

and more skilful commanders soon checked the in­

solence of the Moors; seventeen of their princes

were slain in the same battle; and the doubtful and

transient submission of their tribes was celebrated

with lavish applause by the people of Constantinople.

Successive inroads had reduced the province of Africa

to one third of the measure of Italy; yet the Roman

emperors continued to reign above a century over

Carthage, and the fruitful coast of the Mediterranean.

But the victories and the losses of Justinian were

alike pernicious to mankind; and such was the de­

solation of Africa, that in many parts a stranger

might wander whole days without meeting the face

either of a friend or an enemy. The nation of the

Vandals had disappeared; they once amounted to a

hundred and sixty thousand warriors, without in­

cluding the children, the women, or the slaves.

Their numbers were infinitely surpassed by the num­

ber of the Moorish families extirpated in a relentless

war; and the same destruction was retaliated on the

Romans and their allies, who perished by the cli­

mate, their mutual quarrels, and the rage of the

Barbarians. When Procopius first landed, he ad­

mired the populousness of the cities and country,

strenuously exercised in the labours of commerce

and agriculture. In less than twenty years, that

busy scene was converted into a silent solitude; the

wealthy citizens escaped to Sicily and Constantinople;

and the secret historian has confidently affirmed, that

five millions of Africans were consumed by the wars

and government of the emperor Justinian *.

* Procopius, Anecdot. c. 18. The series of the African history attests this  
melancholy truth.
