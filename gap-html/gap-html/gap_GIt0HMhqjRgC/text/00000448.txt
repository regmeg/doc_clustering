and invested the Pontic Heraclea, once a nourishing

sustaining in her antique walls a month's siege against

the forces of the East. The ruin was complete; the

spoil was ample: but if Harun had been conversant

with Grecian story, he would have regretted the

statue of Hercules; whose attributes, the club, the

in massy gold. The progress of desolation by sea

and slain by the Bulgarians; and the advantage of

his death overbalanced, in the public opinion, the

destruction of a Roman army. The warlike tribes

of the Bulgarians in the next century embraced the
