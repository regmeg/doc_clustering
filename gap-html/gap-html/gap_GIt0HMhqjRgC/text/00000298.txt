278 THE DECLINE AND FALL

chap. "brother: they are mingled with those of the vilest

XXXVIIL " animals." The Gepida?, a nation of warriors,

started from their seats, and the fearless Alboin, with

his forty companions, laid their hands on their swords.

The tumult was appeased by the venerable inter­

position of Turisund. He saved his own honour, and

the life of his guest: and after the solemn rites of

investiture, dismissed the stranger in the bloody arms

of his son; the gift of a weeping parent. Alboin

returned in triumph; and the Lombards, who cele­

brated his matchless intrepidity, were compelled to

praise the virtues of an enemy. In this extraordinary

visit he had probably seen the daughter of Cunimund,

who soon after ascended the throne of the Gepidae.

Her name was Rosamond, an appellation expressive

of female beauty, and which our own history or ro­

to the hope of possessing the fair Rosamond, and of

insulting her family and nation. The arts of per­

suasion were tried without success; and the impatient

lover, by force and stratagem, obtained the object of

his desires. War was the consequence which he fore­

saw and solicited; but the Lombards could not long

withstand the furious assaults of the Gepidae, who

were sustained by a Roman army. And as the offer

of marriage was rejected with contempt, Alboin was

compelled to relinquish his prey, and to partake of

the disgrace which he had inflicted on the house of

Cunimund.
