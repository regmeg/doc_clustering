the king of the Lazi, to transplant the people into

some distant land, and to fix a faithful and warlike

colony on the banks of the Phasis. The watchful

jealousy of the Colchians foresaw and averted the

approaching ruin. Their repentance was accepted

city was seated on a craggy rock, which hung over

the sea, and communicated by a steep and narrow

path with the land. Since the approach was difficult,

the attack might be deemed impossible; the Persian
