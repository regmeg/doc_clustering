with authority, may sport with the lives of thousands

which are bravely exposed for the public service.

According to military practice, the bread or biscuit

of the Romans was twice prepared in the oven, and

a diminution of one-fourth was cheerfully allowed

for the loss of weight. To gain this miserable profit,

and to save the expense of wood, the praefect John of

Cappadocia had given orders that the flour should be
