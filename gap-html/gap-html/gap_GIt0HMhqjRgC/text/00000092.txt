72 THE DECLINE AND FAIX

chap. sex, and the more precious spoil, was resigned to the

XXX1v- Burgundians; and the houses, or at least the walls,

Destruction of Milan were levelled with the ground. The Goths,

in their last moments, were revenged by the destruc­

tion of a city, second only to Rome in size and opu­

lence, in the splendour of its buildings, or the number

of its inhabitants; and Belisarius sympathized alone

in the fate of his deserted and devoted friends. En­

couraged by this successful inroad, Theodebert him­

self, in the ensuing spring, invaded the plains of Italy

with an army of one hundred thousand Barbarians.

The king, and some chosen followers, were mounted

on horseback, and armed with lances; the infantry,

without bows or spears, were satisfied with a shield,

a sword, and a double-edged battle-axe, which, in

their hands, became a deadly and unerring weapon.

Italy trembled at the march of the Franks; and both

the Gothic prince and the Roman general, alike ig­

norant of their designs, solicited, with hope and ter­

ror, the friendship of these dangerous allies. Till he

had secured the passage of the Po on the bridge of

Pavia, the grandson of Clovis dissembled his inten­

tions, which he at length declared, by assaulting, al­

most at the same instant, the hostile camps of the

Romans and Goths. Instead of uniting their arms,

they fled with equal precipitation; and the fertile

though desolate provinces of Liguria and iEmilia

were abandoned to a licentious host of Barbarians,

whose rage was not mitigated by any thoughts of

settlement or conquest. Among the cities which

they ruined, Genoa, not yet constructed of marble,

is particularly enumerated: and the deaths of thou­

sands, according to the regular practice of war, appear

to have excited less horror than sacrifices of women

and children, which were performed with impunity

in the camp. If it were not a melancholy truth, that

the first and most cruel sufferings must be the lot of
