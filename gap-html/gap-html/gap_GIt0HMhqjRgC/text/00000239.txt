OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 219

By the perpetual edict, the controversies of the sects chap.

were in a great measure determined. Fpr that im- 1

portant work, the emperor Hadrian preferred the chief

of the Sabinians: the friends of monarchy prevailed;

but the moderation of Salvius Julian insensibly recon­

lives and properties; and the barbarous dialect of the

Latins was imperfectly studied in the academies of

Berytus and Constantinople. As an Illyrian soldier,

that idiom was familiar to the infancy of Justinian;
