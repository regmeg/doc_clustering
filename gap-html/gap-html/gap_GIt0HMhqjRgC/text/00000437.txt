OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 417

and the forces of the invaders were destroyed. An chap.

Exarch was still permitted to reside at Ravenna,'

but he was rather a captive than a ruler; and although

the government of Rome and Italy continued to be

exercised in the name of the successors of Constan-

tine, their authority from this period was rather no­

minal than real. Leo made no farther attempts to

re-establish his power in Italy. He expired peace­

ably, in the palace of Constantinople, after a reign of

twenty-four years; and the purple which he had ac­

quired was transmitted by the right of inheritance to

the third generation.

Constantine the Fifth, surnamed Copronymus, the Constan-

son and successor of Leo, during a long reign of j^f^

thirty-four years, attacked with less temperate zeal A-D- 741-

the images or idols of the church. A synod was held

at Blacharnae, a suburb of Constantinople, which was

composed of three hundred and thirty-eight bishops,

who, after serious deliberation, subscribed an unani­

mous decree, that image worship is a corruption of

Christianity, and a renewal of Paganism; and that

all such monuments of idolatry should be broken or

erased. The East, after many disturbances, obeyed

with reluctance, and the images were removed; but

they were fondly cherished and vigorously defended

by the independent zeal of the Italians. A new

enemy now invaded Romagna. Liutprand, king of

the Lombards, declared himself the champion of the

images; and the Catholics of the Exarchate yielded

without reluctance, and admitted him into Ravenna.

The city was soon afterwards recovered by the forces

of the Venetians; but Astolphus, the successor of

Liutprand, declared himself the equal enemy of the

emperor and the pope, and either by force or trea­

chery made himself master of Ravenna, and this final Ravenna

conquest extinguished the series of the Exarchs, who Lombards.
