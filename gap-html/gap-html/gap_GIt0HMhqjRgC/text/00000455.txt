pellation of Candia. The hundred cities of the age chap.

of Minos were diminished to thirty; and of these, XL'

only one, most probably Cydonia, had courage to re足

tain its freedom and the profession of Christianity.

By the Saracens of Crete the timbers of Mount Ida

were launched into the main, and during an hostile

period of one hundred and thirty-eight years, the

princes of Constantinople attacked these licentious

corsairs with ineffectual arms.

The loss of Sicily was occasioned by an act of ^iof

rigour. An amorous youth, who had stolen a nun a. d.'827

from her cloister, was sentenced by the emperor to

the amputation of his tongue. Euphemius appealed

to the policy of the Saracens of Africa; and soon

returned with the Imperial purple, a fleet of one hun足

dred ships, and an army of seven hundred horse and

ten thousand foot. They landed at Mazara, near the

ruins of the ancient Selinus; but after some partial

victories Syracuse was delivered by the Greeks, the

apostate was slain before her walls, and his African

friends were reduced to the necessity of feeding on

the flesh of their own horses. In their turn they

were relieved by a powerful reinforcement of their

brethren of Andalusia; the largest and western part

of the island was gradually reduced, and the commo足

dious harbour of Palermo was chosen for the seat of the

naval and. military power of the Saracens. Syracuse

preserved above fifty years the faith which she had sworn

to Christ and to Caesar. In the last and fatal siege, her

citizens displayed some remnant of the spirit which had

formerly resisted the powers of Athens and Carthage.

They stood above twenty days against the batter足

ing rams and catapultae, the mines and tortoises of

the besiegers; and the place might have been relieved

if the mariners of the Imperial fleet had not been

detained at Constantinople.
