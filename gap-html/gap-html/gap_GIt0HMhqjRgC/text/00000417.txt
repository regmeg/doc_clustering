OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 897

crimes, and of their patience. In a dark dungeon chap.

Leontius, a general of reputation, had groaned above'

three years, with some of the noblest and most de­

serving of the patricians: he was suddenly drawn

forth to assume the government of Greece; and this

promotion of an injured man was a mark of the con­

tempt, rather than of the confidence, of his prince.

As he was followed to the port by the kind offices of

his friends, Leontius observed, with a sigh, that he

was a victim adorned for sacrifice, and that inevitable

death would pursue his footsteps. They ventured to

reply, that glory and empire might be the recompense

of a generous resolution; that every order of men

abhorred the reign of a monster; and that the hands

of two hundred thousand patriots expected only the

voice of a leader. The night was chosen for their

deliverance; and in the first effort of the conspirators,

the praefect was slain, and the prisons were forced

open: the emissaries of Leontius proclaimed in every

street, " Christians! to St. Sophia;" and the season­

able text of the patriarch, " This is the day of the

"Lord," was the prelude of an inflammatory ser­

mon. From the church the people adjourned to the

hippodrome: Justinian, in whose cause not a sword

had been drawn, was dragged before these tumultuary

judges, and their clamours demanded the instant death

of the tyrant. But Leontius, who was already clothed

with the purple, cast an eye of pity on the prostrate

son of his own benefactor, and of so many emperors.

The life of Justinian was spared; the amputation of

his nose, perhaps of his tongue, was imperfectly per­

formed: the happy flexibility of the Greek language

could impose the name of Rhinotmetus; and the

mutilated tyrant was banished to Chersonae, in Crim

Tartary: a lonely settlement, where corn, wine, and

oil were imported as foreign luxuries. a^d^os
