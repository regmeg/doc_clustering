454 THE DECLINE AND FALL

chap. Basil himself only two could be found who might

XL" be safely intrusted with such dangerous powers; and

they justified his esteem by declining his confidence.

But the serious and successful diligence of the em­

peror established by degrees an equitable balance of

property and payment, of receipt and expenditure;

a peculiar fund was appropriated to each service; and

a public method secured the interest of the prince

and the property of the people. After reforming the

luxury, he assigned two patrimonial estates to supply

the decent plenty, of the Imperial table: the con­

hundred churches that arose by the command of Basil

were consecrated to the devotion of the age. In the

desirous to save, but not afraid to strike: the op­

pressors of the people were severely chastised; but

his personal foes, whom it might be unsafe to pardon,

were condemned, after the loss of their eyes, to a life

of solitude and repentance. The change of language

jurisprudence of Justinian: the voluminous body of

his institutes, pandects, code, and novels, was di­

his son and grandson, must be referred to the ori­
