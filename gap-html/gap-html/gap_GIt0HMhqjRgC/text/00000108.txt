xxxv- virtues were his own, the free gift of nature or re­

flection; he raised himself without a master or a

rival; and so inadequate were the arms committed

to his hand, that his sole advantage was derived from

the pride and presumption of his adversaries. Under

his command, the subjects of Justinian often de­

freedom, was almost totally extinct. The generals,
