OP THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 351

The Persians were equally successful and more for- chap.

tunate in the sack of Caesarea, the capital of Cappa-'

docia; and as they advanced beyond the ramparts

of the frontier, the boundary of ancient war, they

found a less obstinate resistance and a more plentiful

harvest. The pleasant vale of Damascus has been

adorned in every age with a royal city: her obscure

felicity has hitherto escaped the historian of the Ro­

man empire: but Chosroes reposed his troops in the

paradise of Damascus before he ascended the hills

of Libanus, or invaded the cities of the Phoenician

eoast. The conquest of Jerusalem, which had been of Palestine,

meditated by Nushirvan, was achieved by the zeal

and avarice of his grandson; the ruin of the proudest

monument of Christianity was vehemently urged by

the intolerant spirit of the Magi; and he could in-

list, for this holy warfare, an army of six and twenty

thousand Jews, whose furious bigotry might com­

pensate, in some degree, for the want of valour and

discipline. After the reduction of Galilee, and the

region beyond the Jordan, whose resistance appears

to have delayed the fate of the capital, Jerusalem it­

self was taken by assault. The sepulchre of Christ,

and the stately churches of Helena and Constantine,

were consumed, or at least damaged, by the flames;

the devout offerings of three hundred years were

rifled in one sacrilegious day; the patriarch Zacha-

riah, and the true cross, were transported into Persia;

and the massacre of ninety thousand Christians is im­

puted to the Jews and Arabs who swelled the disorder

of the Persian march. The fugitives of Palestine were

entertained at Alexandria by the charity of John the

archbishop, who is distinguished among a crowd of

saints by the epithet of alms-giver: and the revenues

of the church, with a treasure of three hundred thou­

sand pounds, were restored to the true proprietors,

the poor of every country and every denomination.
