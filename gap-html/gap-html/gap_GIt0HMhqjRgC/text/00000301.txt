OF THE KOMAN EMPIRE. 281

Teutonic language, still repeated the songs which chap.

described the heroic virtues, the valour, liberality, XXXVIIL

and fortune of the king of the Lombards. But his

ambition was yet unsatisfied; and the conqueror of

the Gepidae turned his eyes from the Danube to the

richer banks of the Po and the Tyber. Fifteen years

had not elapsed since his subjects, the confederates

of Narses, had visited the pleasant climate of Italy:

the mountains, the rivers, the highways, were familiar

to their memory: the report of their success, perhaps

the view of their spoils, had kindled in the rising

generation the flame of emulation and enterprise.

Their hopes were encouraged by the spirit and elo­

quence of Alboin; and it is affirmed, that he spoke

to their senses, by producing, at the royal feast, the

fairest and most exquisite fruits that grew spon­

taneously in the garden of the world. No sooner

had he erected his standard, than the native strength

of the Lombards was multiplied by the adventurous

youth of Germany and Scythia. The robust pea­

santry of Noricum and Pannonia had resumed the

manners of Barbarians; and the names of the Ge­

pidae, Bulgarians, Sarmatians, and Bavarians, may be

distinctly traced in the provinces of Italy. Of the

Saxons, the old allies of the Lombards, twenty thou­

sand warriors, with their wives and children, accepted

the invitation of Alboin. Their bravery contributed

to his success; but the accession or the absence of

their numbers was not sensibly felt in the magnitude

of his host. Every mode of religion was freely prac­

tised by its respective votaries. The king of the

Lombards had been educated in the Arian heresy;

but the Catholics, in their public worship, were al­

lowed to pray for his conversion; while the more

stubborn Barbarians sacrificed a she-goat, or perhaps

a captive, to the gods of their fathers. The Lom­

bards, and their confederates, were united by their
