xxxv- party, which seemed a multitude in the eyes of the

Romans, penetrated, without opposition, from the

straits of Thermopylae to the isthmus of Corinth;

and the last ruin of Greece has appeared an object

too minute for the attention of history. The works

which the emperor raised for the protection, but at

the expense, of his subjects, served only to disclose

the weakness of some neglected part; and the walls,

which by flattery had been deemed impregnable, were

either deserted by the garrison, or scaled by the Bar­

divided themselves into two bands, • discovered the

weakness and misery of a triumphant reign. They

of Topirus, whose obstinate defence had enraged the

Sclavonians, they massacred fifteen thousand males;

but they spared the women and children; the most

valuable captives were always reserved for labour or

ransom; the servitude was not rigorous, and the
