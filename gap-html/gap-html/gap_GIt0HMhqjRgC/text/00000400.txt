380 THE DECLINE AND FALL

CHAP, arslan to the Loire and Charles Martel, we lose sight of

XXXIX. the immediate subjects of the history. It frequently hap-

~~ pens page after page, and sometimes chapter after chapter,

succeed each other, in which the Greek empire is either en­

tirely unnoticed, or mentioned only in a secondary or very

inferior degree of importance.

I am far from denying that some advantages arise from

the method which Mr. Gibbon has adopted. He has pointed

out several which are entitled to consideration; but whatever

opinion may be formed as to the comparative merit of the

two systems, in the larger works of our author, I think,

there can be no doubt as to the preference which will be

given to an uninterrupted narrative in a history which is so

much contracted. The remainder of this publication will

therefore be conducted on the same plan as the former part

of it.

The history of the Eastern branch of the Roman empire

will be continued without interruption; and, under the

reign of each prince, the reader will find the relation of all

the events of importance which took place during that period.

But although the order in which the historical events are

related is here made to correspond with the time of their

occurrence, the language of the history continues, with a few

exceptions, to be that of the original author. The reader

will still, in the far greater part, peruse the pages of Mr.

Gibbon; but he will read them according to the order of

time in which the events occurred, instead of the trans­

position which the author thought it expedient to adopt in

the ninth and tenth volumes of his history.

The Editor.
