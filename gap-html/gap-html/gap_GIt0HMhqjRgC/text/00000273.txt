OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 253

in the lives of the Romans; and if that nation was chap.

deficient in the more amiable qualities of benevolence xxxvir-

and generosity, they astonished the Greeks by their

sincere and simple performance of the most burthen-

some engagements*. Yet among the same people,

according to the rigid maxims of the patricians and

decemvirs, a naked pact, a promise, or even an oath,

did not create any civil obligation, unless it was con­

firmed by the legal form of a stipulation. Whatever

might be the etymology of the Latin word, it con­

veyed the idea of a firm and irrevocable contract,

which was always expressed in the mode of a question

and answer. Do you promise to pay me one hun­

dred pieces of gold? was the solemn interrogation

of Seius. I do promise—was the reply of Sempro-

nius. The friends of Sempronius, who answered

for his ability and inclination, might be separately

sued at the option of Seius; and the benefit of

partition, or order of reciprocal actions, insensibly

deviated from the strict theory of stipulation. The

most cautious and deliberate consent was justly

required to sustain the validity of a gratuitous pro­

mise; and the citizen who might have obtained a

legal security incurred the suspicion of fraud, and

paid the forfeit of his neglect. But the ingenuity

of the civilians successfully laboured to convert

simple engagements into the form of solemn stipula­

tions. The praetors, as the guardians of social faith,

admitted every rational evidence of a voluntary and

deliberate act, which in their tribunal produced an

equitable obligation, and for which they gave an ac­

tion and a remedy.

contracted by the delivery of a thing, are marked by

• How much is the cool, rational evidence of Polybius (1 . vi. p. 693.1. xxxi.

p. 1459, 1460) superior to vague, indiscriminate applause—omnium maxime ct

pracipue fidem coluit (A. Gellius, xx. 1).
