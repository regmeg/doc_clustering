244- THE DECLINE AND FALL

chap. II. The original right of property can only be

xxxvii. i^stified by the accident or merit of prior occupancy;

ii. Or and on this foundation it is wisely established by the

Right of' philosophy of the civilians. The savage who hollows

property. a tree, inserts a sharp stone into a wooden handle, or

applies a string to an elastic branch, becomes in a

state of nature the just proprietor of the canoe, the

bow, or the hatchet. The materials were common to

all, the new form, the produce of his time and simple

industry, belongs solely to himself. His hungry

brethren cannot, without a sense of their own in­

justice, extort from the hunter the game of the forest

overtaken or slain by his personal strength and dex­

terity. If his provident care preserves and multiplies

the tame animals, whose nature is tractable to the

arts of education, he acquires a perpetual title to the

use and service of their numerous progeny, which

derives its existence from him alone. If he incloses

and cultivates a field for their sustenance and his

own, a barren waste is converted into a fertile soil;

the seed, the manure, the labour, create a new value,

and the rewards of harvest are painfully earned by

the fatigues of the revolving year. In the successive

states of society, the hunter, the shepherd, the hus­

bandman, may defend their possessions by two rea­

sons which forcibly appeal to the feelings of the human

mind: that whatever they enjoy is the fruit of their

own industry; and, that every man who envies their

felicity may purchase similar acquisitions by the exer­

cise of similar diligence. Such, in truth, may be

the freedom and plenty of a small colony cast on a

fruitful island. But the colony multiplies, while the

space still continues the same: the common rights,

the equal inheritance of mankind, are engrossed by

the bold and crafty; each field and forest, is circum­

scribed by the land-marks of a jealous master; and
