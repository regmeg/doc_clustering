432 THE DECLINE AND FALL

chap. inhuman spectacle, and Leo consented with reluct­

ance to a decent respite) but on the vigil of the

feast, his sleepless anxiety prompted him to visit at

the dead of night the chamber in which his enemy

was confined. He beheld him released from his chain,

and stretched on his gaoler's bed in a profound slum­

ber. Leo was alarmed at these signs of security and

intelligence; but, though he retired with silent steps,

his entrance and departure were noticed by a slave,

who lay concealed in a corner of the prison. Under

the pretence of requesting the spiritual aid of a con­

fessor, Michael informed the conspirators, that their

lives depended on his discretion, and that a few hours

were left to assure their own safety, by the deliver­

ance of their friend and country. On the great festi­

vals, a chosen band of priests and chanters was ad­

mitted into the palace by a private gate, to sing

matins in the chapel; and Leo, who regulated with

the same strictness the discipline of the choir and of

the camp, was seldom absent from those early devo­

tions. In the ecclesiastical habit, but with swords

under their robes, the conspirators mingled with the

procession, lurked in the angles of the chapel, and

expected, as the signal of murder, the intonation of

the first psalm by the emperor himself. The im­

perfect light, and the uniformity of dress, might

have favoured his escape, while their assault was

pointed against a harmless priest; but they soon

discovered their mistake, and encompassed on all

sides the royal victim. Without a weapon and with­

out a friend, he grasped a weighty cross, and stood

at bay against the hunters of his life; but as he asked

for mercy, "This is the hour not of mercy but of

vengeance," was the inexorable reply. The stroke

of a well aimed sword separated from his body the

right arm and the cross; and Leo the Armenian was

slain at the foot of the altar.
