OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. H

Belisarius waited five days to receive some Thracian chap.

horses, a military gift of his sovereign. From thence *

the fleet pursued their course through the midst of

the Propontis; but as they struggled to pass the

straits of the Hellespont, an unfavourable wind

detained them four days at Abydus, where the ge­

was fair and moderate, their labours were not un­

successful, and the troops were safely disembarked at

Methonc on the Messenian coast, to repose them­
