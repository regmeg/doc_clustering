102 THE DECLINE AND FALL

chap. above thirty, he had lived above seventy-five years:

xxxv- his mind, as well as his body, was feeble and languid;

and the conqueror of Africa and Italy, careless of the

permanent interest of his people, aspired only to end

his days in the bosom even of inglorious peace. In

a studied oration, he imparted to the senate his re­

solution to dissemble the insult, and to purchase the

friendship of the Avars; and the whole senate, like

the mandarins of China, applauded the incomparable

wisdom and foresight of their sovereign. The in­

struments of luxury were immediately prepared to

captivate the Barbarians; silken garments, soft and

splendid beds, and chains and collars incrusted with

gold. The ambassadors, content with such liberal

reception, departed from Constantinople, and Va­

lentin, one of the emperor's guards, was sent with a

similar character to their camp at the foot of mount

Caucasus. As their destruction or their success must

be alike advantageous to the empire, he persuaded

them to invade the enemies of Rome; and they were

easily tempted, by gifts and promises, to gratify their

ruling inclinations. These fugitives, who fled before

the Turkish arms, passed the Tanais and Borys-

thenes, and boldly advanced into the heart of Po­

land and Germany, violating the law of nations, and

abusing the rights of victory. Before ten years had

elapsed, their camps were seated on the Danube and

the Elbe, many Bulgarian and Sclavonian names were

obliterated from the earth, and the remainder of their

tribes are found, as tributaries and vassals, under the

standard of the Avars. The chagan, the peculiar

title of their king, still affected to cultivate the friend­

ship of the emperor; and Justinian entertained some

thoughts of fixing them in Pannonia to balance the

prevailing power of the Lombards. But the vir­

tue or treachery of an Avar betrayed the secret en­

mity and ambitious designs of their countrymen; and
