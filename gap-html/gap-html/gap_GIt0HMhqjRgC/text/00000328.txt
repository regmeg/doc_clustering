disease arose from the stagnation of the deluge; and

so rapid was the contagion, that fourscore persons

expired in an hour in the midst of a solemn proces­

sion, which implored the mercy of heaven. A society

in which marriage is encouraged and industry pre­

vails soon repairs the accidental losses of pestilence

and war; but as the far greater part of the Romans

was condemned to hopeless indigence and celibacy,

the depopulation was constant and visible, and the

gloomy enthusiasts might expect the approaching

failure of the human race. Yet the number of citi­

zens still exceeded the measure of subsistence: their

precarious food was supplied from the harvests of

Sicily or Egypt; and the frequent repetition of

famine betrays the inattention of the emperor to a

distant province. The edifices of Rome were ex­

posed to the same ruin and decay; the mouldering

fabrics were easily overthrown by inundations, tem­

pests, and earthquakes. It is commonly believed,

that pope Gregory the First attacked the temples

and mutilated the statues of the city; that by the

command of the Barbarian, the Palatine library was

reduced to ashes; and that the history of Livy was

the peculiar mark of his absurd and mischievous

fanaticism. The writings of Gregory himself reveal

his implacable aversion to the monuments of classic

genius. But the evidence of his destructive rage is

doubtful and recent; the Temple of Peace, or the

theatre of Marcellus, have been demolished by the

slow operation of ages; and a formal proscription

would have multiplied the copies of Virgil and Livy

in the countries which were not subject to the

ecclesiastical dictator.
