OP THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 457

"fidels. My brother (a name most offensive to the chap.

"vanity of the Greek), accelerate your naval sue- XL-

"cours, respect your allies, and distrust your flat-

"terers."

These lofty hopes were soon extinguished by the New pro-

death of Lewis, and the decay of the Carlovingian Greeks in

house; and, whoever might deserve the honour, the ^f^' 890

Greek emperors Basil and his son Leo secured the

advantage of the reduction of Bari. The Italians of

Apulia and Calabria were persuaded or compelled to

acknowledge their supremacy, and an ideal line from

Mount Garganus to the bay of Salerno leaves the

far greater part of the kingdom of Naples under the

dominion of the Eastern empire. Beyond that line,

the dukes or republics of Amalfi and Naples, who

had never forfeited their voluntary allegiance, re足

joiced in the neighbourhood of their lawful sove足

reign; and Amalfi was enriched by supplying Europe

with the produce and manufactures of Asia. But

the Lombard princes of Benevento, Salerno, and

Capua, were reluctantly torn from the communion

of the Latin world, and too often violated their oaths

of servitude and. tribute. The city of Bari rose to

dignity and wealth, as the metropolis of the new

theme or province of Lombardy; the title of patri足

cian, and afterwards the singular name of Catapan,

was assigned to the supreme governor; and the po足

licy both of the church and state was modelled in

exact subordination to the throne of Constantinople.

As long as the sceptre was disputed by the princes of

Italy, their efforts were feeble and adverse; and the

Greeks resisted or eluded the forces of Germany

which descended from the Alps under the Imperial

standard of the Othos. The first and greatest of

those Saxon princes was compelled to relinquish the

siege of Bari; the second, after the loss of his stoutest Defeat of

barons, escaped with honour from the bloody field of a.d.983.
