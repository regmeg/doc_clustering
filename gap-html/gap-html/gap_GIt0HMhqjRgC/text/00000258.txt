THE DECLINE AND FALL

chap. number of his children: the domestic judge might

xxxvii. pronounce the death of the offender, or his mercy

m ight expel her from his bed and house: but the

slavery of the wretched female was hopeless and per­

petual, unless he asserted for his own convenience

the manly prerogative of divorce. The warmest ap­

plause has been lavished on the virtue of the Ro­

mans, who abstained from the exercise of this tempt­

ing privilege above five hundred years: but the same

fact evinces the unequal terms of a connexion in

which the slave was unable to renounce her tyrant,

and the tyrant was unwilling to relinquish his slave.

When the Roman matrons became the equal and

voluntary companions of their lords, a new jurispru­

dence was introduced, that marriage, like other part­

nerships, might be dissolved by the abdication of one

of the associates. In three centuries of prosperity

and corruption, this principle was enlarged to fre­

quent practice and pernicious abuse. Passion, in­

terest, or caprice, suggested daily motives for the

dissolution of marriage; a word, a sign, a message,

a letter, the mandate of a freedman, declared the

separation: the most tender of human connexions

was degraded to a transient society of profit or plea­

sure. According to the various conditions of life,

both sexes alternately felt the disgrace and injury:

an inconstant spouse transferred her wealth to a new

family, abandoning a numerous, perhaps a spurious,

progeny to the paternal authority and care of her late

husband; a beautiful virgin might be dismissed to

the world, old, indigent, and friendless; but the re­

luctance of the Romans, when they were pressed to

marriage by Augustus, sufficiently marks, that the

prevailing institutions were least favourable to the

males. A specious theory is confuted by this free

and perfect experiment, which demonstrates, that the

liberty of divorce does not contribute to happiness
