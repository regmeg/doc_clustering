OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 403

command of the praefect John, a general of expe­

rience. The Saracens were now compelled to retire

to Cairoan or Tripoli; but, the following spring(698),

a more numerous army was sent by the caliph, and the

praefect was in his turn compelled to evacuate Car­

Utica: Hassan was victorious; a timely embarkation

preserved the remains of the defeated army; and a

final period was put to the dominion of the Greeks

of Dido lay desolate above two hundred years, till a

part, perhaps a twentieth of the old circumference,

the beginning of the sixteenth century, the second

capital of the West was represented by a mosch, a

college without students, twenty-five or thirty shops,

senators. Even that paltry village was swept away

by the Spaniards whom Charles the Fifth had sta­

thage have perished; and the place might be unknown,

if some broken arches of an aqueduct did not guide

the footsteps of the inquisitive traveller.

Greeks were now expelled, but the Saracens expe­

rienced an obstinate resistance from the Moors, under

the standard of their queen Cahina, who assumed the

character of a prophetess. Hassan was defeated, and
