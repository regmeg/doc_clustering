466 THE DECLINK AND FALL

chap. the subjects of the Byzantine empire were still the

XU- most dexterous and diligent of nations ; their country

was blessed by nature with every advantage of soil,

climate, and situation; and, in the support and re­

storation of the arts, their patient and peaceful temper

was more useful than the warlike spirit and feudal

anarchy of Europe. The provinces that still adhered

to the empire were repeopled and enriched by the

misfortunes of those which were irrecoverably lost.

From the yoke of the caliphs, the Catholics of Syria,

Egypt, and Africa, retired to the allegiance of their

prince, to the society of their brethren: the move­

able wealth, which eludes the search of oppression,

accompanied and alleviated their exile; and Constan­

tinople received into her bosom the fugitive trade of

Alexandria and Tyre. The chiefs of Armenia and

Scythia, who fled from hostile or religious perse­

cution, were hospitably entertained: their followers

were encouraged to build new cities and to cultivate

waste lands; and many spots, both in Europe and

Asia, preserved the name, the manners, or at least,

the memory, of these national colonies. Even the

tribes of Barbarians, who had seated themselves in

arms on the territory of the empire, were gradually

reclaimed to the laws of the church and state; and

as long as they were separated from the Greeks, their

posterity supplied a race of faithful and obedient sol­

diers. Did we possess sufficient materials to survey

the twenty-nine themes of the Byzantine monarchy,

our curiosity might be satisfied with a chosen exam­

ple: it is fortunate enough that the clearest light

should be thrown on the most interesting province,

and the name of Peloponnesus will awaken the at­

tention of the classic reader.
