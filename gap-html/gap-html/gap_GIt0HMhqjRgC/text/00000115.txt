OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 95

their vicinity to the empire; and the level country chap.

of Moldavia and Walachia was occupied by the'

Antes, a Sclavonian tribe, which swelled the titles

of Justinian with an epithet of conquest. Against

the Antes he erected the fortifications of the lower

Danube; and laboured to secure the alliance of a

people seated in the direct channel of northern in­

undation, an interval of two hundred miles between

the mountains of Transylvania and the Euxine sea.

But the Antes wanted power and inclination to stem

the fury of the torrent: and the light-armed Scla-

vonians, from a hundred tribes, pursued with al­

most equal speed the footsteps of the Bulgarian horse.

The payment of one piece of gold for each soldier

procured a safe and easy retreat through the country

of the Gepidae, who commanded the passage of the

upper Danube*. The hopes or fears of the Bar­

barians; their intestine union or discord; the acci­

dent of a frozen or shallow stream; the prospect of

harvest or vintage; the prosperity or distress of the

Romans; were the causes which produced the uni­

form repetition of annual visits, tedious in the nar­

rative, and destructive in the event. The same year,

and possibly the same month, in which Ravenna sur­

rendered, was marked by an invasion of the Huns or

Bulgarians, so dreadful, that it almost effaced the

memory of their past inroads. They spread from

the suburbs of Constantinople to the Ionian gulf,

destroyed thirty-two cities or castles, erased Potidaea,

which Athens had built and Philip had besieged,

and repassed the Danube, dragging at their horses,

heels one hundred and twenty thousand of the sub­

jects of Justinian. In a subsequent inroad they

pierced the wall of the Thracian Chersonesus, ex­

tirpated the habitations and the inhabitants, boldly

traversed the Hellespont, and returned to their com-
