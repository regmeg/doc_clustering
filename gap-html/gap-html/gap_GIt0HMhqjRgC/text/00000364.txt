blished government, but the joyful applause with

which he salutes the fortune of the assassin has sul­

lied with indelible disgrace the character of the

saint. The successor of the apostles might have

inculcated with decent firmness the guilt of blood,

and the necessity of repentance: he is content to

celebrate the deliverance of the people and the fall

of the oppressor; to rejoice that the piety and be­

nignity of Phocas have been raised by Providence to

the Imperial throne; to pray that his hands may be

strengthened against all his enemies; and to express

a wish, that, after a long and triumphant reign, he

may be transferred from a temporal to an everlasting

kingdom. I have already traced the steps of a re­

heaven and earth; and Phocas does not appear less

hateful in the exercise than in the acquisition of

His dm- power. The pencil of an impartial historian has de-

savage temper was inflamed by passion, hardened by

fear, exasperated by resistance or reproach. The

flight of Theodosius to the Persian court had been

intercepted by a rapid pursuit, or a deceitful mes­

sage: he was beheaded at Nice, and the last hours
