OF THE KOMAN EMPIRE. 167

Danube and the rebels of Africa: the first report of chap.

his promotion revived the hopes of the Italians: and XXXVI-

he was privately assured, that a crowd of Roman de足

serters would abandon, on his approach, the standard

of Totila. His second marriage with Malasontha,

the grand-daughter of Theodoric, endeared Ger-

manus to the Goths themselves y and they marched

with reluctance against the father of a royal infant,

the last offspring of the line of Amali. A splendid

allowance was assigned by the emperor: the general

contributed his private fortune; his two sons were

popular and active; and he surpassed, in the prompti足

tude and success of his levies, the expectation of

mankind. He was permitted to select some squa足

drons of Thracian cavalry: the veterans, as well as

the youth of Constantinople and Europe, engaged

their voluntary service; and as far as the heart of

Germany, his fame and liberality attracted the aid of

the Barbarians. The Romans advanced to Sardica;

an army of Sclavonians fled before their march; but

within two days of their final departure, the designs

of Germanus were terminated by his malady and

death. Yet the impulse which he had given to the

Italian war still continued to act with energy and

effect. The maritime towns, Ancona, Crotona,

Centumcelhe, resisted the assaults of Totila. Sicily

was reduced by the zeal of Artaban, and the Gothic

navy was defeated near the coast of the Hadriatic.

The two fleets were almost equal, forty-seven to fifty

galleys: the victory was decided by the knowledge

and dexterity of the Greeks; but the ships were so

closely grappled, that only twelve of the Goths

escaped from this unfortunate conflict. They af足

fected to depreciate an element in which they were

unskilled, but their own experience confirmed the

truth of a maxim, that the master of the sea will

always acquire the dominion of the land.
