122 THE DECLINE AND FALL

chap. Constantinople to the mouth of the Phasis, may be

, _ computed as a voyage of nine days, and a measure of

seven hundred miles. From the Iberian Caucasus,

the most lofty and craggy mountains of Asia, .that

river descends with such oblique vehemence, that in

a short space it is traversed by one hundred and

twenty bridges. Nor does the stream become placid

and navigable, till it reaches the town of Sarapana,

five days' journey from the Cyrus, which flows from

the same hills, but in a contrary direction, to the

Caspian lake. The proximity of these rivers has

suggested the practice, or at least the idea, of waft足

ing the precious merchandise of India down the

Oxus, over the Caspian, up the Cyrus, and with the

current of the Phasis into the Euxine and Mediter足

ranean seas. As it successively collects the streams

of the plain of Colchos, the Phasis moves with di足

minished speed, though accumulated weight. At

the mouth it is sixty fathoms deep and half a league

broad, but a small woody island is interposed in the

midst of the channel: the water, so soon as it has

deposited an earthy or metallic sediment, floats on

the surface of the waves, and is no longer susceptible

of corruption. In a course of one hundred miles,

forty of which are navigable for large vessels, the

Phasis divides the celebrated region of Colchos, or

Mingrelia, which, on three sides, is fortified by the

Iberian and Armenian mountains, and whose mari足

time coast extends about two hundred miles, from

the neighbourhood of Trebizond to Dioscurias, and

the confines of Circassia. Both the soil and climate

are relaxed by excessive moisture: twenty-eight

rivers, besides the Phasis and his dependent streams,

convey their waters to the sea; and the hollowness

of the ground appears to indicate the subterraneous

channels between the Euxine and the Caspian. In

the fields where wheat or barley is sown, the earth
