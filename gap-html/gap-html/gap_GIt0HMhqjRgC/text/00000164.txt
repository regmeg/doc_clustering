144 THE DECLINE AND FALL

chap. as the public disorders were sufficiently mature, Stoza

XXXV1, was again alive, in arms, and at the gates of Carthage.

He fell in a single combat, but he smiled in the

agonies of death, when he was informed that his own

javelin had reached the heart of his antagonist. The

example of Stoza, and the assurance that a fortunate

soldier had been the first king, encouraged the am­

of intestine discord was marked by some deplorable

victory of savage man over civilized society. The

Moors, though ignorant of justice, were impatient of

oppression: their vagrant life and boundless wilder­

ness disappointed the arms, and eluded the chains, of
