chap. placed immediately after the person of the emperor

. XLT- himself. The five titles of 1. Despot; 2. Sebasto-

crator; 3. Ccesar; 4. Panhypersebastor; and, 5.

Protosebastos; were usually confined to the princes

of Ms blood: they were the emanations of his ma­

jesty, but as they exercised no regular functions,

their existence was useless, and their authority pre­

carious.

tfi^pakcc But in every monarchy the substantial powers of

the state, government must be divided and exercised by the

army. ministers of the palace and treasury, the fleet and

army. The titles alone can differ; and in the revo­

lution of ages, the counts and praefects, the praator

and quaestor, insensibly descended, while their servants

rose above their heads to the first honours of the state.

1. In a monarchy, which refers every object to the

person of the prince, the care and ceremonies of the

palace form the most respectable department. The

Curopalata, so illustrious in the age of Justinian, was

supplanted by the Protovestiare, whose primitive func­

tions were limited to the custody of the wardrobe.

From thence his jurisdiction was extended over the

numerous menials of pomp and luxury; and he pre­

sided with his silver wand at the public and private

audience. 2. In the ancient system of Constantino,

the name of Logothete, or accountant, was applied

to the receivers of the finances: the principal officers

were distinguished as the Logothetes of the domain,

of the posts, the army, the private and public trea­

sure; and the great Logothete, the supreme guardian

of the laws and revenues, is compared with the chan­

cellor of the Latin monarchies. His discerning eye

pervaded the civil administration; and he was assisted,

in due subordination, by the eparch or praefect of

the city, the first secretary, and the keepers of theprivy

seal, the archives, and the red or purple ink which

was reserved for the sacred signature of the emperor
