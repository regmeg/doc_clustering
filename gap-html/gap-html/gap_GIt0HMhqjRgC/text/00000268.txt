from each other the subordinate branches or families

of the Cornelian or Claudian race: the default of the

agnats, of the same surname, was supplied by the larger

equal succession of independent matrons supported

their pride and luxury, and might transport into a

foreign house the riches of their fathers. While the

maxims of Cato were revered, they tended to per­

petuate in each family a just and virtuous mediocrity:

till female blandishments insensibly triumphed; and

every salutary restraint was lost in the dissolute great­

ness of the republic. The rigour of the decemvirs

was tempered by the equity of the praetors. Their

edicts restored emancipated and posthumous children

to the rights of nature; and upon the failure of the

agnats, they preferred the blood of the cognats to the

name of the gentiles, whose title and character were

insensibly covered with oblivion. The reciprocal in­

heritance of mothers and sons was established in the

Tertullian and Orphitian decrees by the humanity of

the senate. A new and more impartial order was

introduced by the novels of Justinian, who affected

to revive the jurisprudence of the twelve tables.

The lines of masculine and female kindred were con­

founded: the descending, ascending, and collateral

series, was accurately defined; and each degree,
