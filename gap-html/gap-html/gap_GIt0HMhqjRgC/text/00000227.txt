risprudence was reformed by the annual edicts of the

supreme judge, the praetor of the city. As soon as

he ascended his tribunal, he announced by the voice

of the crier, and afterwards inscribed on a white wall,

the rules which he proposed to follow in the decision

of doubtful cases, and the relief which his equity

would afford from the precise rigour of ancient sta­

monarchy was introduced into the republic: the art

of respecting the name, and eluding the efficacy, of

the laws, was improved by successive praetors; sub­

tleties and fictions were invented to defeat the plainest

meaning of the Decemvirs, and where the end was

salutary, the means were frequently absurd. The

secret or probable wish of the dead was suffered to

prevail over the order of succession and the forms of

testaments; and the claimant, who was excluded from

the character of heir, accepted with equal pleasure

from an indulgent praetor the possession of the goods

of his late kinsman or benefactor. In the redress of

private wrongs, compensations and fines were sub­

stituted to the obsolete rigour of the twelve tables;

time and space were annihilated by fanciful supposi­

tions; and the plea of youth, or fraud, or violence,

annulled the obligation, or excused the performance,

of an inconvenient contract. A jurisdiction thus

vague and arbitrary was exposed to the most dan­

gerous abuse; the substance, as well as the form of'

justice, were often sacrificed to the prejudices of

virtue, the bias of laudable affection, and the grosser

seductions of interest or resentment. But the errors

or vices of each praetor expired with his annual office;

such maxims alone as had been approved by reason

and practice were copied by suceeding judges; the

rule of proceeding was defined by the solution of new
