OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 447

dually formed the large and populous suburb of the chap.

Vatican, and their various habitations were distin- .

guished, in the language of the times, as the schools

of the Greeks and Goths, of the Lombards and

Saxons. But this venerable spot was still open to

sacrilegious insult. The enclosing it with walls and

towers exhausted all that authority could supply. The

pious labour of four years was animated in every sea­

worldly passion, may be detected in the name of the

Leonine city, which he bestowed on the Vatican, yet

the pride of the dedication was tempered with Chris­

tian penance and humility.

Among the successors of Nero and Elagabalus,

we have not hitherto found, in the imitation of their

vices, the character of a Roman prince who consi­

dered pleasure as the object of life, and virtue as the

enemy of pleasure.

Whatever might have been the maternal care of

Theodora, in the education of Michael the Third,

her unfortunate son was a king before he was a

man. If the ambitious mother laboured to check the

progress of reason, she could not cool the ebullition

of passion; and her selfish policy was justly repaid

by the contempt and ingratitude of the headstrong

. youth. At the age of eighteen, he rejected her au­

thority, without feeling his own incapacity to govern

the empire and himself. With Theodora, all gravity

and wisdom retired from the court; their place was

supplied by the alternate dominion of vice and folly;

and it was impossible, without forfeiting the public

esteem, to acquire or preserve the favour of the em­

peror. The millions of gold and silver which had

been accumulated for the service of the state were

lavished on the vilest of men, who flattered his pas­

sions, and shared his pleasures; and in a reign of
