chap. the public hatred. His subjects contributed, with

XL" zeal and alacrity, to chastise the guilt and presump­

tion of a province which had usurped the rights of

the senate and people: the young emperor sailed

from the Hellespont with a powerful fleet; and the

legions of Rome and Carthage were assembled under

his standard in the harbour of Syracuse. The defeat

of the Sicilian tyrant was easy, his punishment just,

and his beauteous head was exposed in the hippo­

drome. After pouring this bloody libation on his

father's tomb, Constantine returned to his capital;

and the growth of his young beard during the Sicilian

voyage was announced, by the familiar surname of

Pogonatus, to the Grecian world. But his reign,

like that of his predecessor, was stained with fraternal

discord. On his two brothers, Heraclius and Tibe­

rius, he had bestowed the title of Augustus: an

empty title, for they continued to languish, without

trust or power, in the solitude of the palace. At

their secret instigation, the troops of the Anatolian

theme or province approached the city on the Asiatic

side, demanded for the royal brothers the partition

or exercise of sovereignty, and supported their sedi­

tious claim by a theological argument. The emperor

invited these learned divines to a friendly conference,

in which they might propose their arguments to the

senate: they obeyed the summons, but the prospect

of their bodies hanging on the gibbet in the suburb

of Galata reconciled their companions to the unity

of the reign of Constantine. He pardoned his bro­

thers, and their names were still pronounced in the

public acclamations; but on the repetition, or suspi­

cion, of a similar offence, the obnoxious princes were

deprived of their titles and noses, in the presence of

the Catholic bishops, who were assembled at Con­

stantinople in the sixth general synod.
