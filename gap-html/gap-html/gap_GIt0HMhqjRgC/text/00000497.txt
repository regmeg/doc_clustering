OF THE ROMAN EMPIJIK. 477

XLI.

a new and supereminent dignity. The happy flexi­

bility of the Greek tongue allowed him to compound

the names of Augustus and emperor (Sebastos and

Autocrator), and the union produced the sonorous

title of Sebastocrator. He was exalted above the

Caesar on the first step of the throne: the public

acclamations repeated his name; and he was only

distinguished from the sovereign by some peculiar

ornament of the head and feet. The emperor alone

could assume the purple or red buskins, and the

the Persian kings. It was a high pyramidal cap of

cloth or silk, almost concealed by a profusion of pearls

coronets or crowns, the precious gems were more

sparingly distributed. Beside and below the Caesar,

the fancy of Alexius created the Panhypersebastos

and the Protosebastos, whose sound and signification

will satisfy,a Grecian ear. They imply a superiority

and a priority above the simple name of Augustus;

and this sacred and primitive title of the Roman prince

was degraded to the kinsman and servants of the By­

with fond complacency, this artful gradation of hopes

and honours; but the science of words is accessible

to the meanest capacity; and this vain dictionary was

easily enriched by the pride of his successors. To

their favourite sons or brothers they imparted the

more lofty appellation of Lord or Despot, which was

illustrated with new ornaments and prerogatives, and
