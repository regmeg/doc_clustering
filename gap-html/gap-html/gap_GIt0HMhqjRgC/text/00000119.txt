the air, the fire, the water, and the earth; and their

priests derived some profit from the art of divination.

Their unwritten laws were rigorous and impartial:

theft was punished by a tenfold restitution : adultery,

treason, and murder, with death: and no chastise­

inexpiable guilt of cowardice. As the subject na­

cavalry, both men and horses, were proudly computed

by millions; one of their effective armies consisted

of four hundred thousand soldiers, and in less than

fifty years they were connected in peace and war

with the Romans, the Persians, and the Chinese.

In their northern limits, some vestige may be disco­

people of hunters and fishermen, whose sledges were

their extreme progress within three, or at least ten
