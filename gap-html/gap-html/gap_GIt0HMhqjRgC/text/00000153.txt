OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 138

troops of Justinian were more frequent and splendid; chap-

but the forces of the great king were continually xxxv-

supplied, till they amounted to eight elephants and

seventy thousand men, including twelve thousand

Scythian allies, and above three thousand Dilemites,

who descended by their free choice from the hills of

Hyrcania, and were equally formidable in close or in

distant combat. The siege of Archaeopolis, a name

imposed or corrupted by the Greeks, was raised with

some loss and precipitation; but the Persians oc­

cupied the passes of Iberia: Colchos was enslaved by

their forts and garrisons; they devoured the scanty

sustenance of the people; and the prince of the Lazi

fled into the mountains. In the Roman camp, faith

and discipline were unknown; and the independent

leaders, who were invested with equal power, disputed

with each other the pre-eminence of vice and cor­

ruption. The Persians followed, without a murmur,

the commands of a single chief, who implicitly obeyed

the instructions of their supreme lord. Their general

was distinguished among the heroes of the East, by

his wisdom in council, and his valour in the field. The

advanced age of Mermeroes, and the lameness of both

his feet, could not diminish the activity of his mind,

or even of his body; and whilst he was carried in a

litter in the front of battle, he inspired terror to the

enemy, and a just confidence to the troops, who,

under his banners, were always successful. After his

death, the command devolved to Nacoragan, a proud

satrap, who, in conference with the Imperial chiefs,

had presumed to declare that he disposed of victory

as absolutely as of the ring on his finger. Such pre­

sumption was the natural cause and forerunner of a

shameful defeat. The Romans had been gradually

repulsed to the edge of the sea-shore; and their last

camp, on the ruins of the Grecian colony of Phasis,

was defended on all sides by strong intrenchments,
