402 THE DECLINE AND FALL

XLI.

chap. and, as a medium between the extremes of four and

sixteen, the foot-soldiers of Leo and Constantine

were formed eight deep; but the cavalry charged in

four ranks, from the reasonable consideration, that

the weight of the front could not be increased by

any pressure of the hindmost horses. If the ranks

of the infantry or cavalry were sometimes doubled,

this cautious array betrayed a secret distrust of the

courage of the troops, whose numbers might swell

the appearance of the line, but of whom only a

chosen band would dare to encounter the spears and

swords of the Barbarians. The order of battle must

have varied according to the ground, the object, and

the adversary; but their ordinary disposition, in two

lines and a reserve, presented a succession of hopes

and resources most agreeable to the temper as well as

the judgment of the Greeks. In case of a repulse,

the first line fell back into the intervals of the second;

and the reserve, breaking into two divisions, wheeled

round the flanks to improve the victory or cover the

retreat. Whatever authority could enact was accom­

plished, at least in theory, by the camps and marches,

the exercises and evolutions, the edicts and books, of

the Byzantine monarch. Whatever art could pro­

duce from the forge, the loom, or the laboratory, was

abundantly supplied by the riches of the prince, and

the industry of his numerous workmen. But neither

authority nor art could frame the most important

machine, the soldier himself; and if the ceremonies

of Constantine always suppose the safe and triumphal

return of the emperor, his tactics seldom soar above

the means of escaping a defeat, and procrastinating

the war. Notwithstanding some transient success,

the Greeks were sunk in their own esteem and that

of their neighbours. A cold hand and a loquacious

tongue was the vulgar description of the nation: the

author of the tactics was besieged in his capital; and
