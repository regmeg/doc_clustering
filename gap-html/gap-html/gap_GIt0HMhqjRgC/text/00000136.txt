116 THE DECLINE AND FALL

chap. missed the ambassador of Justinian to inform his

xxxv- master in what place he had left the enemy of the Ro­

mans. The conqueror still affected the praise of hu­

manity and justice; and as he beheld a noble matron

with her infant rudely dragged along the ground, he

sighed, he wept, and implored the divine justice to

punish the author of these calamities. Yet the herd

of twelve thousand captives was ransomed for two

hundred pounds of gold; the neighbouring bishop of

Sergioplis pledged his faith for the payment; and in

the subsequent year the unfeeling avarice of Chosroes

exacted the penalty of an obligation which it was ge­

nerous to contract and impossible to discharge. He

advanced into the heart of Syria; but a feeble ene­

my, who vanished at his approach, disappointed him

of the honour of victory; and as he could not hope

to establish his dominion, the Persian king displayed

in this inroad the mean and rapacious vices of a rob­

ber. Hierapolis, Berrhaea or Aleppo, Apamea, and

Chalcis, were successively besieged; they redeemed

their safety by a ransom of gold or silver, proportioned

to their respective strength and opulence; and their

new master enforced, without observing, the terms

and ruins of capitulation. No more than fourteen years had

elapsed since Antioch was ruined by an earthquake;

but the queen of the East, the new Theopolis, had

been raised from the ground by the liberality of Jus­

tinian; and the increasing greatness of the buildings

and the people already erased the memory of this re­

cent disaster. On one side, the city was defended

by the mountain, on the other by the river Orontes;

but the most accessible part was commanded by a su­

perior eminence: the proper remedies were rejected,

from the despicable fear of discovering its weakness

to the enemy; and Germanus, the emperor,s nephew,

refused to trust his person and dignity within the

walls of a besieged city. The people of Antioch had

Antioch.
