children) might be recovered by the same action of

was in his own option to compensate the damage, or

resign to the injured party the obnoxious animal.

At the call of indigence or avarice, the master of a

family could dispose of his children or his slaves.

But the condition of the slave was far more advan­

his alienated freedom: the son was again restored to

his unnatural father; he might be condemned to

servitude a second and a third time, and it was not

till after the third sale and deliverance, that he was

enfranchised from the domestic power which had

been so repeatedly abused. According to his discre­

tion, a father might chastise the real or imaginary

faults of his children, by stripes, by imprisonment,

by exile, by sending them to the country to work in

chains among the meanest of his servants. The ma­

jesty of a parent was armed with the power of life

and death*; and the examples of such bloody exe­

cutions, which were sometimes praised and never

punished, may be traced in the annals of Rome, be­

yond the times of Pompey and Augustus. Neither

age, nor rank, nor the consular office, nor the ho­

nours of a triumph, could exempt the most illustrious

citizen from the bonds of filial subjection: his own

descendants were included in the family of their

common ancestor; and the claims of adoption were

not less sacred or less rigorous than those of nature.

Without fear, though not without danger of abuse,

the Roman legislators had reposed an unbounded

confidence in the sentiments of paternal love; and
