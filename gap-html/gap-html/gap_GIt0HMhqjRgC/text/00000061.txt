OF THE KOMAN EMPIRE. 41

rians resented the.indignity which had been offered'

to their king; accused the regent of conspiring

free people. But if she had lamented the disorders

of her son, she soon wept his irreparable loss; and

the death of Athalaric, who, at the age of sixteen,

was consumed by premature intemperance, left her
