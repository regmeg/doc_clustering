Athens? Could they hope that the precepts of

philosophy should direct the life, and control the

passions, of a despot, whose infancy had been taught

to consider his absolute and fluctuating will as the

was founded, which insensibly became a liberal school

of poetry, philosophy, and rhetoric *. The annals of

the monarchy were composed; and while recent and

authentic history might afford some useful lessons

both to the prince and people, the darkness of the

first ages was embellished by the giants, the dragons,

and the fabulous heroes of Oriental romance. Every

learned or confident stranger was enriched by the

bounty, and flattered by the conversation, of the

monarch: he nobly rewarded a Greek physician, by

the deliverance of three thousand captives; and the

sophists who contended for his favour were ex­

their more successful rival. Nushirvan believed, or

at least respected, the religion of the Magi; and

some traces of persecution may be discovered in his

reign. Yet he allowed himself freely to compare the

tenets of the various sects; and the theological dis­

putes in which he frequently presided diminished

of the people. At his command, the most celebrated

writers of Greece and India were translated into the

Persian language; a smooth and elegant idiom, re­

commended by Mahomet to the use of paradise:
