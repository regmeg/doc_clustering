OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 215

pursued, aud such works may be performed, with a'

common share of judgment, experience, and industry.

The genius of Cicero and Virgil was more sensibly

felt, as each revolving age had been found incapable

of producing a similar or a second: but the most

eminent teachers of the law were assured of leaving

disciples equal or superior to themselves in merit and

reputation.

The jurisprudence which had been grossly adapted T^" pW-

to the wants of the first Komans was polished and

improved in the seventh century of the city, by the

alliance of Grecian philosophy. The Scaevolas had

been taught by use and experience; but Servius Sul-

rule, the logic of Aristotle and the stoics, reduced

particular cases to general principles, and diffused

over the shapeless mass the light of order and elo­

clined the reputation of a professed lawyer; but the

jurisprudence of his country was adorned by his in­

comparable genius, which converts into gold every

object that it touches. After the example of Plato,

he composed a republic; and, for the use of his re­

public, a treatise of laws; in which he labours to

deduce, from a celestial origin, the wisdom and jus­

tice of the Roman constitution. The whole universe,

according to his sublime hypothesis, forms one im­

mense commonwealth: gods and men, who partici­

pate of the same essence, are members of the same

community: reason prescribes the law of nature and

nations; and all positive institutions, however mo­

of right, which the Deity has inscribed on every

virtuous mind. From these philosophical mysteries,'
