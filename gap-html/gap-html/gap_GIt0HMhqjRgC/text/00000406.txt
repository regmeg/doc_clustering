"86 THE DECLINE AND FALL

chap. Amrou was inclined to gratify the wish of the gram-

'XLl 'marian; but his rigid integrity refused to alienate

the minutest object without the consent of the Caliph,

and the well known answer of Omar was inspired by

the ignorance of a fanatic: "If these writings of

"the Greeks agree with the book of God, they are

"useless, and need not be preserved; if they disagree,

"they are pernicious, and ought to be destroyed."

The sentence was executed with blind obedience:

the volumes of paper, or parchment, were distributed

among the four thousand baths of the city; and such

was their incredible multitude, that six months were

barely sufficient for the consumption of this precious

fuel. Since the dynasties of Abulpharagius have

been given to the world in a Latin version, the tale

has been repeatedly transcribed; and every scholar,

with pious indignation, has deplored the irreparable

shipwreck of the learning, the arts, and the genius of

antiquity. For my own part I am strongly tempted

to deny both the fact and the consequences. The

fact is indeed marvellous: "Read and wonder !" says

the historian himself; and the solitary report of a

stranger, who wrote, at the end of 600 years, on the

confines of Media, is overbalanced by the silence of two

annalists of a more early date, both Christians, both

natives of Egypt; and the most ancient of whom, the

patriarch Eutychius, has amply described the conquest

of Alexandria. The rigid sentence of Omar is re­

pugnant to the sound find orthodox precept of the

Mahometan casuists: they expressly declare, that the

religious books of the Jews and Christians, which are

acquired by the right of war, should never be com­

mitted to the flames; and that the works of profane

science, historians or poets, physicians or philosophers,

may be lawfully applied to the use of the faithful.

A more destructive zeal may perhaps be attributed

to the first successors of Mahomet; yet in this in.
