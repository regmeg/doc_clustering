OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. Gl

From the moment that Belisarius had determined chap.

to sustain a siege, his assiduous care provided Rome XXXIv-

against the danger of famine, more dreadful than the Distress of

Gothic arms. An extraordinary supply of corn was ' e aty-

imported from Sicily: the harvests of Campania and

Tuscany were forcibly swept for the use of the city:

and the rights of private property were infringed by

the strong plea of the public safety. It might easily

given in provisions, and the other in money. His

foresight was justified by the increase of the public
