fruitful plains to which his victory communicated

the perpetual appellation of Lombardy. A faithful

chieftain, and a select band, were stationed at Forum

Julii, the modern Friuli, to guard' the passes of the

mountains. The Lombards respected the strength

of Pavia, and listened to the prayers of the Trevisans:

their slow and heavy multitudes proceeded to occupy

lasting patrimony of the Lombards. The submission

of the people invited the Barbarian to assume the

character of a lawful sovereign, and the helpless ex­

arch was confined to the office of announcing to the
