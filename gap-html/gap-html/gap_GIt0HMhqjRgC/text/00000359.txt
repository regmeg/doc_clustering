or THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 339

camp that his authority was disobeyed and insulted: chap.

he appeased and inflamed with gold the licentious- . '.

ness of the troops; but their vices were inherent,

their victories were accidental, and their costly main­

tenance exhausted the substance of a state which

they were unable to defend. After a long and per­

nicious indulgence, the cure of this inveterate evil

was undertaken by Maurice; but the rash attempt,

which drew destruction on his own head, tended

only to aggravate the disease. A reformer should

be exempt from the suspicion of interest, and he

must possess the confidence and esteem of those

whom he proposes to reclaim. The troops of Mau­

rice might listen to the voice of a victorious leader;

they disdained the admonitions of statesmen and

sophists, and when they received an edict which de- their de­

ducted from their pay the price of their arms and content'

clothing, they execrated the avarice of a prince in­

sensible of the dangers and fatigues from which he

had escaped. The camps both of Asia and Europe

were agitated with frequent and furious seditions;

the enraged soldiers of Edessa pursued, with re­

proaches, with threats, with wounds, their trembling

generals: they overturned the statues of the em­

peror, and either rejected the yoke of all civil and

military laws, or instituted a dangerous model of

voluntary subordination. The monarch, always di­

stant and often deceived, was incapable of yielding or

persisting according to the exigence of the moment.

But the fear of a general revolt induced him too

readily to accept any act of valour, or any expression

of loyalty, as an atonement for the popular offence;

the new reform was abolished as hastily as it had

been announced, and the troops, instead of punish­

ment and restraint, were agreeably surprised by a

gracious proclamation of. immunities and rewards.
