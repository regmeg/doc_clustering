OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

tion into his eyes, as if they meant to execute a mortal XL-

sentence. An ambiguous passage of Theophanes per­

suaded the annalist of the church that death was the

immediate consequence of this barbarous execution.

The catholics have been deceived or subdued by the

authority of Baronius; and protestant zeal has re­

echoed the words of a cardinal, desirous, as it should

seem, to favour the patroness of images.

Yet the blind son of Irene survived many years,

oppressed by the court and forgotten by the world:

the Isaurian dynasty was silently extinguished; and

the memory of Constantine was recalled only by the

nuptials of his daughter Euphrosyne with the em-'

peror Michael the Second; the crime of Irene was

left five years unpunished; her reign was crowned

with external splendour; and if she could silence the

voice of conscience, she neither heard nor regarded

the reproaches of mankind.

While the popes established in Italy their freedom

and dominion, the images, the first cause of their re­

volt, were restored in the Eastern empire. Irene, as

soon as she reigned in her own name and that of her

son, undertook the ruin of the Iconoclasts. Nice

was chosen for a second synod; and the council pro­

nounced, that the worship of images is agreeable to

scripture and to reason. Of this second Nicene council

the acts are still extant, a curious monument of super­

stition and ignorance, of falsehood and folly. Yet

these acts are now revered by the catholics; and the

second council of Nice is regarded as the seventh of

the general councils.

In the East its decrees were approved, and rigor- Coronation

ously executed, by the despotism of Irene. But not- magn"e-

withstanding the acceptance of the acts of the coun- ^ £;®"°-

cil of Nice, the popes, during the reign of Irene, con- of it«iy

summated the separation of Italy from the Greek Greeks.
