chap. tinuance of the same benefit ennobled them with the

XLL title of Eleulhero, or Free-Laconians. In the time

Freemen of of Constantine Porphyrogenitus, they had acquired

the name of Mctinotes, under which they dishonour

the claim of liberty by the inhuman pillage of all

that is shipwrecked on their rocky shores. Their

territory, barren of corn, but fruitful of olives, ex­

tended to the Cape of Malea: they accepted a chief

or prince from the Byzantine praetor, and a light

tribute of four hundred pieces of gold was the badge

of their immunity rather than of their dependence.

The freemen of Laconia assumed the character of

Romans, and long adhered to* the religion of the

Greeks. By the zeal of the emperor Basil, they were

baptized in the faith of Christ: but the altars of

Venus and Neptune had been crowned by these

rustic votaries five hundred years after they were

cities and proscribed in the Roman world. In the theme of

Pdoponne- Peloponnesus, forty cities were still numbered, and

the declining state of Sparta, Argos, and Corinth,

may be suspended in the tenth century, at an equal

distance, perhaps, between their antique splendour

and their present desolation. The duty of military

service, either in person or by substitute, was imposed

on the lands or benefices of the province: a sum of

five pieces of gold was assessed on each of the sub­

stantial tenants; and the same capitation was shared

among several heads of inferior value. On the pro­

clamation of an Italian war, the Peloponnesians ex­

cused themselves by a voluntary oblation of one hun­

dred pounds of gold (four thousand pounds sterling),

and a thousand horses with their arms and trappings.

The churches and monasteries furnished their con­

tingent; a sacrilegious profit was extorted from the

sale of ecclesiastical honours; and the indigent bi­

shop of Leucadia was made responsible for a pension

of one hundred pieces of gold.
