110 THE DECLINE AND FALL

chap. the Magi. The code of laws of the first Artaxerxes

xxxv- was revived and published as the rule of the magi­

strates; but the assurance of speedy punishment was

the best security of their virtue. Their behaviour

was inspected by a thousand eyes, their words were

overheard by a thousand ears, the secret or public

agents of the throne; and the provinces, from the

Indian to the Arabian confines, were enlightened by

the frequent visits of a sovereign, who affected to

emulate his celestial brother in his rapid and salutary

career. Education and agriculture he viewed as the

two objects most deserving of his care. In every

city of Persia, orphans and the children of the poor

were maintained and instructed at the public ex­

pense; the daughters were given in marriage to the

richest citizens of their own rank, and the sons, ac­

cording to their different talents, were employed in

mechanic trades, or promoted to more honourable

service. The deserted villages were relieved by his

bounty; to the peasants and farmers who were found

incapable of cultivating their lands, he distributed

cattle, seed, and the instruments of husbandry; and

the rare and inestimable treasure of fresh water was

parsimoniously managed, and skilfully dispersed over

the arid territory of Persia. The prosperity of that

kingdom was the effect and the evidence of his vir­

tues: his vices are those of Oriental despotism; but

in the long competition between Chosroes and Jus­

tinian, the advantage both of merit and fortune is

almost always on the side of the Barbarian.

Hisioveof To the praise of justice Nushirvan united the re­

putation of knowledge; and the seven Greek phi­

losophers, who visited his court, were invited and

deceived by the strange assurance, that a disciple of

Plato was seated on the Persian throne. Did they

expect that a prince, strenuously exercised in the

toils of war and government, should agitate, with

learning.
