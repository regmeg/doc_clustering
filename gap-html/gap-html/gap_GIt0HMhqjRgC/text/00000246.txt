226 THE DECLINE AND FALL

chap. the writings, which Justinian is accused of neglect-

xxxvIL ing, many were no longer to be found in the libraries

of the East. The copies of Papinian or Ulpian,

which the reformer had proscribed, were deemed

unworthy of future notice; the twelve tables and

praetorian edict insensibly vanished, and the monu­

ments of ancient Rome were neglected or destroyed

by the envy and ignorance of the Greeks. Even the

Pandects themselves have escaped with difficulty and

danger from the common shipwreck, and criticism

has pronounced, that all the editions and manuscripts

of the West are derived from one original*. It was

transcribed at Constantinople in the beginning of the

seventh century t, was successively transported by the

accidents of war and commerce to Amalphi t, Pisa§,

and Florence ||, and is now deposited as a sacred relic ^[

in the ancient palace of the republic**.

* All, in several instances, repeat the errors of the scribe and the transposi­  
tions of some leaves in the Florentine Pandects. This fact, if it be true, is
de.

cisive. Yet the Pandects are quoted by Ivo of Chartres (who died in 1117), by

Theobald, archbishop of Canterbury, and by Vacarius, our first professor, in
the

year 1140 (Selden ad Fletam, c. 7. tom, ii p. 1080—1085). Have our British

MSS. of the Pandects been collated?

•y See the description of this original in Brenckman (Hist. Pandect. Florent.

1. i. c. 2, 3. p. 4—17. and 1. ii.). Politian, an enthusiast, revered it as
the au­

thentic standard of Justinian himself (p. 407, 408); but this paradox is
refuted

by the abbreviations of the Florentine MS. (1- ii. c . 3. p. 117—130). It is
com­

posed of two quarto volumes with large margins, on a thin parchment, and the

Latin characters betray the hand of a Greek scribe.

$ Brenckman, at the end of his history, has inserted two dissertations on the

republic of Amalphi, and the Pisan war in the year 1135, &c.

§ The discovery of the Pandects at Amalphi (A. D. 1137) is first noticed (in

1501) by Ludovicus Bologninus (Brenckman, 1. i. c. 11. p. 73, 74. 1 . iv. c.
2.

p. 417—425), on the faith of a Pisan chronicle (p. 409, 410), without a name

or a date. The whole story, though unknown to the xiith century, embellished

by ignorant ages, and suspected by rigid criticism, is not, however, destitute
of

much internal probability (1. i. c. 4 8. p. 17—50). The Liber Pandectarum

of Pisa was undoubtedly consulted in the xivth century by the great Bartolus

(p. 406, 407. See 1 . i. c 9. p. 50—62).

U Pisa was taken by the Florentines in the year 1406; and in 1411 the

Pandects were transported to the capital. These events are authentic and
famous.

51 They were new bound in purple, deposited in a rich casket, and shown to

curious travellers by the monks and magistrates bareheaded, and with lighted

tapers (Brenckman, 1. i. c. 10, 11, 12. p. 62—93).

** After the collations of Politian, Bologninus, and Antoninus Augustinus, and  
the splendid edition of the Pandects by Taurellus (in 1551), Henry Brenckman,

a Dutchman, undertook a pilgrimage to Florence, where he employed several

years in the study of a single manuscript. His Historia Pandectarum Florcn-

tinorum (Utrecht, 1722, in 4to), though a monument of industry, is a small
por­

tion of his original design.
