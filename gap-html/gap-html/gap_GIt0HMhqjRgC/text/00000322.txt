302 THE DECLINE AND FALL

chap. soldier of his king and his duke; and the civil as-

xxxviii. semblies of the nation displayed the banners, and

assumed the appellation, of a regular army. Of this

army, the pay and the rewards were drawn from the

conquered provinces; and the distribution, which

■ was not effected till after the death of Alboin, is

disgraced by the foul marks of injustice and rapine.

Many of the most wealthy Italians were slain or

banished; the remainder were divided among the

strangers; and a tributary obligation was imposed

(under the name of hospitality), of paying to the

Lombards a third part of the fruits of the earth.

Within less than seventy years, this artificial system

was abolished by a more simple and solid tenure.

Either the Roman landlord was expelled by his strong

and insolent guest; or the annual payment, a third

of the produce, was exchanged, by a more equitable

transaction, for an adequate proportion of landed

property. Under these foreign masters, the business

of agriculture, in the cultivation of corn, vines, and

olives, was exercised with degenerate skill and in­

dustry by the labour of the slaves and natives. But

the occupations of a pastoral life were more pleasing

to the idleness of the Barbarians. In the rich mea­

dows of Venetia, they restored and improved the

breed of horses for which that province had once been

illustrious; and the Italians beheld with astonishment

a foreign race of oxen or buffaloes. The depopulation

of Lombardy, and the increase of forests, afforded an

ample range for the pleasures of the chase*. That

marvellous art which teaches the birds of the air to

acknowledge the voice and execute the commands

of their master had been unknown to the ingenuity

of the Greeks and Romans. Scandinavia and Scythia

produce the boldest and most tractable falcons; they

were tamed and educated by the roving inhabitants,
