OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE; 29

"become the slave of an unjust enemy, who has de- chap.

"served my implacable hatred. Him I had never 1

"injured, either by word or deed: yet he has sent

"against me, I know not from whence, a certain

"Belisarius, who has cast me headlong from the

"throne into this abyss of misery. Justinian is a

"man; he is a prince; does he not dread for him-

"self a similar reverse of fortune? I can write no

"more: my grief oppresses me. Send me, I be- .

seech you, my dear Pharas, send me a lyre, a

"spunge, and a loaf of bread." From the Vandal

messenger, Pharas was informed of the motives of

this singular request. It was long since the king of

Africa had tasted bread; a defluxion had fallen on

his eyes, the effect of fatigue or incessant weeping;

and he wished to solace the melancholy hours, by

singing to the lyre the sad story of his own mis­

fortunes. The humanity of Pharas was moved; he

sent the three extraordinary gifts; but even his hu­

manity prompted him to redouble the vigilance of

his guard, that he might sooner compel his prisoner

to embrace a resolution advantageous to the Romans,

but salutary to himself. The obstinacy of Gelimer

at length yielded to reason and necessity; the solemn

assurances of safety and honourable treatment were

ratified in the emperor's name, by the ambassador of

Belisarius; and the king of the Vandals descended

from the mountain. The first public interview was

in one of the suburbs of Carthage; and when the

royal captive accosted his conqueror, he burst into a

fit of laughter. The crowd might naturally believe,

that extreme grief had deprived Gelimer of his

senses; but in this mournful state, unseasonable

mirth insinuated to more intelligent observers, that

the vain and transitory scenes of human greatness

are unworthy of a serious thought.
