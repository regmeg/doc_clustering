298 THE DECLINE AND FALL

chap. Imperial forces had been effected in the neighbour-

xxxvm. hood of Milan, perhaps they might have subverted

the throne of the Lombards; but the Franks ex­

pected six days the signal of a flaming village, and

the arms of the Greeks were idly employed in the

reduction of Modena and Parma, which were torn

from them after the retreat of their Transalpine

allies. The victorious Autharis asserted his claim to

the dominion of Italy. At the foot of the Rhaetian

or valleys of Ferrara and Commachio, five maritime

cities from Rimini to Ancona, and a second, inland

Pentapolis, between the Adriatic coast and the hills

of the Apennine. Three subordinate provinces, of

Rome, of Venice, and of Naples, which were divided

by hostile lands from the palace bf Ravenna, acknow­

ledged, both in peace and war, the supremacy of the

exarch. The duchy of Rome appears to have in­

cluded the Tuscan, Sabine, and Latian conquests, of

the first four hundred years of the city; and the limits

may be distinctly traced along the coast, from Civita
