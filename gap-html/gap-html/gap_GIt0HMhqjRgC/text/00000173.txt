OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 153

"The soldiers already stationed in the province are. _

"discontented, fearful, and dismayed; at the sound

"of an enemy, they dismiss their horses, and cast

"their arms on the ground. No taxes can be raised,

"since Italy is in the hands of the Barbarians; the

"failure of payment has deprived us of the right of

"command, or even of admonition. Be assured,

"dread sir, that the greater part of your troops have

"already deserted to the Goths. If the war could

"be achieved by the presence of Belisarius alone,

"your wishes are satisfied; Belisarius is in the midst

"of Italy. But if you desire to conquer, far other

"preparations are requisite: without a military force,

"the title of general is an empty name. It would be

"expedient to restore to my service my own veterans

"and domestic guards. Before I can take the field,

"I must receive an adequate supply of light and

"heavy armed troops; and it is only with ready

"money that you can procure the indispensable aid

"of a powerful body of the cavalry of the Huns*."

An officer in whom Belisarius confided was sent from

Ravenna to hasten and conduct the succours; but

the message was neglected, and the messenger was

detained at Constantinople by an advantageous mar­

riage. After his patience had been exhausted by

delay and disappointment, the Roman general re­

passed the Hadriatic, and expected at Dyrrachium

the arrival of the troops, which were slowly assembled

among the subjects and allies of the empire. His

powers were still inadequate to the deliverance of

Rome, which was closely besieged by the Gothic

king. The Appian way, a march of forty days, was

covered by the Barbarians; and as the prudence of

* Procopiu8, 1. iii. c . 12. The soul of a hero is deeply impressed on the  
letter; nor can we confound such genuine and original acts with the elaborate

and often empty speeches of the Byzantine historians.
