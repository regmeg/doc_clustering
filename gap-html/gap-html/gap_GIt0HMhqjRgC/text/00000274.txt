254 THE DECLINE AND FALL

chap. the civilians with the epithet of real*. A grateful

xxxvn- return is due to the author of a benefit; and who­

ever is intrusted with the property of another has

bound himself to the sacred duty of restitution. In

the case of a friendly loan, the merit of generosity is

on the side of the lender only; in a deposit, on the

side of the receiver: but in a pledge, and the rest of

the selfish commerce of ordinary life, the benefit is

compensated by an equivalent, and the obligation to

restore is variously modified by the nature of the

transaction. The Latin language very happily ex­

presses the fundamental difference between the com-

modatum and the mutuum, which our poverty is re­

duced to confound under the vague and common

appellation of a loan. In the former, the borrower

was obliged to restore the same individual thing with

which he had been accommodated for the temporary

supply of his wants; in the latter, it was destined

for his use and consumption, and he discharged this

mutual engagement, by substituting the same specific

value, according to a just estimation of number, of

weight, and of measure. In the contract of sale,

the absolute dominion is transferred to the purchaser,

and he repays the benefit with an adequate sum of

gold or silver, the price or universal standard of all

earthly possessions. The obligation of another con­

tract, that of location, is of a more complicated kind.

Lands or houses, labour or talents, may be hired for

a definite term; at the expiration of the time, the

thing itself must be restored to the owner with an

additional reward for the beneficial occupation and

employment. In these lucrative contracts, to which

may be added those of partnership and commissions,

* The nice and various subject of contracts by consent is spread over four  
books (xvii.—xx.) of the Pandects, and is one of the parts best deserving of
the

attention of an English student.
