OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 465

new enemies and new misfortunes: the relics of Italy ct*fi*-

were swept away by the Norman adventurers; and —

almost all the Asiatic branches were dissevered from

the Roman trunk by the Turkish conquerors. After

these losses, the emperors of the Comnenian family

continued to reign from the Danube to Peloponnesus,

and from Belgrade to Nice, Trebizond, and the wind­

ing stream of the Meander. The spacious provinces

of Thrace, Macedonia, and Greece, were obedient to

their sceptre: the possession of Cyprus, Rhodes, and

Crete, was accompanied by the fifty islands of the

transcends the measure of the largest of the European

kingdoms.

The same princes might assert with dignity and General

truth, that of all the monarchs of Christendom they populous-

possessed the greatest city, the most ample revenue,

the most flourishing and populous state. With the

decline and fall of the empire, the cities of the West

had decayed and fallen; nor could the ruins of

Rome, or the mud walls, wooden hovels, and narrow

precincts, of Paris and London, prepare the Latin

stranger to contemplate the situation and extent of

Constantinople, her stately palaces and churches, and

the arts and luxury of an innumerable people. Her

riches might attract, but her virgin strength had re­

pelled, and still promised to repel, the audacious in­

vasion of the Persian and Bulgarian, the Arab and

the Russian. The provinces were less fortunate and

impregnable; and few districts, few cities, could be

discovered, which had not been violated by some fierce

Barbarian, impatient to despoil, because he was hope­

less to possess. From the age of Justinian, the Eastern

empire was sinking below its former level: the powers

of destruction were more active than those of im

provement; and the calamities of war were imbit-

tered by the more permanent evils of tyranny. Yet
