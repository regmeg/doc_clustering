• dedicated to the foundation of seven monasteries,

one in Rome, and six in Sicily; and it was the wish

of Gregory that he might be unknown in this life,

and glorious only in the next. Yet his devotion,

and it might be sincere, pursued the path which

would have been chosen by a crafty and ambitious

statesman. The talents of Gregory, and the splen­

dour which accompanied his retreat, rendered him

dear and useful to the church; and implicit obe­

dience has been always inculcated as the first duty

of a monk. As soon as he had received the cha­

racter of deacon, Gregory was sent to reside at the

Byzantine court, the nuncio or minister of the apos­

tolic see; and he boldly assumed, in the name of

St. Peter, a_ tone of independent dignity, which

would have been criminal and dangerous in the most

illustrious layman of the empire. He returned to

Rome with a just increase of reputation, and after a

short exercise of the monastic virtues, he was dragged

from the cloister to the papal throne, by the unani­

mous voice of the clergy, the senate, and the people.

He alone resisted, or seemed to resist, his own eleva­

tion; and his humble petition, that Maurice would

be pleased to reject the choice of the Romans, could

only serve to exalt his character in the eyes of the

emperor and the public. When the fatal mandate

was proclaimed, Gregory solicited the aid of some

friendly merchants to convey him in a basket beyond

the gates of Rome, and modestly concealed himselt

some days among the woods and mountains, till his

retreat was discovered.

SoSS The Pontificate of Gregory the Great, which lasted

the Great, thirteen years six months and ten days, is one of the

a.d. 590, most edifying periods of the history of the church.
