OV THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 243

failure was supplied by the nomination of the praetor chap.

of the city, or the president of the province. But

the person whom they named to this public office

might be legally excused by insanity or blindness, by

ignorance or inability, by previous enmity or adverse

interest, by the number of children or guardianships

with which he was already burthened, and by the

immunities which were granted to the useful labours

of magistrates, lawyers, physicians, and professors.

Till the infant could speak and think, he was re­

presented by the tutor, whose authority was finally

determined by the age of puberty. Without his con­

sent, no act of the pupil could bind himself to his

own prejudice, though it might oblige others for his

personal benefit. It is needless to observe, that the

tutor often gave security, and always rendered an

account, and that the want of diligence or integrity

exposed him to a civil and almost criminal action for

the violation of his sacred trust. The age of puberty

had been rashly fixed by the civilians at fourteen;

but as the faculties of the mind ripen more slowly

than those of the body, a curator was interposed to

guard the fortunes of the Roman youth from his own

inexperience and headstrong passions. Such a trustee

had been first instituted by the praetor, to save a

family from the blind havoc of a prodigal or madman:

and the minor was compelled by the laws to solicit

the same protection, to give validity to his acts till

he accomplished the full period of twenty-five years.

Women were condemned to the perpetual tutelage of

parents, husbands, or guardians; a sex created to

please and obey was never supposed to have attained

the age of reason and experience. Such at least was

the stern and haughty spirit of the ancient law, which

had been insensibly mollified before the time of Jus­

tinian. ■:
