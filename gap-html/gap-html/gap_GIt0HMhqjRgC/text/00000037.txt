"OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 17

third part of his numbers: but each Scythian was chap.

fired by the example of his chief, who gloriously exer­

cised the privilege of his family, by riding foremost

and alone to shoot the first arrow against the enemy.

In the meanwhile, Gelimer himself, ignorant of the

event, and misguided by the windings of the hills,

inadvertently passed the Roman army, and reached

the scene of action where Ammatas had fallen. He

wept the fate of his brother and of Carthage, charged

with irresistible fury the advancing squadrons, and

might have pursued, and perhaps decided the victory,

if he had not wasted those inestimable moments in

the discharge of a vain, though pious, duty to the

dead. While his spirit was broken by this mourn­

ful office, he heard the trumpet of Belisarius, who,

leaving Antonina and his infantry in the camp,

pressed forwards with his guards and the remainder

of the cavalry to rally his flying troops, and to restore

the fortune of the day. Much room could not be

found in this disorderly battle for the talents of a

general; but the king fled before the hero; and the

Vandals, accustomed only to a Moorish enemy, were

incapable of withstanding the arms and discipline of

the Romans. Gelimer retired with hasty steps to­

wards the desert of Numidia; but he had soon the

consolation of learning that his private orders for the

execution of Hilderic and his captive friends had

been faithfully obeyed. The tyrant's revenge was

useful only to his enemies. The death of a lawful

prince excited the compassion of his people; his life

might have perplexed the victorious Romans; and

the beutenant of Justinian, by a crime of which he

was innocent, was relieved from the painful alter*

native of forfeiting his honour or relinquishing his

conquests.

As soon as the tumult had subsided, the several Reduction

parts of the army informed each other of the ac-A.D. 533.'
