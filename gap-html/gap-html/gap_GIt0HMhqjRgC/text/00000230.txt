210 THE DECLINE AND FALL

chap. of a great empire can seldom be influenced by any

x l' personal considerations. Virtue, or even reason, will

suggest to bis impartial mind, that he is the guardian

of peace and equity, and that the interest of society

is inseparably connected with his own. Under the

weakest and most vicious reign, the seat of justice was

filled by the wisdom and integrity of Papinian and

Ulpian; and the purest materials of the Code and

Constantine. The third, which is still extant, was

digested in sixteen books by the order of the younger

Theodosius, to consecrate the laws of the Christian

princes from Constantine to his own reign. But the
