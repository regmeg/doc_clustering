180 THE DECLINE AND FALL

'back, and in -complete armour, skirmished without

peril round this immoveable phalanx; supplied by

active speed the deficiency of number; and aimed

a. d. 554 Gothic kings was filled by the exarchs of Ravenna,

the representatives in peace and war of the emperor

of the Romans. Their jurisdiction was soon reduced

to the limits of a narrow province: but Narses him­
