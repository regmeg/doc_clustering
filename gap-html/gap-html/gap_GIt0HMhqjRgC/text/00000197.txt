OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 177

Buccelin, the dukes of the Alemanni, stood forth as XXXVL

the leaders of the Italian war; and seventy-five thou足

sand Germans descended in the autumn from the

Rhaetian alps into the plain of Milan. The vanguard

of the Roman army was stationed near the Po, under

the conduct of Fulcaris, a bold Herulian, who rashly

Calabria. They followed the coast of the Mediter足

ranean and the Hadriatic, as far as Rhegium and

Otranto, and the extreme lands of Italy were the

term of their destructive progress. The Franks, who

were Christians and Catholics, contented themselves
