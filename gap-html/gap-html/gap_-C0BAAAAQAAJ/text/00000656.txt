called by the Bulgarians Pel, and by the Greeks

rif'AATj. Below tlie fountain, are some remains of

buildings, said to have been baths, and still called

ra Aompd. These baths are alluded t«> by the

comic poet Machon {op. A then. viii. p. 348, e.) as

producing biliary complaints. Although little re­

mains of Pella, A clear idea may be tunned of its

extent and general plan by means of the description

in Livy, compared with the existing traces, con-

sating mainly of'MumnhV' The circumference of

the ancient city has been estimated at about 3

miles. The sources of the fountains, of which there

are two, were probably about the centre of the site;

and the modern road may possibly be in the exact

line (if a main street which traverses it from K. to W.

The temple of Minerva AleidemUfl is the only public

building mentioned in history (Liv.xlii.51), but of its

situation nothing at present is known. Felix Beau-

jour, who was consul-general at Saloniki {Tableau

tin Commerce de la Ot\rt\ vol. i. p. 87). asserted

that he saw the remains of a port, and of a canal

communicating with the sea. Leake (Northern

Greece, vol. iii. pp. 261—266), who carefully went

over the ground, could find no traces of a port, of

which indeed there is no mention in ancient history:

remains of a canal could be seen, as lie was told, in

summer.

latter district. (Plin. v. 18. s. 16; Joseph. B.J. iii.

Coelc-Syria and Ptolemy (v. 15. § 23) also de­

scribes it as a city of Decapolis in Code-Syria.

Stephen us adds that it was also called But is {y

Bairn), which appellation seems to be preserved in

its modern name El-Bwhche. Its name Pclla shows

that it was either built or coloni.-ed by the Mace­

donians. Pliny describes it as abounding in springs

("aquis divitein," Plin. I. c). It was taken by An-

tiochus the Great (Polyb. v. 70), and was afterwards

destroyed by Alexander Jannaeus, because its inha­

bitants would not accept the Jewish religion (Joseph.

Ant. xiii. 15 (23). § 3, /;../. i. 4. § 8); but it was

afterwards restored by Pompey. (Joseph. Ant* xiv.
