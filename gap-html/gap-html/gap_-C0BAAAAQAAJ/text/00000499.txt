NEA'POLIS. II. In Asia. 1. An important

city of Palaestine, commonly supposed to be identical

with the Sichem or Shechem of the Old Testament.

Thus Epiphanius uses the names as synonymous

{iv ^ixlfwis, tout' lariv iv ttj vvv\ NfawdAfi, adv.

Uaeres.lib. iii. torn. i.p. 1055,comp.l068). Eusebius

and St. Jerome, however, place Sichem (Sochxa,

2uKru, 2ux*") in the suburbs of Neapolis ( Onommt.

s. vv. Terebinthus, Sychein); and Luz is placed near

to, and, according to the former, viii. M. P., according

to the latter, iii. M. P., from Neapolis (». v. Aoufa),

which would imply a considerable interval between

the ancient and the modern city. In order to re­

concile this discrepancy, Reland suggests that while

the ancient city gradually decayed, the new city was

extended by gradual accretion in the opposite direc­

tion, so as to widen the interval ; and he cites in

illustration the parallel case of Utrecht and Yeehten.

{Palaestina, pp. 1004, 1005,) Another ancient

name of this city occurs only in one passage of

St. John's Gospel (iv. 5), where it is called Sichar

(2ix°V); for although St. Jerome maintains this to

be a corrupt rending for Sychem (Epitaph. Pauhie,

Ep. lxxxvL Op. torn. iv. p. 676, Quaest. in Genes.

c xlviii. ver. 22, torn ii. p. 545), his correction of

what he allows was an ancient and common error,

even in his age, has no authority in any known codex

or version. Another of its ancient names which has

exercised the ingenuity of the learned, occurs in

Pliny, who reckons among the cities of Samaria,

'* Neapolis quod antea Mamortha dicebatur" (v. 13),

evidently a mistake for Mabortha, which Josephus

gives for the native name of Neapolis {B. J. iv. 8.

§ 2); unless, as Keland conjectures, both readings

are to be corrected from coins, which he shrewdly re­

marks are less liable to corruption than MSS., and

which read Morthia (Mopflfo), which that learned

writer takes to be the classical form of the Hebrew

word Moreh, which was associated with Sichem, both

in the Old Testament and the Rabbinical commen­

taries. {Gen. xii. 6; Bent. xi. 30; Keland, Disser-

tatiunes Miscell. pars L pp. 138 — 140.) The same

writer explains the name Sichar, in St. John, as a

name of reproach, contemptuously assigned to the

city by the Jews as the seat of error (the Hebrew

*lfcS? signifying mendacium, fakum), and borrowed  
from the prophet Habakkuk, where the two words

Moreh Shaker Qgtf' HDD) occur in convenient
