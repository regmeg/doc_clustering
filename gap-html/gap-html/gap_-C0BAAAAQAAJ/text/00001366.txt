VESTIXI.

rook which Caesar describes as occupying the neck

of land, where the river does not flow. The lower

town is on the other side of the river opposite to the

peninsula, with which it is connected by a stone

bridge, the foundations of which are Roman.

There is a Roman triumphal arch witha single pas­

sage. The date of its construction does not appear.

This arch which was nearly hidden by rubbish and

buildings has been partially uncovered and restored

within the present century. It is decorated with

sculptures. There are some remains of the aque-

<lnet which supplied Yesontio with water from a

distant source. It was constructed of a soft stone. It

terminated in the town in a vast reservoir of an oval

form, which was covered by a roof supported by

columns. The water was distributed from the re­

servoir all through the town: and in many parts of

Besanqon there have been found traces of the con­

duits which conveyed the water to the private

houses. (Penny Cyclopaedia, art. JBesanqon;

VESPER1ES, a town of the Varduli in Hispania

Tarraconensis. (Pliu. iii. 20. s. 34.) It is identi­

VESTINI (Ot'ijCTTiVoi), a people of Central Italy,

who occupied a mountainous tract extending from

the coast of the Adriatic to the lofty mountains near

the sources of the Aternus. Here they met the

Nubincs, whose territory bounded them on the W.;

thence they were bounded by the high moun­

tain range which forms the southern barrier of the

valley of the Aternus, and separated them from the

Aeqni and Marsi; while towards the S. and E. the

river Aternus itself, from the point where it takes

the sudden bend towards the NE., became the limit

of their territory, and their frontier towards the Pe-

ligni and Marrucini. Along the coast of the Adriatic

they held only the narrow space between the mouth

of the Aternus and that of the Matrinus, a distance of

about G miles; the latter river apparently formed

the northern limit of their territory from its mouth

to its source, and thence to the high ridge of the

Central Ai>onuines their exact frontier cannot be

traced. But it is almost immediately after passing

the point where the Vestiui adjoined the Praetutn

on the one hand and the Sabines on the other, that

the chain of the Apennines rises abruptly into the

lofty group or m:iss, of which the Monte Corno

(commonly called the Gran Sasso d Italia) Is the

highest summit. This mountain is the most ele­

vated in tlie whole range of the Apennines, attaining

to a height of 9500 feet; and those immediately ad­

joining it are but little inferior, forming a rugged and

irregular mass of mountains, which is continued

without interruption by a range of inferior but still

very considerable elevation, in a SE. direction. This

range is almost continuous with the equally lofty

ridge of the Monte Aforrone, the two being separated

only by the deep and narrow gorge below Popolt,

through which the Aternus finds its way to the sea.

Hence the territory of the Vestini is naturally divided

into two distinct regions, the one consisting of the

upper valley of the Aternus, W. of the lofty mountain

range above described, the other of the tract on the E.

of the same mountains, sloping gradually thence

to the sea. This last district U very hilly and

ragged, but has the advantage ofa far milder climate

than that of the basin of the Aternus, which is a ,

bleak and cold upland region, having much analogy |

with the valley of the Peligui (of vtinVtw »

from its considerable elevation above Ik m
