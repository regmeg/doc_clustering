800 MAZICES. MEDIA.

It docs not seem to have ever risen in ancient

times t<i the rank of a city. Pliny mentions the

rirer Mazara, as does l'lolemy also, but neither of

them notice the town. (I'lin. iii. 8. s. 14; Ptol.

iii. 4. § 5.) The existence of this last is, however,

attested by the Itinerary, which correctly places it

12 miles from Lilybaenm (/(to. Ant. p. 89); but it

was first raised to an important position by the

Saracens in the 9th century, under whom it became

the capital of the whole surrounding district, as it

continued under the Norman rule. The western

province of Sicily still bears the name of Val di

Miazara, but the town itself has greatly declined,

thuuiih it still retains the rank of a city, and has

about 10,000 inhabitants, (l'azell. de Jitb. Sic. vi.

5. p. 2S4; Smyth's Sicily, p. 224.) A few sarco­

phagi and inscriptions are the only remains of anti­

quity extant there.

The river Mazara, or Mazarus, as it is called

by Diodorus (Md£apoy, l>iod. xiii. 54), is still

called the Flume di Mazzara. [E. H. B.]

MAZICES (MoXikm, Ptol. iv. 2. § 19; Mazax,

Luran. iv. C81; Claudian, Stil i. 356), a people of

Maurctania Caesaricnsis, who joined in the revolt of

Kinnus, but submitted to Thcodosius, A. I). 373.

(Anttn. Marc. xxix. 5. § 17; Le Beau.ita* Empire,

vol. iii. p. 471; comp. Uibbon, c. xxv.) [E. B. J.]

ME'AKUS (Miapot, Ptol. ii. 6. § 4; Mela, iii. 1.

§ 9), a small river on the N. coast of Hispania Tar-

raconensis, flowing into the gulf of the Artabri, still

called the Mcro.

MKCIKIS, a town of Marmarica, which the Peu.

tinker Table places at 33 M. P. to the K. of Pa-

liurus ; the Antoninc Itinerary has a town Miciiera

(one MS. reads Mecira), 20 M. P. to the E. of the

same plate ; its position must be sought in the

n'atiy-er-Ritma (Uarth, Wandermyen, pp. 509,

549.) [E. B. J]

MECYBERNA (MnmJSepFO: Eth. Mn*u««p-

raios, Steph. B.; Scyl. p. 26; Scymn. 640), a

town which stood at the head of the Toronaic gulf,

which was also railed Sisus Mkcyiikknaeis.

(I'lin. iv. 10; Pomp. Mela, ii. 3. § 1.) Mecybcma

was the port of Olynthus (Strab. vii. p. 330), and

lay between that town and Scnnyle. (Herod, vii. 122.)

It was taken from the Athenians by the Chalcidic

Thracians (Time. v. 39), and surrendered to Philip

before tho siege of Olynthus. (I)iod. xvi. 54.)

The site must be sought at Molicopyryo, where

iome remains of antiquity are said to be preserved.

(Le.ikc, North. Greece, vol. iii. p. 155.) [E. B. J.]

MEDAVA (M-foot/a), a town of Arabia Petraea,

placed by Ptolemy in long. 68° 30', lat. 30° 45',

doubtless identical with Medeba or Madcba [Ma­

dera], the letters av and aS being identical in sound,

and, consequently, used interchangeably, especially in

proper names. "(Ptol. v. 17. § 6.) [G.W.j

MEDAURA (Ad Medera, Itm. Anton. ; i'eut.

Tab.; Hygin. de Lim. p. 163; 'Afxpaioapa at.

'Afjui&tpa, Ptol. iv. 3. § 30: Eth. Medaurcnsis), a

town of Numidia, which had originally belonged

to the kingdom of Syphax, bat was annexed to

that of Maseinissa at the close of the Second Pu­

bic War, and afterwards was colonisod by a detach­

ment of Roman veterans, when it attained consi­

derable splendour. Appuleius was born at this place,

where his father had been " duumvir.*1 and calls him­

self*' Seminumida" and " Seuiigaetnlus." (Apolog.

pp. 443. 444.) It lay on the road from Lares to

'Iheveste, 48 M. P. from the former and 25 M. P.

from tie latter. At a river Ardatio, which flowed

between this place and Theveste, Mazcewl defeated

the Moorish chieftain Gildo. (Oros. vii. 36; St. Martin.

Jjt Beau, lias Empire, vol. v. p. 161; comp. Gibb* v-,

c. xxix.) Justinian fortified and placed a garrww

in this town, which Procopius (de Aed, vi. 6) csJk

Ai'.ii.Ttoa. It is perhaps a different place tram

Madaura, to which Augustine was sent to be edu­

cated (Confess, ii. 3). [E. B. J]

MEDEBA. [Madeba.]

MEDEN (MwSf'r, Procop. B. V. ii. 4), a town on

the spurs of Mount Papua, in the inland country .<f

Numidia. Gelimer, king of the Vandals retired to

this fastness in a. d. 534, but was romprlled to

surrender to Pharas, chief of the Heruli. (\je Bean,

Bas Empire, vol. viii. p. 248; comp. Uibbon, e.

ME'DEON (MiStii,: Eth. M«8«4«<i«). 1. Or

Mi iikin (MtSluf: Katuna), a town in the in­

terior of Acamania, on the road from Stratus and

Phytia (or Phoeteiae) to Limnaea on the Am-

braciot gulf. It was one of the few towns in tbe

interior of the country which maintained its incV-

pendence against the Aetolians after the death -if

Alexander the Great. At length, in B. c. 231. the

Actolians laid siege to Medeon with a large force,

and had reduced it to great distress, when they were

attacked by a body of Illyrian mercenaries, who had

been sent by sea by Demetrius, king of Macedonia,

in order to relieve the place. The Aetoliane were

defeated, and obliged to retreat with the loss of their

camp, arms, and baggage. Medeon is again men­

tioned in B. c. 191, as one of the Acamanian towns,

of which Antiochus, king of Syria, obtained peases

sion in that year. (Thuc. iii. 106: Polyb. ii. 2,3;

Liv. xxxvi. 11, 12; Leake, Northern Greece, toL

iii. p. 575.)

2. A town of Phocis, destroyed along with the

other Phocian towns at the termination of the Sacred

War, and never again restored. (Paus. x. 3. § 2.)

Strabo places it on the Crissaean gulf, at tbe dis­

tance of 160 stadia from Boeotia (ix. pp. 410,

423); and Pausanias says that it waa near Anti-

cyra (x. 36. § 6; comp.' Steph. B. s. r.). Leake

places it at Vhesfhta. (Northern Greece, voL iL

p. 548.)

3. An ancient town of Boeotia, mentioned by

Homer (//. ii. 501), is described by Strabo as a de­

pendency of Haliartus, and situated near Onchet4a*.

at the foot of Mt. Phoeniciuin, from which poMt:<«>

it was afterwards called Phoenicia (ix. pp. 410. 423;

comp. Slept). B. a. v.; Plin. iv. 7. a 12). It ap­

pears to have stood near the lake, in tbe bay on the

north-western side of Mount Faya, between tbe -.it*

of Haliartns and Kardliitza. (Leake, Northern*

Greece, vol. ii. p. 215.)

4. A town of the Labeates, in Dalmatia ia lHyri-

cum. (Liv. xliv. 23, 32.)

MEDEMACl'M, in Gallia Belgica, U placed by

the Antonine Itin. on a road from Coloaia Trajana

(Kelln) through Juliacnm (Jailers') to CoJortia

Agrippina (Cologne). It lies between Sablxoes and

Teudurum (TvdUkr), and ia supposed by some geo­

graphers to be Merum-liuremonde. [ii. L.]

MEDIA (v Mr-Sio: Eth. Mijooi: Adj. Mutt.

koj), a country of i onsiderable extent and imp-*rt-

ance, in the western part of Asia, between the Cas­

pian Sea on the N. and the great rivers of Me-

sopotamia on tbe W. It is by no means easy Id

determine what were its precise boundaries, or bow

much was comprehended under the name of Media.
