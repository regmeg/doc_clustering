that the town, though situated some distance from

.TOV1S MOXS (Mongri, near Ampuria*), a spur

of tlic Pyrenees in Sjiain, running out into the

Mediterranean near the frontier of Gaul. The .step-

like terraces which its face presented were called

Scalae Herculis. (Mela, ii. 6. § 5.) [P. S.]

JOVIS MONS (to A.i.1 opos, Ptol. it. 3. § 18;

Zoican), a mountain of Africa Propria, between the

rivers Itagradas and Triton, apparently containing

the sources of the river Catada. f P. S.]

JOVIS PAGL'S, a town in the interior of Moesia,

on the eastern Lank of the Margns. (/tin. Hieros.

p. 565; Tub. 7Vr«\; Gcog. ll.iv. iv. 7, where it is

called simply Pagus.) Some identify it with the

modern Glagoeacz. [L. S.]

JOVIS PKOMOXTORIUM (Alas aicpa, Ptol.

vii. 4. § 4), a promontory mentioned by Ptolemy, at

the S. end of the island of Taprobatie ( Ceylon). Its

exact position cannot be identified, but it must have

bc-n in the neighbourhood of the present Point du

Gall*, if it l« not the same. [V.]

1PAGRO or IPAGRL'M (.lyuiTar.nn the Cabra),

a city of Hispania Baetica, 28 M P. south of Corduba,

on tlie road to Gades. (I tin. Ant. p. 412; I user. ap.

IPNI ('Iaroi), on Ule coast of Magnesia, in Thes-

fleet of Xerxes was wrecked, seems to have been the

name of some rocks. (Herod, vii. 188 ; Strab. ix.

p. 443)

IPNL'S ('I»koj: Kth. 'Iwyis), a town of the

Jiocri Ozolac, of uncertain site. (Time. iii. 101;

Steph. B. i. r.)

1PSUS ("IuVoor or'I+oi), a small town of I'hry-

gia, a few miles below Synnada. The place itself

never was of any particular note, but it is celebrated

in history fir the great battle fought in its plains,

It. c. 301, by the aged Antigonus and his son De­

metrius against the combined forces of Cassandcr,

I.ysiniachuii, Ptolemy, and Seleucus, in which An­

tigonus lost his conquests and his life. (Plut Pyrrh.

4; Appian, Syriac. 55.) From Hierocles (p. 677)

and the Acts of Councils (ConciL .\icaen, ii. p. 161),

we learn that in the seventh and eighth centuries it

was the see of a Christian bishop. Some moderns

identify Ipius with Iptili Ilusar. [L. S.]

IRA ('Ifxl). 1. A town of Measenia, mentioned

by Homer (IL ix. 150,292), usually identified with

the later Abia on the Mcsaenian gulf. [Ama.]

2. Or Kiba (E/po), a mountain in Messenia,

which the Mesaeniaiu fortified in the Second Messe-

nian War, and which Aristomenes defended for ten

years against the Spartans, It was in the north of

Messenia, near the river Neda. Leake pl.ieea it at

no great distance from tlie sea, under the aide of the

mountain on which now stands Sittheruhutro and

Mdrmaro; but tliere are no ancient remains in this

spot. More to the east, on tlie left bank of the Neda,

near KakaUtri, are the remains of an ancient fortress,

which was, in all probability, Kira; and the lofty

mountain above, now called Tetrdti, was probably

the highest summit of Mount Kirn. (Pans.it. 17.

IKENOTOLIS (EijnjKJiroXij), a town of the dis­

trict Lacunitis, in tho north-east of Cilicia. It was

situated not far from tho river Calycadnus, and is

said to have once home the name of Xcronias (Ncpv-

ki'oj). (Theoiloret. llitt. Kccla. i. 7, ii. 8; Socrat. u.

1BXA (Eipia. Ptol.: Eth. Iricnsis: Voghcrn). a

considerable town of the interior of Liguria, men­

tioned both by I'liny and Ptolemy, as well as in tlie

Itineraries, which place it 10 miles from Dertona, on

the raid to Placcntia. (Plin. iii. 5. a. 7; Ptol. iii.

1. § 35; /(in. Ant. p. 288; Tab. Petit.) Thia dis-

tance agrees with tlie site of the modern town <■:

Voghera, which apiiears to hate been called in tlm

middle ages I'ictw trine, a name pradnally corrupted

into its modern appellation. It is situated on the

little river Stajfora, which would seem to hate borne

in ancient times the same name with the city: it is

called Hiria or Iria by P. Diacunus, whotelU us thai

the emperor Majoriaims was put to death on its

banks. (//«(. Miscell. xvi. p. 554.) Ptolemy in­

cludes Iria, as well as Dertona, in the territory of

the Taurini; but this would seem to be certainly a

mistake: that people could never have extended so

far to tho eastward. An inscription (of which list

reading is, however, a matter of controversy) has

'"Coloniae Foro Juli Iriensium," from which it wou. I

seem that Iria, as well as the neighbouring Dertona,

became a colony after the death of Caesar, and ob­

tained the name of Forum Julii; but thia u very

doubtful. No other trace is found either of the lian.c

or the colony. (Mafl'ei, -1/im. Ver. p. 371.4; Muni.

IKINK, an island in the Argolic gulf, supposed by

Leake to be Ypsili. (Plin. it. 12. a. 19; Leake,

Peioponnesiaca, p. 294.)

1RINUS SINUS. [Cantiii Sinus.]

IR1PP0, a town of Hispania Bactica (Plin. iii. I.

a. 3), which Ukert supposes to have been situated

in tlie Sierra dc Honda, near Zara or PinaL (Flo.

rez, Etp. S. vol. xii. p. 303 ; Coins, ap. Florex, Med.

IRIS (4'lJNi: Kasalmal), a considerable river of

Pontus, which has its souncs in the heights of Anti-

taurus in the south of Pontus. It flows at first m

a north-western direction, until reaching Cu:tm:u

it takes a western turn: it thus passes by the

towns of Meayla and Gaziura. A little above Ami-

sus it receives the ScyUx, and turns eastward; n< *r

Kupatoria the Lye us empties itself into it. Alter

thb it flows due north, and, traversing the plain of

Thcmiscyra, it empties itself into the Kuxine by four

mouths, the westernmost of which is the mint impor­

tant (Strab. xii. p. 556.) The Iris is smaller titan

the Hairs (Apollon. Rhod. ii. 368). but still a consi­

derable river, flowing through a vast extent of country,

and, according to Xcnophon (Anab. t. 6. § 3), was

three pU-thra in breadth. (Comp. Strab. i. p. 52, xii.
