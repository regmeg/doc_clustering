Eekhel (vol. ii. p. 73) speaks of only one extant

coin of Olynthus — the "type" a head of Heracles,

with the lion's skin; but Mr. Millingen has engraved

one of those beautiful Chalcidian coins on which the

"legend" OATN© surrounds the head of Apollo on

the one side, and the word XAAXIAEflN, his lvre,

on the reverse. (Cousinery, Voyage, vol. ii. p. 161;

OMANA ("Ojwi'a, J'eripl. Afar. Erythr. c. 27,

36; Marcian, PeripL c. 28, ed. Muller, 1855), a

port of some importance on the coast of Carmania,

which is noticed also by Pliny (vi. 28. s. 32). Its

position was near the modern bay of Tshubar, per­

haps where Mannert has suggested, at Cape Tanka

(v. 2. p. 421). Vincent places it a little to the E.

of Cape lask. In Ptolemy, the name has been cor­

rupted into Commana (vi. 8. § 7). [V.]

OMANA (to; "O/iafa), a deep bay on the south

coast of Arabia east of Syagree, 600 stadia in dia­

meter, according to the Periplus, bounded on the

cast by lofty and rugged mountains (ap. Hudson,

Geoff. Min. torn. i. p. 18), doubtless identical with

the Omanum emporium, which Ptolemy places in

long. 77° 40', lat. 19° 45', which must have belonged

to the Omanitae mentioned by the same geographer

(vi. 15), separated only by the Cattabani from the

abates Asaborum, doubtless the mountains men­

tioned in the Periplus. If Pas Fartak be cor­

rectly taken as the ancient Syagros, the ancient

Omana must have been fur to the west of the dis­

trict of Arabia now called by that name, and

within the territory of lladramaut. The modern

'Oman is the south-eastern extremity of the penin­

sula, and gives its name to the sea outside the

mouth of the Persian Gvlf, which washes it on the

east and south. (Gosselin, Pecherches, torn. iii.

pp. 32, 33; Vincent, iii. 16; Forster, Geogr. of

Arabia, vol. ii. pp. 173, 180, notef ) [G.W.]

OMANI or OMANNI (Aoiryioi oi 'Opavoi or

'Ofiavvo'i'), a branch of the Lygii, in the NE. of

Germany, between the Oder and the Vistula, to the

S. of the Burgundiones, and to the N. of the Lvgii

Diduni (Ptol. ii. 11. § 18). Tacitus (Germ. 43) in

enumerating the tribes of the Lygii does not mention

the Omani, but a tribe occurs in his list bearing the

name of Manimi, which from its resemblance is ge­

nerally regarded as identical with tho Omani. But

nothing certain can be said [L. S.]

Ambo, jVof. Imp. sect. 20: Eth. 'Op.6lrr]s; comp.

Aelian, Hist. An. x. 21), was a town in the

Thebaid, the capital of tho Nomos Oinbites, about

30 miles N. of Syene, and situated upon the E.

bank of the Nile; lat. 24° 6' N. Ombi was a gar­

rison town under every dynasty of Aegypt, Pharaonic,

Macedonian, and ltoman; and was celebrated for the

magnificence of its temples and its hereditary feud

with the people of Tentyra.

Ombi was the first ciiy below Syene at which

any remarkable remains of antiquity occur. The

Nile, indeed, at this portion of its course, is ill-suited

to a dense population. It runs between steep and

narrow banks of sandstone, and deposits but little

of its fertilising slime upon the drear)- and barren

shores. There are two temples at Ombi, constructed

of the stone obtained from the neighbouring quarries,
