dominion in the island. (Polyb. i. 38.) Thus, it

is mentioned in the war of b. c. 406 as one of their

principal naval stations (Diod. xiii. 88); and again

in B.C. 397 it was one of the lew cities which re­

mained faithful to the Carthaginians at the time of

the siege of Motya, (Id. xiv. 48.) In b. <■. 383 it

is u-jain noticed as the head-quarters of the Cartha­

ginians in the island (Id. xv. 17); and it is certain

that it was never taken, either by Dionysius or by

the still more powerful Agathoclos. Hut in u. c.

276, Pyrrhus, after having subdued all the other

cities in Sicily held by the Carthaginians, except

Lilybaeum and Panormus, attacked and made him­

self master of the latter city also. (Id. xxii. 10. p.

49S.) It, however, soon fell again into the bands of

the Carthaginians, who held it at the outbreak of the

First Punic War. it. c. 264. It was at this time the

most important city of their dominions in the island,

and generally made the head-quarters both of their

armies and fleets; hut was nevertheless taken with

hut little difficulty by the Roman consuls Atilius

Calat'inus and Cn. Cornelius Scipio in b. c. 254.

(Polyb. i. 21, 24, 38; Zonar. viii. 14; Diod. xxiii.

18 p. 505.) After this it became one of the prin­

cipal naval stations of the Romans throughout the

remainder of the war, and for the same reason be­

came a point of the utmost importance for their stra­

tegic operations. (Diod. xxiii. 19, 2l,xxiv. 1; Polyb.

i. 39, 55, &c.) It was immediately under the walls

id' Panormus that the Carthaginians under Hasdrubal

were defeated by L. Caccilius Metellus in B. t\ 250,

in one of the most decisive battles of the whole war.

(Polyb. i. 40; Zonar. viii. 14; Oros. iv. 9.) It was

here also that the Romans had to maintain a long-

continued struggle with Hamilcnr Barca, who had

seized on the remarkable isolated mountain called

Krcta, forming a kind of natural fortress only about

a mile and a half from Panormus [Ercta], and

succeeded in maintaining himself there for the ^p.^cc

of three years, notwithstanding all the efforts of the

Romans to dislodge him. They were in consequence

compelled to maintain an intrenched camp in front

of Panormus, at a distance of only five stadia from

the foot of the mountain, throughout this protracted

contest. (Polyb. i. 5G, 57.)

After the Roman conquest of Sicily, Panormus

became a municipal town, but enjoyed a privileged

condition, retaining its nominal freedom, and immu­

nity from the ordinary burdens imposed on other

towns of the province. (Cic. Verr. iii. 6.) It was

in consequence a flourishing and populous town, and

the place where the courts of law were held for the

whole surrounding district. (Id. ib. ii. 26, v. 7.)

Cicero notices it at this time as one of the principal

maritime and commercial citi<-s of the island. (/&.

v. 27.) In the settlement of the affairs of Sicily

which seems to have followed the war with S-xtns

Pompeius, Panormus lost its liberty, but received a

Roman colony (Strab. vi. p. 272), whence we find

it bearing in in;>eriptions the title of" Colonia Au­

gusta Panormitanorum." It would seem from Dion

Cassius that it received this colony in b. c. 20; and

coins, as well as the testimony ol Strabo, prove in­

contestable' that it became a colony under Augustus.

It is strange, therefore, that Pliny, who notices all

the other colonies founded by that emperor in

Sicily, has omitted all mention of Panormus as such,

and rank-* it merely as an ordinary municipal town.

(Plin. iii. 8. s. 14; Dion Cass. liv. 7; Kckhel, vol.

i. p. 232; Orell, fnscr. 948, 3760.) It Nub^e-

quently received an accession of military colonists

under Vespasian, and a<;ain under Hainan.

Cohm. p. 211; Zumpt, de Coltm. p. 410.) N.

im-rous inscriptions prove that it continued tf> v.r i

llnurishing provincial town throughout the

of the Roman empire ; and its name is rejrtW

mentioned in the Itineraries (/tin. Ant pp. Sfl .
