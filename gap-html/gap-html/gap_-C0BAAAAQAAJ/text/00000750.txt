tending to prove the continued importance <»f prae­

neste throughout the period of the Roman Empire.

(Ntbby, vol. ii. pp. 513—515; Foggini, I.e. pp. v.—

viii.) Other inscriptions mention the existence of a

theatre and an amphitheatre, a portico and curia,

and a spoliarium; hut no remains of any of these

edifices can he traced. (Gruler, Inter, p. 132;

Orelli, Inter. 2532; Bonnann, note 43-1.)

The celt-bratoil grammarian Verrius Placcus, al­

ready mentioned, was probably a native of Prae-

r.cste, as was also the well-known author Aelianus,

who, thongh he wrote in Greek, was a Uoman citi­

zen by birth. (Suid. t. v. Ai\tuv6s). The family

of the Anicii also, so illustrious under the Empire,

seems to have derived its origin from Praeneste, as

a Q. Anicius is mentioned by 1'liny as a magistrate

of that city as early as li. C. 304. (Plin. xxxiii. 1.

s. G.) It is probable aisu tliat in Livy (xxiii. 19)

we should read M. Anicius fur Manicius. It is re­

markable that the Praenestines appear to have had

certain dialectic peculiarities which distinguished

them from the other Latins; these are mure than

once alluded to by Plant us, as well as by later

grammarians. (Plaut. Trmvm. iii. 1. 8, True. iii.

2. 23; Quint'il. Inst i. 5. § 5G ; Fest, s. r. Nepkrtn*

tlL<, Id. s. v, Timyrr.)

The territory of Praeneste was noted for the ex­

cellence of its nuts, which are noticed by Cato.

(Ii. It. 8, 143; Plio. xvii. 13. s. 21; Naevius, ap.

Macrob. Sat iii. 18). Hence the Praenestines

themselves seem to have been nicknamed Nuculae;

though another explanation of the term is given by

FestUS, who derives it from the walnuts (nuces)

with which the Praenestine garrison of Casilinuin

is said to have been fed. (Cic. t/e Or. ii. 62; Fest.

t. p. Nucviae.') Pliny also mentions the roses of Prae­

neste as among the most celebrated in Italy; and its

wine is noticed by Atnenaeua, though it was ap­

parently not one of the choicest kinds. (Plin. xxi.

4. s. 10; Atben. i. p. 26, f.)

It is evident from the narrative of Livy (vi.

2!t) that Praeneste in the days of its independence,

like Tibur, had a considerable territory, with at

least eight smaller towns as its dependencies;

but the names of none of these are preserved to us,

and we are wholly unable to fix the limits of its ter­

ritory.

The name of Via Praenestina was given to the

road which, proceeding from Koine through CJabii

direct to Praeneste, from thence rejoined the Via

I.atina at the station near Anagnia. It will be

considered in detail in the article Via PitAENES-

PRAE'NETUS (Upa'tvtroi), a town on the cast

of liilhynia, on the north side of Mount Argautho-

nius, and at the southern entrance of the Sinus

Astacenus. It was situated 28 Unman miles to the

north-west of Nicaea; and Stoplianus 11., who calls

it TlpovtKTost states that it was founded by the

Phoenicians. If this be true, it would be a very

ancient place, which can scarcely be conceived, as it

is mentioned only by very late Writers. (Pallad. Vit.

Chrtjs. p. 75; Socrat. vi. 16; Hierocl, p. 691, where

it is called Priiirtus; Tab. Ptttlimj., where it is

written Pronetios ) According to Cedrenus (p. 457),

it was destroyed by an earthquake. Its site seems to

answer to that of Ikbrtnik. [L. S.J
