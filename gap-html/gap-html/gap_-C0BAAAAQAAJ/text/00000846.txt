placuit"), that a wall was built from the fortress

on the top of the hill down to the river, but the

cmstruction of conjungi in tins passage may be a

zeugma. It seems strange that Ancus should have

built ft wall on the right bank of the Tilwr when there

was yet none on the h-ft bank ; and it is remarkable

thai Dionymiu (iii. 45), in describing the fortification

of the Janiculum, makes no mention of a wall, nor do

we hear of any gales on this side except that of the

fortress itself. The existence of a wall, moreover,

seems hardly consistent with the accounts which we

have already given from the same author of the de­

fenceless state of the city on that side. Kiebuhr

{Ht$t. i. p. 396) rejected the notion of a wall, as

utterly erroneous, but unfortunately neglected to

give the proofs by which he had arrived at this con­

clusion. The passage from Appian (KKatStov 5'

seems to regard as decisive proves little or nothing

for the earlier periods of the city ; ami, even had

there been a vail, the passing it would not have

afforded an entrance into the city, properly so called.

II. Walls and Gates of Ait.euan and

HONORIL'S.

In the repairs of the wall by HoDOrioi all the

gates of Aurelian vanished; hence it is impossible to

say with confidence that any part of Aureliau's wall

remains: and we must consider it us represented by

that of Bonoriua. Procopius (B. G. iii. 24) asserts

that Totila destroyed all the gates; hut this is dis­

proved by the inscriptions still existing over the

Porta S. Lorenzo, as well as over the closed arch of

the Porta Moggiort; and till the time of Pope Urban

VIII. the same inscription might be read over the

OatienstS (/*. S. Paolo) and the ancient Portuensis.

It can hardly be imagined that these inscriptions should

have been preserved over restored pates. The only no­

tice respecting any of the gates of Aurelian on which

we can confidently rely is the account given by Am-

mianus Mareellinus (xvii. 4. § 14)of the carrying of

the Egyptian obelisk,which Coa&tantiUS 11.erected ill

the Circus Maxim us, through the Porta OsTIKKStS*

It may be assumed, however, that their situation

was not altered in the new works of Honoring. By

far the greater part of these gates exist at the pre­

sent day, though some of them are now walled up,

and in mast cases the ancient name has been changed

for a modern one. Hence the problem is not so

much to discover the sites of the ancient gates as

the ancient names o| tln.se stilt existing; ami these

do not admit of much doubt, with the exception of

the gates on the eastern side of the city.

Procopius, the principal authority respecting the

gates in the Aurelian (or Honorian) wall, enume­

rates 14 piincipal ones, or iruAcu, and mentions

some smaller ones by the name of wvAioev (B. G.

i. 19). The distinction, however, between these

two appellations is not very clear. To judge from

their present ap|»earance, it was not determined by

the size of the gates; and we find the Pinciana in­

differently called irv\i\ and ffoATj. (Urlichs, Class.

Mas. vol. iii. p. 196.) The conjecture of Nibby ( J/ura,

<fc. p. 317) may perhaps be correct, that the wuAai

were probably those which led to the great high­

ways. The unknown writer called the Anonymus

fcanaicdlensis, who flourished about the begiuning of

the ninth century, also mentions H gates, md hv

dudes the Pinciana among them; bat his sctssst

is not clear.

Unlike Sen ius, Aurelian did not consider theTat*

a sufficient protection; and his walls were mmtd

along its banks from places opposite to the -f«t>**s»

the walls which he built from the JuucuIoie term

or. the further shore. The wall which skirted is
