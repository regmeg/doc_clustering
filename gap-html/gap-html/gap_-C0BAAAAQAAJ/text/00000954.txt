tin? language of their O.scan subjects; indeed all the

extant inscriptions in that language may be consi­

dered as Sal>ello*Oscan, and have probably received

some influence from the language of the conquerors,

though we have no means of estimating its amount.

The original Sabines appear to have early lost the

use of their own language, and adopted the general

use of Latin; which, considering the rugged and

secluded character of their country, and their pri­

mitive habits of life, could hardly have been the

case, had the two languages been radically distinct.

On the whole, therefore, we may fairly conclude

that the Sabines were only a branch of the same

great family with the Oscans, Latins, and Umbrians,

but apparently most closely related to the last of

tie* three. Their name is generally derived from

that of Sabus, who is represented as a son of Sancus,

tlir chief tutelary divinity of the nation. (Cato, ap. I

Dion-js. ii. 49; Sil. ltal. viii. 422; Serv. ad Attn. viii. I

fi.'IS.) But another etymology given by ancient

writers derives it from their religious habits and

devotion to the worship of the gods. (Varr. ap. Fest. I

p. 343; Plin. iii. 12. s. 17.) This last derivation

in fact comes to much the same thing with tlie 1

preceding one, for the name of Sabus (obviously a I

mythological personage) is itself connected with the

Greek and with the word "sevum" found in

the Eugubine tables in the sense of venerable or

holy, just as Sancus is with the Latin " sanctus,"

"sancire," Ac. (Donaldson, /. c.)

The original abode of the Sabines was, according

to Cato, in the upper valley of the Aternus, about

Amiternum, at the foot of the loftiest group of the

Apennines. We cannot indeed understand literally,

at least as applying to the whole nation, his asser­

tion (as quoted by D'mnvsius) that they proceeded

from a village called Testrina, near Amiternum

^Cato, up. Dioni/s. i. 14, ii. 49); though tins may

have been true of the particular band or clan which

invaded and occupied Keate. Hut there is no reason

to doubt the general fact that the Sabines, at the

earliest fieri od when their name appears in history,

occupied the lofty mountain group in question with

its adjacent valleys, which, from the peculiar con­

figuration of this part of the Apennines, would afford

natural and convenient outlets to their migrations

in all directions, [Arr.sxiNi s.] The sending forth

of these migrations, or national colonies, as they

may be called, was connected with an ancient

custom which, though no; unknown to the other

nations of Italy, serins to have been more |ieculiarly

characteristic of the Sabines — the Ver Sacrum or

*" sacred spring." This consisted of dedicating, by a  
solemn vow, usually in time t-f pressure from war or

famine, all the produce of the coining year, to some

deity: Mauiers or Mars seems t" have been the one

commonly selected. The cattle born in that year

Mere accordingly sacrificed to the divinity chosen,

while the children were allowed to grow up to man's

estate, and were then sent f>ith in a. body to find

for themselves new places of abode beyond the limits

of their native country. (Strab. v. p. 2'>0; Fe>t.

S^wrmtu, p. 379: Sisenna, ap. Son. p. 322; Varr.

K. K. in. 16. § 29: Li v. xxii. 9, 10.) Such colonies

were related by tradition to have given origin to

jjjjt nations of the l'lcentes, the Sammies, and the

»ud in accordance with the notion of their

*!i>n to Mars they were reported to have  
d by a woodpecker, or a wolf, the animals
