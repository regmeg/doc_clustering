1230 TBIGCXDUM. TRICCIANA

330.) Trikkala is now one of the largest towns in

this part of Greece. The castle occupies a hill pro-

ice ting from the last falls of the mountain of

KhassiA; but the only traces of tlie ancient city

which Leake could discover were some small remains

of Hellenic masonry, forming part of the wall of the

castle, and some squared blocks of stone of the same

aces dispersed in different parts of the town. (Leake,

Northern Greece, vol. i. p. 425, seq., vol. iv. p. 287.)

TRICCIA'NA, a place in PannonU, in tlie valley

called Cariniana (ft. Ant. p. 267). It is probably

the same as the Gurtiana noticed in the Pent. Table,

as the difference in the statements about the dis­

tances amounts only to 2 miles. [L. S.J

TRICESIMAE, in Gallia, one of the places men­

tioned by Ammianus Marcel linus (xviii. 2) in the

list of those places along the Khenish frontier

which Julian repaired. Ammianus mentions Tri-

eesimae between Quadriburgiuin and Novesium.

[QlJADRIBOROIUM.] [G. L.]

TRICESIMUM, AD, in Gallia. D'Anville ob­

serves that the ancient Itins. contain many positions

with similar names, which names of places are de­

rived from the distances which they indicate from the

principal towns; for the distances within the de­

pendent territory were measured from the principal

towns. This Tricesimum is measured from Narbo

(Narbnnve), as the Jerusalem Itin. shows, on the

road to Toulouse, through Carcassonne. Trebes

on the canal of Languedoc may represent the name;

and Tricesimum mav be near that place. [G. L.]

TRICHO'NIS LACUS. [Aktolia, p. 64, a.]

TKICHO'NIUM (Tpixdnov: Etk. Tpixwuvs), a

town of Aetolia, from which the lake Trichoma de­

rived its name. [Respecting the lake, see Vol. I. p. 64,

a.] Its position is uncertain. Leake places it S. of

the lake at a place called Gavala, and Kiepert, in

his map K. of the lake. Rut since Strabo mentions

it along with Stratus as situated in a fertile plain, it

ought probably to be placed N. of the lake (Strab. x. p.

450; Pol. v. 7; Steph. Ii. k. p.). It was evidently a

place of importance, and several natives of this town

are mentioned in history. (Pol. iv. 3, v. 13, xvii. 10;

Pans. ii. 37. § 3; Leake, Northern Greece, vol. i.

p. 155.)

TRICOLOR!. [Megalopolis, p. 309.]

TRICO'MIA (TptKtafiia), * place in the eastern

part of Phrygia, on the road from Dorylncuin to

Apamea Cibotus (Ptol. v. 2. § 22; Tab. Pent), is

placed by the Table at a distance of 28 miles from

Midaeum and 21 from Pessanus. [L. S.]

TR1G0RII (TputSpioi), a people between the

Rhone and the Alps. Hannibal in his march from

the Rhone to the Alps passed into the country of

theTricorii, as Livy says [Tkicastwi]. Strabo(iv.

pp. 185, 203) says in one passage that above the

Cavares are "the VocontU and Tricorii and Iconii

and Moduli," from which we learn tliat lie considered

the Tricorii as neighbours of tlie Vocontii; and in

another passage ho says, "after the Vocontii are the

Iconii and Tricorii, and next to them the Meduli,

who occupy the highest summits of the Alps."

Some geographers concluile that tlie Tricorii must be

on the Jtrac, a branch of the [sire, in the southern

part of the diocese of Grenoble, But if the Tricorii

were in the valley of the 7>rw, we do not therefore

admit that Cannibal's march to the Alps was

through that valley. [G. L.]
