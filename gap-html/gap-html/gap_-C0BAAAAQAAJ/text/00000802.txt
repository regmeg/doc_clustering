ins a station on the road from Ticinum (Pucia) to

Augusta Taurinorum (Turin.) It is placed by the

Itineraries 36 M. 1*. from Laarnellum (LotneUo), and

3f> M, P. from Augusta or Taurini: these distances

coincide with the site of Trina Vecchio, a village a

little to the S. of the modern town of Trino, on the

left bank of the Po (Itin. Ant. p.'339; Cluver.

KIGOMAGUS (Remagen)} on the Rhine. The

Table places it between Bonna (Jiotm) and An-

tunnacuin (AnJernach). viii. from Bonna and ix.

from Antnnnacum. The Antooine Itin., which

omits RigomagOS, makes the distance xvii. from

Bonna to Antunnacum. Remagtn is on the Rhine

with the Rhine. Ukert (Gatlim, p. 518, note)

speaks of a milestone found at Rentage* with the

SIMMON (tyejyttW), a city of the tribe of

Eleutheropolis. (Onomast. s. ro. 'EptfxGuv, 'Ptfifxa.)

IIIOBE, in North Gallia, a name which appears

in the Table on a road which passes from Augusto-

magus (Senlis) through Calagum (Chailli). Jtiobe

comes after Calagum, but the distance is not given.

A road, which appears to be in the direction of a

Roman mad, runs from Chailli to Orbit a few miles

north of the Seine; and D'Anville thinks that the

name Ofbi and the distance from Kiobe to Condate

(Montereau-sur-Youne) enable us to Hx Riobe at

Orbl [Coni>ate, No. 2; Calagum.] [G. L.]

RIPA (PUn. iii. 1. s. 3, according to the Codex

Reg., though the common reading is Ripepora), a

ii. part i. p. 380.) [T. H. D.]

R1SAKDIR (P«lyb. ap. Plin. v. 1), a harbour on

the W. coast of Mauretam'a, which may be identified

with the ACRA of the Ship-journal of Hanno ("Affpa,

PeripL § 5, cd. Miiller). It now bears the name of

Agttdcr, signifying in the Berber language (Paradis,

Oictioniutire liirbrrc, p. 110) "a fortress,' and is

described as being the best roadstead along t e coast

uf Morocco. Agad&r or Santa Cruz, which was

called Guertgnessem in the time of Leo Africanus,

was walled round and strengthened by batteries in

1503 by Emanuel, king of Portugal; but was taken

from the Portuguese by the Moon in 1536. (.lack-
