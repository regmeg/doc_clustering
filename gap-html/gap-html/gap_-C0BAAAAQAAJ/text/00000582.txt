It is, however, right to observe that the district of

Uropus was frequently designated as the border

country or country over the burder (tijs irtpav yijs,

Thuc.'iii 01).

According to Dicaearchua (L c.) the Oropians

were notorious for their grasping exactions, levied

upon all imports into their country, and were for

this reason satirised by Xenon, a comic poet:—

The position of Oropus is thus defined by Strabo,

"Tlit* beginning [of Boeotia] is Oropus, and the

sacred harbour, which they call Delphinium, op­

posite to which is old Eretria in Kuboea, distant 6U

stadia. After Delphinium is Oropus at the distance

of 20 stadia, opj.n-.tte to wliicli is the present Kre-

tria, distant 4(1 stadia. Then comes I>elium."

(Strab. ix. p. 403.) The modern village of Oropo

stands at the distance of nearly two miles from the

sea, on the right brink of the Vouricni, anciently*]

the Asopus: it contains sonic fragments of ancient

buddings and sepulchral stones. There are also

Hellenic remains at the 2xdAa or wharf upon the

bay, from which persons usually embark for Kuboea:

this place is also called 4 J to us ayiovs anwroAouy.

from a ruined church dedicated to I lie 14 Holy

Apostles." Leake originally place 1 Ornpus a:

(front! and Delphinium at Skuhti but in the second

edition of his Demi he leaves the position of On'pus

doubtful. It seems, however, most probable that

Oropus originally stood upon the coast, and was re­

moved inland or.Iy for a short time. In the Pelo-

ponne-dan War Tliucydides speaks of sailing to and

anchoring at Oropus (iii. 91, viii. 95); and 1'nu-

sanias, :i>, we have already seen, expressly .states

that Oropus was upon the coast. Hence there can

be lit!Ic doubt that Skala is the site t>f Oropus and

that Ortypo is the inland site which the Oropians

occupied only for a time. It is true that the dis­

tance of Oropo from the sea is more than double the

7 stadia assigned by Diodorus, but it is jxissihle

that he may have originally written 17 stadia. If

Oropus stood at Skdla, Delphinium must have been

more to the eastward nearer the conlines of Attica.

In the territory of i tropuswas the celebrated temple

of the hero Amphiaraus. According to Pausanias

(i. 34. § 1) it was 12 stadia distant from Oropus.

Strabo [-laces it in the district of Psnphis, which

stood between Rhamnus and Oropus, and which was

subsequently an Attic dermis (ix. p. 399), Livy

calls it tlie temple of Amphilochus (xlv. 27), who,

we know from 1'ausanias. was worshipped conjointly

with Amphiaraus, Livy further de.-cribes it as a

place rendered agreeable by fountains and rivers;

w hich leads one to look for it at one of two torrents

which join the yea between Skdla and Kalamo,

which i> probably the ancient I'sophis. The m»uth

of one ofthe.se torrents is distant about a mile and

a half from Ska la ; at half a mile from tlie mouth

are some remains of antiquity. The Other torrent is

about three miles further to the eastward; on

which, at a mile above the plain, are remains of

ancient walls. This place, which is near K a la mo,

is called Marro-DhUissi, the epithet Macro (black)

distinguishing it from DhiUssi, the site of Delium.

The distance of the Hellenic remains on the first-

mentioned torrent agree with tin* 12 stadia of

Pausanias: but, on the other hand, inscriptions

have been found at Macro DhHusi and Kalamo, in

which the name of Amphiaraus occur, tfcw
