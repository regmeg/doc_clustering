TUKO'.NIUM (epoW: Eth. %p6viot,&pov'nns,

bvr«i/f). 1. The chief town of the Locri Epicne-

ikl i. situated 20 stadia from the coast and 30

tadia from Scarphtia, upon the river Boagrius,

rhich ie described by Strabo as sometimes dry, and

(Betimes flowing with a stream two ptethra in

nadth. (Strab. ix. p 436.) It is mentioned by

loin-r, who speaks of it as near the river Bcagrius.

Tt ii. 533.) It was at one time partly destroyed

» an earthquake. (Strab. i. p. CO.) At the be-

"inung of the I'eloponnesian War (n.c. 431) Thro-

iom was taken by the Athenians. (Thuc. ii. 26;

Kod. xii. 44.) In the Sacred War it was taken by

)oomarchaa, tbe Phocian general, who sold its in-

isbiunts into slavery, and hence it is called by

irvlax a Phocian city, (l)iod. xvi. 33; Aesch. it

v'aU. Leg. p. 45, 33; Scyiaz, p. 23.) (Thronium is

2. A town in Greek Illyria in the neighbourhood

iftrr tbe Trojan War by the Abantes of Euboea

al tbe inhabitants of the Locrian Thronium. It

irair territory, as appears from an epigram inscribed

THRYON, THRYOESSA. [ErtTALiuM.]

THULE (OovAi), PtoL ii. 6. § 32), a celebrated

alsnd in the Northern Ocean, discovered by tbe

uiigator Pytheas. Pytheas arrived at it after a

ravage of aix days from the Orcades, in which it

i be computed that he had accumpliched about

IflOO stadia. (I'lin. ii. 77.) According to the

i ■ junt of Pytheas, he reached the polar circle, so

I at on this island the longest day was twenty-four

wurs, and there was constant day during the six

.■iiT.er niontlis and constant night during the six

i>uter ones. It was deficient in animals, and even

h* ruost necessary fruits, but produced a little corn.

:mh tbe lime of its discovery it was regarded as

tw most northerly point of the known world.although

w farther knowledge was obtaineil respecting it;

Jal tlua view seems to be confirmed by its name,

.nee in Gothic Titl or Tittle (rtAoi. goal) denoted

r-:imtest land. (Strab. i. p. 63, ii. pp. 104,114,

r. p. 201; Agath. i. 8; Prise. Perieg. 587, aqq.;

iWla, hi. 6; Plin. ir. 16. B. 30; Tac. Ayr. 10;

Vary, dt Pytheas. p. 439; liudbeck, Allan I. i. p.

114.) Ptolemy is the only writer who places Thule

i (Treat deal further S., though he undoubtedly had

n view tbe island discovered by Pytheas; and

'rardmg to him it would seem to have been the

irgesl of the Shetland islands, or the modern

l 16. § 21, vii. 5. § 12, viii. 3. § 3> Mostmo-

-ra geographers incline to tbe opinion that Pytheas  
□east Iceland; though according to others his

Thule is to be variously sought in Norway; in

that part called Thile or Thilemark ; in Jutland,

the extreme point of which is called Thy or Tltylaml;

or in the whole Scandinavian peninsula (Maltc-

Brun, Geogr. Univ. i. p. 120; Ortclius, Theatr. Orb.

p. 103.) [T. H. D.)

TUUMATA (Bou/idTo, Ptol. vi. 7. § 33; Plin.

tL 28. a, 32; Thamatha, Not. Imp. Rom. § 22, p.

37), a town of Arabia Felix, according to Ptolemy,

and described by Pliny as distant 10 days' sail

from Petra, and subject to the king of the

Characeni.

TI1UMNA. [Tahsa]

THUNU'DROMON (eoi/woopojuw, Ptol. iv. 3.

§ 29), a Roman colony in Numidia, It seems to be

the same place as the Tynidrumense oppidum of

Pliny (v. 4. a. 4). [T. II. D.]

THU'RIA (&ovpia: Fill. eovptd-rns\ a town of

Messenia, situated in the eastern part of the southern

Messenian plain, upon the river Aris (/VdViiwa), and

at tbe distance of 80 stadia from l'harae, which was

about a mile from the coast (I'aus. iv. 31. § 1). It

was generally identified with the Homeric Antheia,

though others supposed it to beAepeia. (Paus./. c;

Strab. viii. p. 360.) It must have been a place of

considerable importance, since tbe distant Messenian

gulf was even named after it (6 Bovptdrnf aoAror,

Strab. I.e.). It was also one of the chief towns of

the Lacedaemonian Perioeci after the subjugation of

Mea-scnia ; and it was here that the Third Messenian

War took its rise, n. c. 464 (Thuc. i. 101). On the

restoration of the Mcsscnians by Epaminoudas.Tliuria,

like the other towns in the country, was dependent

upon the newly-founded capital Messcne ; but after

the capture of this city by the Achaeans in B. c. 182,

Thuria, l'harae, and Abia joined the Achaean League

as independent members. (Polyb. xxv. 1.) Thuria

was annexed to Laconia by Augustus (Paus. /. c);

but it was restored to Messenia by Tiberius. [Mes-

sks'IA, p. 345, a.] Pausanus found two cities of

this name. The Thuriatae had descended from tbe

summit of the lofty hill of the upper city to dwell

upon the plain ; but without abandoning altogether

the upper city, where a temple of the Syrian goddeea

still stood within the town walls (Paus. iv. 31. § 2).

There are considerable remains of both places. Those

of Upper Thuria are on the hill of the village called

Paleokastro, divided from tbe range of mountains

named MakrypUi by a deep ravine and torrent, and

which commands a tine view of the plain and gulf.

The remains of the walls extend half a mile along

the summit of the hill. Nearly in the centre of the

ruins is a quadrangular cistern, 10 or 12 feet deep,

cut out of the rock at one end, ami on the other side

constructed of masonry. The cistern was divided into

three parts by two cross walls. Its whole length is

29 paces ; the breadth half as much. On tbe highest

part of the ridge there are numerous ruins, among

which are those of a small Doric temple, of a hard

brown calcareous stone, in which are cockle and muscle

shells, extremely perfect. In the plain at Paled I.utra

are the ruins of a large Roman building, standing in the

middle of fig and mulberry grounds. Leake observes

that "it is in an uncommon state of preservation, part

even of the roof still remaining. The walls are 17 feet

high, formed of equal courses of Roman tiles and

mortar. The roof is of nibble mixed with cement.

Tbe plan does not seem to be that of a bath only, aa

the name would imply, though there are many ap­

pearances of the building having contained bathe: it

seems rather to have been the palace of some Roman
