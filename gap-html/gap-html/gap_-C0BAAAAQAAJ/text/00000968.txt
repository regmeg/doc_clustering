880 SALASSI. SALARIA.

upon, the Salapia mentioned by Pliny and Ptolemy

its well as Strabo, must bare been the new town, and

not tlie original city <if the name. (Strut), vi. p. 284;

I'lin. ii'i. 12. s. 17; Ptol. iii. 1. § 16.) The Liber

Coloniaruio also speaks of it as a colony adjoining

the sea-coast, which doubtless refers to the new town

of the name. Tin's does not, however, seem to have

ever risen into a place of much importance, and

the name subsequently disappears altogether.

Extensive ruins of Salapia are slill visible on the

southern shore of the J.-nf/n ifi S/tlpi, in a tract of

country now almost wholly desolate. They evidently

belong to a city of considerable size and importance,

and must therefore be those of the ancient Apulian

city. This is further confirmed by the circumstance

that the coins of Salapia, which of course belong to

the period of its independence, are frequently found

on the spot. (Swinburne's Traveli, vol. i. p. 81.)

The site of the Roman town founded by M. Uostilius

is said to be indicated by some remains on the sea­

shore, near the Torre di Salpi. (Romanelli, vol. ii.

p. 201.)

The lagune still called the Logo diSalpi is about

12 miles in length by about 2 in breadth. At its

eastern extremity, where it communicates with the

sea by an artificial cut, are extensive salt-works,

which are considered to he the representatives of

these noticed in the Itineraries under the name of

Salinae. It is by no means certain (though not

improbable) that these ancient salt-works occupied

the same site as the modern ones ; and the distances [

given in the Itineraries along this line of coast, being

in anv case corrupt and confused, afford no clue to

their identification, (/tin. Ant. p. 314; Tub. I'tut.')

It is probable that the name of Salapia itself is eon-!

nected with sal, the htgune having always been well

adapted for the collection of salt.

The coins of Salapia,as well as those of Arpi and j

Camtsium, have Greek legends, and indicate the |

strong influence of Greek ait and civilisation, though

apparently al a late period, none of them being of an

archaic stvle. The magistrates' names which occur

on them (AAZOS, I1TAA02. &c.) are, on the con-

trurv, clearly of native origin. (Mommsen, U. /. D.

pp. 82, 83.) [E. H. Ii.]

town of the Bastitani, in the SIC. part of Hisjiania

Tarraconensis. According to IMiny it was a K<>man

colony. ^Colonia Salariensis, iii. 3. s. 4.) Ukert

The Salassi are commonly reckoned a

people, yet there are reasons which render it rai

probable that they were in fact, like their nor-a*

the Taurini, a Ligurian race The Ligunaasr^

seem, at a very early period, to have spread tin
