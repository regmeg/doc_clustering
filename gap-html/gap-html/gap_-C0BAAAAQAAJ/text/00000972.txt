SALMONE. [Samonium Promontokitjm.]

SALMYCA (Zd\fiuKat Steph. li. /. c), a city of

Spain near the Pillars of Hercules; perhaps in the

Campus Spartiarius near Carthafro Nova, if the

reading of Brodaeus in Oppian {Cyneg. iv. 2:22) is

correct. (Comp. Ukert, ii. pt. i. p. 402.) [T. H. I).]

<r6s, Pto). iii. 11. § 4; Halmydessos, Plin. [v. 11. s. 18;

Mela, it. 2. § 5), a coast-town or district of Thrace,

on the Euxine, about 60 miles N\V. from the

entrance of the Bosporus, probably somewhere in

the neighbourhood of the modem ASidjeh. The

eastern offshoots of the Haemus here come very close

to the shore, which they divide from the valley of

the Hebrus, The people of Sahnydes&us were thus

cut oft' from communication with the less barbarous

portions of Thrace, and became notorious for their

Nivage and inhuman character, which harmonised

well with that of their country, the coast of which

w.is extremely dangerous. Aeschylus {From. 726)*

describes Salmydessus as " the nipped jaw of the

sea, hostile to sailors, step-mother of ships;" and

Xenophon {A nab. vii. 5. § 12, seq.) informs us,

that in his time its people carried on the business

of wreckers in a very systematic manner, the coast

heitig marked out into portions by means of posts

erected along it, and those to whom each portion

was assigned having the exclusive right to plunder

all vessels and persons cast upon it. This plan, he

says, was adopted to prevent the bloodshed which

had frequently been occasioned among themselves by

their previous practice of indiscriminate plunder.

Strabo (vii. p. .'119) describes this portion of tlie

coast of the Euxine as "desert, rocky, destitute of

harbours, and completely exposed to the nortli

winds;" while Xenophou (Z. c.) characterises the sta

adjoining it as " full of shoals." The earlier writers

appear to speak of Salmydessus as a district only,

but in later authors, as Apoliodurus, Pliny, and

Mela, it is mentioned as a town.

Little is known respecting the history of this

place. Herodotus (iv. 93) states that its inhabi­

tants, with some neighbouring Thracian tribes, sub­

mitted without resistance to Darius when he was

marching through their country towards the Danube.

When the remnant of the Greeks who had followed

Cyrus the Younger entered the service of Seuthes,

one of the expeditions in which they were employed

under Xenophon was to reduce the people ol Salmy­

dessus to obedience; a task which thev seem to

* In this passage the poet, strangely enough,  
places Salmydessus in Asia Minor, near the Ther-

modon. Virgil makes a mistake the converse of

this iu calling the Thermodon a Thracian river;—

"Threiciac flumina Thermodontis,"

(Aen. xi. 659);

unless, indeed, as is possible, the epithet is intended

to indicate merely the supposed original abode of the
