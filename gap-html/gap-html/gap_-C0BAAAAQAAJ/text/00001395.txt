VINDIXUM. 1311 VrXTIUM.

Gallia, is mentioned in the Maritime Itin. after Ux-

urU and Sin* or Sena. Miiltllo age documents

prove that the island of Belle-lie was once named Gut-

del. Mini this is the name Vindilis, the interchange

of Go, or G and W or V being common. [Vapix-

ci.jc] Though this is the only evidence, it is suffi­

cient, for the names agree, and Belle-ile is not likely

to hare been omitted in the Itin., when smaller

islands along the coast are mentioned. [G. L.]

VIXDINUM. [Suimdixum.]

VINDIUS MONS (OtfiroW Spot, Ptol. vii. 1.

§ 28), a chain of mountains in Hindustan, extending

XK. and SW. nearly, along the N. bank of the

Namadus (now Nerbudda), in lat. 21°. long. 117°

30'. They are now known by the name of the Vtndhi/a

Ml., and form the principal watershed of the Ner-

budda and TapH, which flow into the Indian Ocean,

a little to the N. of Bombay, and of the Sonne and A n-

tiomnti, which are great tributaries of the Ganges. [V.]

Vl'NDlUS or VINNIUS (Otbfta* «poi, Ptol. ii.

6. § 21), a mountain in Hispania Tarraconensis,

which ran in a W. direction from the Saltus Vas-

••"Hum and formed the boundary between the Can-

Ubri and the Astures. It formed, therefore, the

W. portion of the Cantabrian chain. The Iberus

had its sooroe in it. [T. H. I > j

VINDOBALA,a station on the wall of Hadrian in

Britain, which was garrisoned by the Cohors I. Frixa-

gorum. Camden (p. 1090) identifies it with Walls-

End; whilst Henley (p. 105) and others take it to

be Kutchetler. (Not. Imp.; Geo. Rav. r. 31.)

VINDOBO'NAor YEXDOBOXA (OihrJoiWa:

IVeaaa), a town on the Danube in Upper Pannonia,

was originally a Celtic place, but afterwards became

a Roman inunicipiam, as we learn from inscriptions.

(Grater, InscripL p. 4.) This town, which accord-

ing to Ptolemy (ii. 15. § 3) for some time bore

the name of Julioboaa ('IouAio'sWa), was situated

at the foot of lions Cetius, on the road running

along the right bank of the river, and in the course

of time becjune one of the most important military

kUtiona on the Danube; for after the decay of Car-

nunturn it was not only the station of the principal

part of the Danubian fleet, but also of the Legio

x. Gemina. (It. Ant. pp. 233,248,261,266; Tab.

rent.; Aurel. Vict, de Caet. 16; Agathem. ii. 4;

1.inland. Get. 50, where it is railed Vindotnina.)

Vindobona suffered severely during the invasion of

:he Uuns under Attila, yet continued to be a

loarisbing place, especially under the dominion of

he Longobards. (Jornand. /. c) It is well known

hat the emperor M. Aurelius died at Yindobona.

VINDOGLA'DIA, a place in Britannia Romana,

•mbably in the territory of the Belgae on the road from

r'enta Bclgarum to Isca Dumnoniorum. (/tin. Ant.

ip. 483, 486.) The Geogr. liar. (v. 31) calls it Bin-

l^ladia- Sime place it at Pentridge, near Old

irrum, where are remains of Roman fortification*,

.'aroden, however (p. 61). identifies it with Winburn,

jtd Honley (p. 472) with Cranbunt. [T. II. D.]

VlNI>OLAXA, a station on UadriAn'a liuundary

rail in Britain, where the Cohort lv. Gallorum lay

1 garrison. (Not. Imp.) By the Geo. Rav. (v. 31)

: u> railed Vindnlanda. Camden (p. 1087) identifies

: with Old Winchester, Hondey (p. 89, &c.) with

Mile Ciesters. [Vallum Rumaxum.] [T.U.D.J

VIXDOMAGUS (OinMnayos), in Gallia Narbo-

nensis, one of the two cities which Ptolemy (ii. 10.

§ 10) assigns to the Volcae Arecomici. There is

nothing to determine the jKeition of Vindomagus,

except the fact that there is a town Vigan, where

some remains have been found. Vigan is NW.

of Nismes, and on the southern border of the Ce-

vennes. [G. L.]

VINDOMIS or VINDOMUM, a place belonging

probably to the Belgae in Britannia Romana on the

road from Venta Belgarum to Calleva. (Itin. Ant.

pp. 483, 486.) Horaley (p. 459) identifies it with

Farnham ; others have sought it at E. Sherborne,

and at Whitchurch. [T. H. D.]

VINDOMORA, a town of the Brigantes in the

N. part of Britannia Romana. (Itin. Ant. p. 464.)

It is commonly identified with Ebchester at the

NW. boundary of Durham (Horsley, p. 398), where

there are remains of a fort, and where Roman anti­

quities have been discovered. (Cf. Camden, p. 1086;

rhilot. Tram. No. 278.) [T. H. D.]

VINDONISSA, in Gallia, is mentioned by Tacitus

(/Kit. iv. 61, 70). It was the station of the twenty -

first legion, a. D. 71, which entered Rhaetia from

Vindonissa. The place is Wmdisch, in the Swiss

canton of Aargau, near the junction of the Aurt

licuss, and Limmath. Vindonissa was once a large

place, and many Roman remains and coins have been

found there. In the Bdrlisgrube there are traces of

an amphitheatre, and on the road from Brameck-

berg to Kvnigifelden the remains of an aqueduct

The name of the xxi. Legion has been discovered in

inscriptions found at Windiich. Near Windisch is

the former convent and monastery of Kunigi/tlden,

where some of the members of the Habsburg family

are buried. Several *Roman roads help to fix the

position of Vindonissa. The Table places it at

the distance of xxiL from Augusta lUuracorum

(Augst) [Augusta Rauracokum] ; and another

road went from Vindonissa past Vitodurum [Vito-

dubum] to Arbor Felix in Rhaetia. Vindonissa is

named Vindo in a Panegyric of Constantine by Eu-

menius, and Castrum Vindonissense in Maxima Se-

quanorum in the Xotitia of the Gallic Provinces.

When Christianity was established in these parts,

Vindonissa was the see of the first bishopric, which

was afterwards removed to Constant. In the

third and fourth ceuturies Vandals and Alemanoi

damaged the town. The Uuns afterwards ravaged

Vindonissa, and Childebert king of the Franks de­

stroyed it in the sixth century. (D'Anville, Notice,

J-c.; F.rnesti, Note on Tacit Hist ir. 70; Neige-

banr. Neuestes Gcmulde der Schweiz.') [G. L.]

VIXIOLAE, a place of the Oretani in Uispania

Tarraconensis, between Acatucci and Mentesa Bastiu.

(Itin. Ant. p. 402.) Variously identified with IIinn.

jares and as a place on the river Borneo. [T. 11. D.J

VIXXIUS. [VixDtua.]

VINO'VIA (in Pto|. OiuWior, ii. 3. § 16), n

town of the Brigantes in the N. of Britanm a

Romana. (Itin. Ant. p. 465.) Now Binchejl, r

near Bishop Auckland, with remains of Roman

walls and other antiquities. (Camden, p. 945.) In

the Not. Imp. and by the Geogr. Rav. (v. 31) it is

called Vinonia. [T. H. D.]
