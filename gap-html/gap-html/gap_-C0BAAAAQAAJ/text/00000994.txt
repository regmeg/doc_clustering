of the seven islands of Zenobia, which are identified

with the islands of Kurian Murian. The island of

Sarapis is therefore correctly placed by IVAnville

at Mozeira. It is described in the Periplus as

about 120 stadia distant from the coast, and about

200 stadia wide. It lud three villages, and was inha­

bited by the sacred caste of the IchthyophagL They

spoke Arabic, and wore girdles of cocoa leaves. The

islaud produced a variety and abundance of tortoises,

and was a favourite station for the merchant vessels

of Cane. [G. AW]

SARA'VUS, a river of Gallia, a branch of the

Mosella (Motel). The Itins. place the Pons Saravi

on the Saravus, on a road from Divodurum (Afetz)

to Argentoratum (Strassburg). [Pons Saravi.]

The Saravua is mentioned in the poem of Auso-

nius on the Mosella (v. 367): —

"Naviger undisona dudum me mole Saravus

Tota veste vocat, longum qui distulit amnem,

Fessa sub Augustis ut volveret ostia muris."

The Saravus is the Sarre, which joins the Afostl

on the right bank a few miles above Augusta Trc-

virorum (Trier). In an inscription the river is

named Sarra. [G. L-]

SAKBACUM (2dp§aKov, Ptol. iii. 5. § 29), a

town of Sarmatia, upon an affluent of the Tanais,

probably a Graecised form of the Slavonic Srbec.

SARDKMISUS, a southern branch of Mount

Taurus on the frontiers of Pisidia and Pamphylia,

extending as far as Phaselis; it is also connected

with Mount Climax on the frontiers between Milyas

and Pisidia Proper. (Pomp. Mela, i. 14; Plin. v.

20.) [L.S.]

SARDE'NE (SopSt'n;), a mountain of Mysia, on

the northern bank of the Hermus, in the neighbour­

hood of Cyme; at its foot was the town of Neon-

teichos. (Horn. Ep. i. 3; Vit, Horn. 9.) [L. S.]

SARDES (2ap5eii or 2ap5ty: Eik. SapSiewds),

tlie ancient capital of the kingdom of Lydia, was

situated at the northern foot of Mount Tmolus, in a

fertile plain between this mountain and the river

Hermus, from which it was about 20 stadia distant.

(Arrian, A nab, i. 17.) The small river Pactolus, a

tributary of the Hermus, flowed through the agora

of Sardes. (Herod, v. 101.) This city was of more

recent origin, as Strabo (xiii. p. 625) remarks, than

the Trojan times, but was nevertheless very ancient,

and had a very strong acropolis on a precipitous

height. The town is first mentioned by Aeschylus

{Pert, 45); and Herodotus (i. 84) relates that it

was fortified by a king Meles, who, according to the

Chronicle of Eusebius, preceded Candaules. The

city itself was, at least at first, built in a rude

manner, and the houses were covered with dry

reeds, in consequence of which it was repeatedly

destroyed by fire; but the acropolis, which some of

the ancient geographers identified with the Homeric

Hyde (Strab. xiii. p. 626; comp. Plin. v. 30; Eu-

stath. ad Dion. Per. 830), was built upon an almost

inaccessible rock, and surrounded with a triple wall.

In the reign of Ardys, Sardes was taken by the

Cimmerians, but they were unable to gain possession

of the citadel. The city attained its greatest pro­

sperity in the reipn of the last Lydian king, Croesus.

After the overthrow of the Lydian monarchy, Sardes

became the residence of the Persian satraps of

Western Asia. (Herod, v 25; Paus. iii. 9. § 3.)

On the revolt of the Ioniaus, excited by Aristagoras

and Histiaeus, the Ionian*, assisted by m Ath*3_u

force, took Sardes, except the citadel. »hka «a

The city then was accidentally set mtire, v-.i ^"t

easily combustible materials. After thia erect d»

determined him to wage war against Alb*

Xerxes spent at Sardes the winter pecediae a»
