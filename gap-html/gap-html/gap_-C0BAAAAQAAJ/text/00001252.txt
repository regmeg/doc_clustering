1166 THESSALIA. THESSALIA.

af/yvpohtvris (//. ii. 753); though, as Leake has re-

marked, the [K>et carries )iIs flattery to an extreme

in comparing to silver the white hue of its turbid

waters, derived entirely from the earth suspended in

them. (Northern Greece, vol. iv. p. 291.)

The principal rivers of Thessaly, according to

Herodotus (vii, 129), are the Peneius, Apidanus,

Onochonus, Enipeus and Pamisus. The four latter

livers all flow from the S. Of tiie.se the moet im­

portant is the Enipeus, now called the Fersaiiti,

which flows through the plain of Pharsalus, and

falls into the Peneius near Piresiae in the lowest

part of the plain. The Apidanus, now called

Vryaidy into which the Cuarius (Sofadhitiko) falls,

is a tributary of the Enipeus. [Enipeus.] The

Pamisus, now called t he BliuH or Pilinri, also

join* the Peneius a little to the YV. of the Enipeus.

The Onochonus, wjiicli is probably the same as the

Onchestus, flows into the lake Boebeis and not into

the Peneius. [For details, see Vol. II. p. 483, a.]

The chief tributary of the Peneius on the N. is the

Titaresius, now culled EUusonitiko or Xeraghi, which

rises in Mt. Titarus, a part of the Cambunian range,

and joins the main stream between Larissa and the

vale of Tempe. Homer relates (//. ii. 753, eeq.)

that the waters of the Titaresius did not mingle with

those of the Peneius, but floated upon the surface of

the latter like oil upon water, whence it was regarded

as a branch of the infernal river Styx. (Comp.

Lucan, vi. 375.) Leake calls attention to the fact

that Strabo (ix. p. 441), probably misled by the

epithet (apyvpoS'tyrjs) applied by the poet to the

Peneius, has reversed the true interpretation of the

poet's comparison of the Peneius and the Titaresius,

supposing that the Peneius was the pellucid river,

whereas the apparent reluctance of the Titaresius to

mingle with the Peneius arises from the former

being clear and the latter muddy. (Northern

(Jreece, iii. p. 396, iv. p. 296) The Titaresius

was also called Eurotas (Strab. vii, p. 329) and

Hon us or Orcus (Plin. iv. 8. s. 15).

The plain of Thessaly is the most fertile in all

Greece. It produced in antiquity a large quan­

tity of corn and cattle, which supported a nu­

merous population in the towns, and especially a

rich and proud aristocracy, who were at frequent

feuds with one another and much given to luxury

and the pleasures of the table (cTrci yap 5?} irA.«i-

(TTtj aTa|fa Kal a.Ko\a<rta, Plat. Crit. 15; Allien,

xii. p. 564; Theopomp. ap, Atfim. vi. p. 260;

Dem. Olynth, p. 16). The Thessalian horses were

the finest in Greece, and their cavalry was at

all times efficient; but we rarely read of their

infantry. The nobles, such as the Aleuadae of

Larissa and the Scopadae of Crannon, supplied the

poorer citizens with horses; but there was no class

of free equal citizens, from which the hoplites were

drawn in other Grecian states. (See Grote, Hut

of (irtece, vol. ii. p. 367.) Hence the political power

was generally either in the hands of these nobles or

of a single man who established himself as despot.

The numerous flocks and herds of the Scopadae at

Crannon are alluded to by Theocritus (/</, xvi. 3(>),

and the wealth of the Thessalian nobles is fre­

quently mentioned by the ancient writers.

Thessaly is said to have been originally known by

the names of Pyrrha, Aemonia, and Aeolis. (Uhian.

ap. Sehvl. Rhod. iii. 1089; Steph. B. s. v. Aifwtria;

Herod, vii. 176.) The two former appellations be­

long to mythology, but the latter refers to the time

when the country was inhabited by the Aeolian

Pelasgi, who were afterwards expelM ftr tr*
