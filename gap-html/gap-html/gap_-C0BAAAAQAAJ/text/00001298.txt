city of Lycia. It is not often mentioned by ancient

writers, but we know from Artemidorus {up. Strab.

xiv. p. 665) that it was one of the six cities form­

ing the Lycian confederacy. Strain only remaiks

further that it was situated on the road to Cihyra.

(Comp. Plin. v. 28; Ptol. v. 3. § 5; Steph. B. «. v.;

Hierocl. p. 659.) Until recently the site of this

town was unknown, though D'Anviile liad correctly

conjectured that it ought to be looked for in the val­

ley of the Xanthus. Sir C. Fellows was the first mo­

dem traveller who saw and described its beautiful

remains, the identity of which is established beyond

a doubt by inscriptions. These ruins exist in the

upper valley of the Xanthus, at a little distance

from its eastern bank, almost due north of the city

of Xanthus, and about 5 miles from the village of

Duover. They arc, says Sir Charles, very extensive,

Consisting of extremely massive buildings, suited

only for palaces; the design appears to be Roman,

but not the mode of building nor the inscriptions.

The original city must have been demolished in very

early times, and the finely wrought fragments are

now seen built into the strong walls, which have

fortified the town raised upon its ruins. The thea­

tre was large, and the must highly and expensively

finished thnt he had seen; the seats not only are of

marble, but the marble is highly wrought and has

been polished, and each seat has an overhanging

cornice often supported by lions* paws. There are

also ruins of several other extensive buildings with

columns; but the most striking feature in the place

is the perfect honeycomb formed in the sides of the

acropolis by excavated tombs, which are cut out of

the rock with architectural ornaments, in the form

of triangles, &c, some showing considerable taste.

TMARUS. [Dodoha, p. 783, b.]

TMOLUS (T^wAos), a mountain range on the

(south of Sard OS, forming the watershed between the

basins of the Hermus in the north and the Cayster

in the south, and being connected in the east with

Mount Messogis. It was said to have received its

name from a Lydian king Timolus, whence Ovid

{Met, vi. 16) gives this name to the mountain it­

self. Mount Tmolus was celebrated for the ex­

cellent wine growing on its slop's (Virg. (ieorg. n.

97; ixurv.P/ioen. 602; Kurip. Bacch. 55,64; Strab.

xiv. p. 637; Plin. v. 30). It was equally rich in

metals ; and the river I'actolus, which had its source

in Mount Tmolus, at one time carried from its in­

terior a rich supply of gold. (Strab. xiii. pp. 591,

610, 625; Plin. xxxiii. 43; comp. Horn. //. ii. 373;

Aeach. Vers. 50; Herod, i. 84, 93, v. 101; Ptol. v.

2. § 13; Dion. Per. 831.) On the highest summit

of Mount Tmolus, the Persians erected a marble

watch-tower commanding a view of the whole of the

surrounding country (Strab. xiii. p. 625). The Turks

now call the mountain Bouz Dagh. (Kichter, Wall-
