1084 TAGAEA. TAKNARUM.

Taenarug aperta umbrit, Lacan, ix. 36.) There

is a slight difference between Strabo anil Pausauias

in the position of the cave; the former placing it

near the temple, which agrees with present appear­

ances (see below); the latter describing the cave it

self as the temple, before which stood a statue of

Poseidon. Among the many dedicatory offerings to

Poseidon the most celebrated was the brazen statue

of Arion seated on a dolphin, which was still extant

in the time of Pausauias. (Herod, i. 23, 24.) The

temple was plundered for the first time by the

Aetoliaus. (Polyb. ix. 34.)

Taenarum is aaid to have taken its name from

Taenarus, a son either of Zens or I cart tut or Klatus.

(Pans. iii. 14. §2; Steph. B. s.v.; Schol. ad Apoll.

IxIuhI. i. 102.) Iiochart derives tin? word from the

Phoenician tiruir "rupees" {(leograph.Sacra, p.4o!t);

and it is not, improbable that the Phoenicians may

have had a settlement on the promontory at an early

[•uriod.

Pausanias (iii. 25. § 4) mentions two harbours

in connection with the Taenarian promontory, called

respectively Psamathus (Yajuo0ot>y),and the Har-

ltouu of Achilles (o Xi/ij/v A^tAAetos). Scylax

(p. 17) also mentions these two harbours, and de­

scribes them as situated back to back (airi'jriryos).

Strabo (viii. p. 373) speaks of the former of these

two harbours under the name of Ahathi's ('Ajua-

Oq'vs), but omits to mention the Harbour of Achilles.

It would appear that these two harbours are the

J'ovto Qttaglio and the port of I'nthy mentioned

above, as these are the two njo>t important in the

peninsula. Leake identifies Psamathus with Quaglio,

and the Harbour of Ac!lilies with Vatfiy, but the

trench Commission reverse these positions. We

have, however, no doubt that Leake is correct; for

the ancient remains above the Porto Quaglio, the

monastery on the heights, and the cultivated slopes

Mud levels, show that the Taenarian population lias

in all aires been chiefly collected here. Moreover,

no ancient writers sjwak of a town in connection

with the Harbour of Aehilles, while Strabo and

others describe Amathus or Psamathus jus a iroAu.

(Steph. 11. $.v. Vau.a&ovs; cf. Aeschin. Kp. 1; Plin.

iv. 5. s. 8.) If we were to take the description of

Svylax literally, Psamathus would be Porto Quaglio,

and the Harbour of Achilles Porto Mamndri; and

accordingly, they are so identified by Ourtius ; but

it is impossible to believe that the dangerous creek of

Marmtb'i is one of the two harbours so specifically

mentioned both by Scylax and Pausanias.

The remains of the celebrated temple of Poseidon

Ktill exist at Asoinato, or Kuttthmes, close to C.

Matapdn on the eastern side. They now form part

of a ruined church; and the ancient Hellenic wall

may be traced on one side of the church. Leake

observes that the church, instead of fating to the

east, as Greek churches usually do, faces south­

eastward, towards the head of the port, which is

likely to have been the aspect of the temple. No

remains of columns have been found. A few paces

north-east of the church is a large grotto in the

rock, which appears to be the cave through which

Hercules was supposed to have dragged Cerberus;

but there is no appearance of any subterranean

descent, as bad been already remarked by Pausanias.

In the neighbourhood there are several ancient

cisterns and other remains of antiquity.

J here were celebrated marble quarries in the

Taenarian peninsula. (Slrab. viii. p. .'567.) Pliny

describes the Taenarian marble as black (xxxvi.

IB. s. 29,22. s. 43); but Sexto* Empir.
