largest river of Lusitania, and is navirable for 800

stadia. According to Aethirus later (p. 17), it has

a course of 310 miles; but its real course is about

120 miles. The river was said to have derived its

name from the minium, or vermilion, carried down

by its waters. (Justin, xliv. 3.) According to

Strabn(i.c.) it was originallycalled Hakmm (BaTm);

but as this name docs not occur elsewhere, it has

been conjectured that Bafm is a false reading for

NaiSir. or NtjSu, mentioneil by Ptolemy (ii. 6. § 1)

and Mela (iii. 1). The Nakbis is a river falling

into the Ocean between the Minius and the Durius;

and it is supposed that I'oseidonius, whom Strabo

followed, confounded this river with the Minius.

(Groskurd's Srrnoo, vol. i. p. 260.) Nl/uos, in

Appian (f?i*p 72). is clearly only a false reading

for Mivios. The Minius is also mentioned by Ptol.

MIXXAGARA (Mivv&yapa, Arrian, Peripl. p.

24; Mivaydpa. Ptol. vii. 1. § 6'1), the chief town

of the district lying between the Xarnadus and

Indus, which towards the sea was known gencrically

by the name of Indo-Srythia. Its exact position

cannot now be determined; hence, some have sup­

posed that it is represented by Tatta, near the

months of the Indus, which is said to be called by

the native Raj puts. Sa-Miitagw. (Kilter, Erdkunde.

vol. v. p. 475.) Tlicre is little doubt that the name

expresses the "city of Min," nagara being a common

Sanscrit word for city, and Isidore of Charax men­

tioning a town called Min in this exact locality.

(Parth. p. 9 ; Lassen. Penlap. Indie, p. 56.) [V.]

MIXXITH, a town on the E. of Jordan, in the

country erf" the Ammonites (Jitdff?st xi. 33), cele­

brated for its com, which was sold for export in the

markets of Tyre, (Ezech. xxvii. 17.) The proper

name docs not occur in the LXX. in either of these

passages, reading in the former Arnon (Alex. 2«-

pwtld), and translating a corrupt reading in the

latter by pipu-v, after airov, as in the same passage

they represent the proper name Pannag by Kanlat.

Its situation, as Hcland has remarked (PalaeMina,

8. v. p. 899), dermis on the two questions, (1) of

tin1 line of march followed by Jephtha, and (2) of

the existence of two Aroers. There is no proof of

tin- latter hypothesis; and the course of the narra­

tive seems to demand that the former question

should be resolved in favour of a course from N.

to S.; which would oblige us to look for Jlin-

nith some distance south of Aroer, which wai situ­

ated, we know, on the river Arnon. [Arxon;

Aiuikk.] Josephus names it Maniathe (MariaOn),

but gives no clue to its positi'rti, further than that

it was in Ammanitis. Eusebius places it at Maan-

iih (Matm'0), iv. M. P. from Ksbus (Hcshbon), on

the road to Philadelphia (Ononuut. $. v. M<voWj0;

St. Jerome, Mennith): but this does not accord with

the above notifications of its site. [G. \V.]

M1NXODUXUM, is in the country of the Hel-

Canton of Vaud, on the road from Bern to /yiu-

'MINTHE. [Ems, p. 817, b.]

MINTUKXAE (jnarrovpvai. Ptol.; HirrmVv,

Strab.: Eth. Miyrovprfotos, Plut; Mintaroensa),

a city of Lutimn, in the more extendod mv of

that term; but originally a city of the Aosouiav,

situated on the right bank of the Liris(6<tr>pfta>v>),

about 3 miles from the sea. It was on the lis*

of the Appian Way, which here crossed the Lin*.

(Strab. v. p. 233.) The name of Mintonutr is rjr»t

mentioned in history during the great Latin War,

ii. c. 340—338. when it afforded a refuge to ths

Latin forces nfter their defeat in Campania. (Li».

viii. 10.) It was not, however, at that time a Looa

city, but belonged to tlw Ausonions, who appear to

have been then in alliance with the Latins arid

Campanians. Kor, in B.C. 315, Livy telU us lint

there were three cities of the Ausonians, Auscm,

Mintumac, and Vescia, which had declared them­

selves hostile to Rome after the battle of' L*atu!*«,

but were again betrayed" into the bonda of the Ro­

mans by some of the young nobles in each, and tfaa

inhabitants unsparingly put to the sword. (Lit.

ix. 25.) Not many years later, in a. c S96. a

Roman colony was established at Mintumac, at la*

same time witli one at Sinuessa, a bltle further uV>« a

the coast: they were both of them of the class cmlted

"Coloniac Maritimae," with the rights of Kouiac

citizens (Liv. x. 21; Veil. Pat. i. 14): and »m

obviously designed to maintain and secure th*- otv

munications of the Romans with Campania. l>nnnc

the Second Punic War both Mintnmae and Sinu?»*a

were among the colonies which endeavored, tu>i

without snecess, to establish their exemption frwn

the obligation to furnish military levies (Lit. zxtu.

38); and again, during the war with Antiuriraa

(b. c. 191), they attempted, with equal ill inmw,

to procure a similar exemption frmn providing re.

cruits and supplies for the naval servica. (14.

xxxvi. 3.) Minturnae was situated an the hwrVva

of an extensive marsh, which rendered the city aow

healthy, but its situation on the Appian Way nu>t

have contributed to maintain its pro»]*rity: ar*i :1
