334 MYGDONIA. MYLAE.

MYGDO'NIA (MvySovfa: Eth. MvySoves, Steph.

P>.), a district of Macedonia, which comprehended

the plains round Thossalonica, together with tlie

valleys "f Klmili and Bvsikia, extending towards

the E. as far as the Axius (Herod, vii. 123). and

including the Lake Bolbe to the E. (Thuc. i. 58.)

To the N. it was joined by Crcstonia, for the Eclu-

dorus, which flowed into the gulf near the marshes

of the Axius, had its sources in Crestonia (Herod,

vii. 124). while the pass of Anion or Arethusa

■was probably the boundary of Mygdonia towards

Iiisaltia. The maritime part of Mygdonia formed

a district called Amphaxitis, a distinction which

iirst occurs in Polybius (v. 98), who divides all the

great plain at the head of the Thermaic gulf into

Anipiiaxitis and Bottiaea, and which is found three

centuries later in Ptolemy (iii. 13. § 36). The

latter intr<>duces Amphaxitis twice under the sub­

divisions of Macedonia,— in one instance placing

under that name the months of the Eehidorus and

Axius, with Thessalouica as the only town, winch

agrees with Polybius, and particularly with Strabo

(vii. p. 330). In the other place, Ptolemy includes

Stagura and Arethusa in Ampi.axitis, which, it' it

he correct, would indicate that a portion of Ani­

piiaxitis, very distant from the Axius, was separated

from the remainder by a part of Mygdonia; but as

this is improbable, the word is perhaps an error in

the text. The original inhabitants, the Mygdouians,

were a tribe belonging to the great Thracian race,

and were powerful enough to bequeath their name

to it, even after the Macedonian conquest. (Thuc.

ii. 90.) The cities of this district were Tiikssa-

LOXICA, SlNDTS, ClIALASTRA, AlTUS, StHKVSA,

* issrs. Mkllisuhgis, Hkraclkumtes. Besides  
these, the following obscure towns occur in Ptolemy

(/.<*.):—Chaetae, Moryllus, Antigoneia, Calindaea,

lioerus. P)iy-ca,Trepillus,Oarabia,Xylop«jlis, Assorus,

I-ete, I'hileros, As to the towns wliich occupied the

fertile plain between Mt. Cissus and the Axius, their

population was no doubt absorbed by Thessalonica, on

its foundation by Cassander, and remains of them are

not likely to be found; nor are the ancient references

sufficient to indicate their sites. One of these would

seem, from ancient inscriptions which were found at

Khutrdt, to have stood in that position, and others

probably occupied similar positions on the last falls

of the heights which extend nearly from Khnivtit

to the Axius. One in particular is indicated by

some large "tumuli11 or barrows, situated at two-

thirds of that distance, (Leake, Xorth. Greece,

vol. iii. p. 448.) [E. B. J.]

MVtiDO'NIA (MtrySoWo, Pint. Lucull. c. 32;

Polyb. v. 31), a district in the NE. part of Mesopo­

tamia, adjoining the country now called the Sinjnr.

According to Strabo, the people who were named

Mygdones came originally from Macedonia, and oc­

cupied the district extending from Zeugma to Tha-

psaeus (xvi. p. 747); as, however, he states in the

same place that Nit-ibis was called by the Mace­

donians " Antiocbcia in Mygdonia," and places it in

the immediate neighbourhood of M. Masius, he

would appear to have thought that it was on the

eastern side of Mesopotamia. Plutarch relates the

.same st>>ry of the Greek name of Ni.-ibis (LucuH.

c. 32). in Stcphnnus Byz. the name is written

Mux^octa, which is probably an error. In many

<■(' the earlier editions of Xenophun, a people are

BjKiken of who are called Mtiyonvioi; the later anil

better editions read, however, Ma/oorioi, winch is

mu.e probable (.l«u6. iv. 3. § 4). [V.J

MYGDO'XIUS (Mvytonos, Julian. 0raL?.V,\

the river which flows by the town of Nisibi* (now

Nixibin). It lakes its rise, together with tin- A'w-

l»tr and one or two other streams, in the 11 Masai

(now Knyja Bayhlar). Its present name i- :w

I/ermts or Nahr'al^Hwdi. [V.]

MYLAE (Mv\ai: Eth, MuAairTj*. Steph. B.: M*-

\a'to$, Diod.: Milazzo).* city on the N. coast of Sink,

about 30 miles from Cape Pclorus, and °.0ln>m Tyc-

daris, though Strabo calls it 25 miles from eaiii

I these points. (Strab. vi. p. 266.) It was eituild

on the narrow neck or i>thmus of a pnveetin:: pe-

! ninsiilar headland, about 5 miles in leneth, ;b*

■ furthest point of which is only about 15 mike fp^a

| the island of Hiera or Vulcano, the nearest t" Sicily

I of the htpari islands. Mylae was undoubtedly »

! Greek colony founded by the Zanclaeana, and apwaii

j to have long continued subject to, or dej**ndf-nt oft

its parent city of /.ancle. (Strub. vi. p. 272; Scnn.

Ch. 288.) Hence Tliueydides speaks of Himerau

in his time the only Greek city on the X. c-.-a.--t ot :iw

island, omitting Mylae, because it was not an iDde-

[icnJcnt city or stale. (Thuc. vi. G2.) The j*n>i

I of its foundation is wholly uncertain. Siefart oti

identify it witli the city called Cbersonesus l»y Eu*-

bin.-, the foundation of which that author as.-ijn»ioft

period as early as B.C. 716, but the identification ift

j very questionable. (Euseb. Chron. ad OL16L; Sicfcrt,

/.(inkh'-Mi[.tsfDi't, p. •!.) It is certain, howt^rr,

that it was founded before Himera. b. c. 648. a*,

according to Stnibo, the Xanclaeans at Mylae t*£

part in tlie colonisation of the latter city. (Strab. vv

p. 272.) Mylae itself does not appear to have erW

risen to any great importance; and after ibe revola-

tiou which changed the name of Xanele to that of

Messana, still continued in the same dependent re­

lation to it as before. It was, however, ft sirocfi

fortress, with a good port; and these advantage

which it derived from its natural situation, rendered

it a place of importance to the Mcssauians a» becvr

ii)L* their communications with the N. coast "t tin

island. Soy las speaks of it as a Greek city aa

port (Scyl. p, 4. § |:j), and its castle or fortress H

mentioned by several ancient writers. The earlied

historical notice of the city is found in b. G 427

when the Athenian Meet under Laches which wm

stationed at Khegium, made an attack upon Myla*

The place was defended by the Messaniana wittt I

strong garrison, but was compiled to surrender V

the Athenians and their allies, who therm^

marched against Messaua itself. (Time. in. 90.- ^

xii. 54.) After the destruction of Messana bv t_o

Carthaginian general Himilcon, Mylae apf«VB \
