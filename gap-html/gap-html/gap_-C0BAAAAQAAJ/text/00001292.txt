army li.nl occupied as a stronghold in it. c. 295 • but

notwithstanding the strength of tlte position, they

were attacked and defeated there by the Koman con-

mil L. Volnmnius Flamma (Liv. x. 30, 31). Upon

two other occasions during the Samnite wars Livy

speaks of Tifernus or Tifemuin in a manner that

would leave it uncertain whether this mountain fast­

ness is meant, or a town of the same name (Liv. ix.

44, x. 14); but as we have no other mention of a

town of Tifernum in Samnium, it is perhaps more

probable that in all these cases the mountain of that

name is meant. The group thus named is a part of

that known collectively as the Monte Matese,— one

of the most conspicuous mountain masses in Sam-

iiinm. [Samnium. ] The river Tifernus has ii course

of above 60 miles from its source to the Adriatic, in

a general direction from SVV. to NE. In the lower

part of its course, after leaving the confines of Sam­

nium, it constituted in ancient times the boundary

between Apulia and the Krentani. (Mel. ii. 4. § (J;

Plin. iii. U.S. 16, s. 17; PtoL iii. 1. §18,

where the MSS. have Qirtpvos; but this is pro­

bably a mistake for TltjMpvos.) [E. H. B.J

TIGAVA CASTRA {It. Ant. p. 38; Tigavae,

Plin. v. 2. r. I; Ttyava, Ptol, iv. 2. $ 26), a fortress

in Mauretania Caesarienais, between Oppidum Novum

and Malliana, variously identified with El-Herba,

Cantara, A bd—el-Kiuler.

TIGRA (called Tiya by Procopi-us, deAed.iv. 7),

a fortress in Moesia Inferior, near the Danube, and

between Sexantaprista and Appiaria (/tin. Ant. p.

222). In the Not hup. it is called Tegm. Va­

riously identified with Murotm and a place near

Olughmar. [T. H. D.J

pp. 522, 532; Ptol. v. 13. $ 22; i] TiyparoKtpra,

i'lut. J.iMXtlL 25. &c), literally, the city of Tigranes,

since Kfpra (»fcerf, gwdy or harta) meant, in the

AnneniHii dialect, city (Hesyeh. iii. p. 237). The

later capital of Armenia, built by Tigranes on an

eminence by the river Kicephoritis, a city of con­

siderable size and strongly fortified. It was in a

great measure populated with Greeks and Mace­

donians, taken thither by force from Cappadociu

and Cilicia. After Lucullos gained his victory over

Tigranes before its walls, he caused a great part of

the still unfinished town to be pulled down, and

permitted its kidnapped inhabitants to return to

their homes. Nevertheless, the town continued to

exist, though we hear but little of it subsequently

to this event. (Of, Strab. It. cc. and xii. p. 539, xvi.

lac. Ann. xii. 50, liv. 24, xv. 4; Plin. vi.

ruins of Sert on the C/tabur, with Mcjafurkin, and

with Amid or Amadiah. (Sec Aiusworth, ii. p.

361; St. Martin, i. p. 173; Kitter, Krdk. x. p. 87,

TIGRIS, a celebrated river of Asia. We find

various tonus of its name, both in Greek and Latin

writers. The earlier and more classical Greek form

is 6 Ti^pijs, gen. Ttypriroi (Herod, vi. 20; Xen.

A nab. iv. 1. § 3; Arr. A nab. vii. 7, &c), whilst the

form & Tiypts, gtn. T'typi5os, and sometimes Tiyptos,

is more usual among the later writers. (Strab. ii.

p. 79, xv. p. 728; Ptol. v. 13. § 7; Plut. LucidL 22,

&c.) Amongst the Romans the nom. is constantly

Tigris, with the gen. Tigris and arc. Tigrin and

Tigrim among the better writers (Virg. Eel. i. 63;

Lucan, iii. 261: Plin. vi. s. 9; Curt. iv. 5, &c);

but sometimes Tigridjs, Tigridcm (Lucau, iii. 256;

Eutrop. ix. IS; Anun. Mare. xxiiL 6. § 2n. k:)

According to Pliny, the river in the

its course, where it flowed gerr.lv, wu a

but lower down, where it moved with more spun,

it bore the name of Ti^is. which, in tin Uedai

language, signified an arrow (ct Strth.ii. p. SsJ;

Curt. iv. 9; Isid. Or. xii. c. 2, &c.) Jowpftv in

i. 1, 2. sq.) and Zonaras (An*, i. 2) merVL isj" r.

bore the name of Diglad; and in its eir!a*t ncji

it is still called Daahele, Dkbckk or /nniicAk

According to the general ttetiHioovaf thtttrtO

the Tigris rose in Armenia (Xen. Amak if. 1. $1
