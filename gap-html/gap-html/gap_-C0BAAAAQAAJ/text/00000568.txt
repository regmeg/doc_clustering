OMBRIOS.

of ffatfjar-tetsekh. The more m.icnificcnt of the

two stands upon the top of a sandy hill, and appears

to have been a species of Pantheon, since, according

to extant inscriptions, it was dedicated to Aroeres

(Apollo) and the other deities of the Ombite nome

by the soldiers quartered there. The smaller temple

to the N\V. was sacred to Isis. Both, indeed, are of

an imposing architecture, and still retain the bril­

liant colours with which their builders adorned

them. They are, however, of the Ptolemaic age,

with the exception of a doorway of sandstone, built

into a wall of brick. This was part of a temple

built by Thothmes III. in honour of the crocodile-

headed god Sevak. The monarch is represented on

the door-jambs, holding the measuring reed and

chisel, the emblems of construction, and in the act

of dedicating the temple. The Ptolemaic portions

of the larger temple present an exception to an

almost universal rule in Aecyptian architecture. It

has no propylon or dromos in front of it, and the

portico lias nn uneven number of columns, in all

fifteen, arranged in a triple row. Of these columns

thirteen are still erect. As there are two principal

entrances, the temple would seem to be two united

in one. strengthening the supposition that it was the

Pantheon of the Ombite nome. On a cornice above

the doorway of one of the adyta is a Greek inscrip­

tion, recording the erection, or perhaps the restora­

tion of the sekos by Ptolemy Philometor and his

sister-wife Cleopatra, u. c. ISO—145. The hill on

which the Ombite temples stand has been con­

siderably excavated at its base by the river, which

here strongly inclines to the Arabian bank.

The crocodile was held in especial honour by the

people of Oinbi; and in the adjacent catacombs are

occasionally found mummies of the sacred animal.

Juvenal, in his 15th satire, has given a lively de­

scription of a fight, of which he was an eye-witness,

between the Ombitae and the inhabitants of Ten-

tyra, who were hunters of the crocodile. On this

occasion the men of Oinbi had the worst of it; and

one of their number, having stumbled in his flight,

was caught and eaten by the Tentyrites. The sa­

tirist, however, has represented Oinbi as nearer to

Tcntyra than it actually is, these towns, in fact,

being nearly 100 miles from each other. The Hu­

man coins of the Ombite nome exhibit the crocodile

and the eftiiry of the crocodile-headed god Sev;ik.

The m<>dern hamlet of Koum-Ombos, or the hill

of Ombos, covers part of the site of the ancient

Oinbi, The ruins have excited the attention of

many distinguished modern travellers. Descriptions

of them will be found in the following works: —

OMBHIOS INS. [FoiiTt-NATAE Ins.]

OMliKO'XES ('0,u6>tvi>fj, Ptol. lii. 5. § 21), a

people of European Sarmatia, whose seat appears to

have been on the flanks of the Carpathians, about

the sources of the Vistula. Schafaiik (A'/ur. Alt.

vol. i. pp. 389—391, 407) considers them to be a

Celtic people, grounding his arguments mainly upon

the identity of their name with that of the Celtic

— as he considers them to be — Umbrians, or the

most ancient inhabitants of the Italian peninsula,

latent inquiry has thrown considerable douht upon

the derivation of the Umbrians from a Gaulish

stock. [Italia, Vol. II. p. 86, b.] Rusbmpvt
