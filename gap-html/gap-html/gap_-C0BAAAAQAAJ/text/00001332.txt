mentioned in history: and there is no other reason

for assuming the two places to be identical. (Clover.

Sicil. p. 3S8; Holsten. Xot, ad Steph. B. s. v.;

Wesselin*, ad Diod. I c.) [E. H. R.]

TYKALLIS (TupaAAis), a place in Cappadocia,

on the south-west of Cabassus, on the river Cydnua.

(Ptol. v. 7. § 7.) [L. S.]

TYRAMBAE (Tupa/xSai, Ptol. v. 9. § 17), a

people of Asiatic Sarmatia, whose chief city was

Tyrambe (Tupdfi§T]t ib. § 4, &c; Strab. xi. p. 494),

in the neighbourhood of the river Iihonibites Mi­

nor. [T. H. D.]

TYRANGl'TAE (Ti/payvftTcu, Topcry/erai, or

TvpcytTai, Stmb. vii. p. 2S9, &c; Ptol. iii. 5. § 25),

literally, the Getae of the Tyras, an immigrant

tribe of European Sarmatia dwelling E. of the river

Tyras, near the Ilarpii and Ta^ri, and, according to

Ptolemy, the northern neighbours of Lower Mocmu.

Pliny (v. 12. s. 26) calla them, with more correct

orthography, 'l'yra^etae, and represents them as

dwelling on a large island in the Tyras. [T. H. D.]

TYHAXNOBOAS (Tvpawu§6as), an emporium

on the western coast of Jiengal between Mandairara

and Byzantium, noticed by the author of the Peii-

plus (p. 30.) It cannot now be identified with any

place. [V.]

TYRAS (6 Tvpas, Stnib. ii. p. 107), one of the

principal rivers of Euroi«eun Sarmatia. According

to Herodotus (iv. 51) it rose in a large lake, whilst

Ptolemy (iii. 5. § 17, 8. § 1, &c.) places its sources

in Mount Carpates, and Strabo(/. c) says that they

are unknown. The account of Herodotus, however,

is correct, as it riot's in a lake in Gallicia. (Georgii,

AUe-Geogr. p. 269.) It ran in an easterly direc­

tion parallel with the later, and formed part of the

boundary between Dacia and Sarmatia. It fell into

the Pontus Euxinus to the NE. of the mouth of the

Ister; the distance between them being, according

to Strabo, 900 stadia (Strab. vii. p. 305, aeq.), and,

nctording to Pliny (iv. 12. s. 26), 130 miles (from

the Pseud oh toma). Scyinnus (/>. 51) describes it

;is of easy navigation, and abounding in fish. Ovid

(cr Pont. iv. 10. 50) speaks of its rapid course. At

a later period it obtained the name of Danastrts or

Dauastus (Amtn. Marc. xxxi. 3. § 3; Jornand. Get.

5; Const. Porphyr. de A dm. Imp. 8), whence its

modern name of Dniester (A'c^er), though the

Turks still call it Tnral (Cf. Herod, iv. 11,47, 82;

Scylax, p. 29; S;rab. i. p. 14; Mela, ii. l,&c; also

Schaffarik, Slav. Alterth. i. p. 505.) The form

Tvpis is sometimes found. (Steph, B. p. 671;

Suid. s. v. 'S.kvQcu and nouttSa^ios.) [T. H. D.]

TYRAS (Topai, Ptol. iii. 10. § 16), a town of

European Sarmatia, situated at the mouth of the

river just described. (Herod, iv. 51; Mela, ii. 1.)

It was originally a Milesian colony (Scymn. Fr, 5.i;

Anon. Peripl. P. Eux. p. 9); although Ammiaims

Marcellinus (xxii, 8. § 41), apparently from the

similarity of the name, which he writes "Tyros,"

ascribes its foundation to the Phoenicians from Tyre.

Pliny (iv. 12. s. 26; cf. Steph. B. p. 671) identifies

it with an older town named Ophiusa (*'gelidis pol-

lens Ophiusa vencnis," Val. Place, vi. 84). Ptolemy,

however {I.e.), makes them two different towns; and

places Ophiusa somewhat more N,, and towards the

interior. Scylax knows only Ophiusa, whilst the

later writers, on the other hand, knew only Tyras.

(Cf. Neumann, Die Hellenen im Slyihenlande,

p. 357, seq.) It probably lay on the site of the

present Ackermann. (Clarke, Travels, ii. p. 124;

Kohl, Ileisen in Sudrussland, i. 167.) [T. H. D.j
