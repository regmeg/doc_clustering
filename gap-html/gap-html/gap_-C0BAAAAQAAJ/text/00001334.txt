The wall is said to be covered with 2 or 3 fathoms

of water, whilst within it the depth is from 6 to 8

fathoms. Bertou admits, however, that this wall

has never been carefully examined; and if it had

existed in ancient times, it is impossible to con­

ceive how so stupendous a work should have escaped

the notice of all the writers of antiquity. Accord­
