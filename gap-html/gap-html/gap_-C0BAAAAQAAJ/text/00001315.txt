TRN/OALA (TpioimAa; Eth. Triocalinas: Ra.

i), a thy of Sicily, situated in

| the Interior of the island, about 12 miles from

I Thermae Selinnntiae (Sciocco). As the name is

cited by Stephanas of Byzantium (who writes the

name TphraAa) from Philistas, it is probable that

it was a Siculian town or fortress as early at least

as the time of the elder Dionysius; but no notice of

it is now found in history until the second Servile

War in Sicily in B. c. 103—100. On that occasion

Triucala was selected, on account of its great na­

tural strength and other advantages, by Tryphon,

the leader of the insurgents, as bis chief stronghold:

he fortified the rocky summit on which it was

situated, and was able to hold out there, as in an

impregnable fortress, after his defeat in the field by

L. Lucullus. (Diod. xxxvi. 7, 8.) The circum­

stances of its fall are not related to us, but Silius

llalicus aliudes to it as having suffered severely

from the effects of the war. (" Servili vastata

Triocala bello,*' xiv. 270). Cicero nowhere notices

the name among the municipal towns of Sicily, but

in one passage mentions the 44 Triocalinas ager"

(Kerr. v. 4); and the Triocalini again appear in

Pliny's fist of the municipal towns of Sicily. The

name is also found in Ptolemy, bat in a manner

that gires little information as to its position.

(Plin. iii. 8. s. 14; Ptol. iii. 4. § 14.) It was an

episcopal see during the early part of the middle

ages, and the site is identified by Fazello, who tells

us that the ruins of the city were still visible in his

time a short distance from CalatabeUoUa. a town of

Saracen origin, situated on a lofty hill about 12

miles inland from Sciacca; and an old church on

the site still preserved the ancient apprllation.

374). [E. H. B.]

TRICrTTUM (Toura-ior Sxpor: C. Crio), fhe pro-

montory at the eastern extremity of the peninsula

of Cnidus, forming at the same time the south­

western extremity of Asia Minor. (Thucyd. viii.

35,60; Scylax, p. 38; Pomp. Mela, i. 16.) On

the summit of this promontory a temple of Apollo,

hence called the Triopian, seems to hare stood, bear

which games were celebrated, whence Scylax calla

the promontory the da-pw-rtyMor wpoV. According

to some authorities the town of Cnidus itself also

bore the name of Triopium, having, it is said, been

fuunded by Triopas. (Steph. B. «. r. Tsiowmm.; Plin.

v. 29, who calls it Triopia; Eustatb. ad Horn. 1L

QuaeiL Grate, c. 17.) Strabo relates that, accord­

ing to some critics, Tripodi was mentioned by Ho­

mer, along with Aegirusa and Niaaea, as part of the

dominions of Ajax of Salamis, and that the Terse

containing these names wss omitted by the Athe­

nians, who substituted for it another to prove that

Salamis in the time of the Trojan War, belonged to

Athens. (Strab. 1 c.) Tripudiscus is celebrated

in the history of literature as the birthplsre of

Susarion, who is said to hare introduced comedy

into Attica, and to bare removed from this place

to the Attic Iraria. (Aspas. ad AriitoL Ktk. Afc.
