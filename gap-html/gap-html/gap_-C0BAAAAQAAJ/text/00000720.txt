6.34 riSCENAE. PIS'

Actium, r..c. 31. (Pint. Ant. GO.) It appears,

however, to liave been restored, and peopled with

fresh colonists by Augustus, for we find it bearing

in inscriptions the titles of " Colonia Julia Felix;"

an<l though Pliny does not give it the title of a

colony, its possession of that rank under the Empire

is abundantly proved by inscriptions. (E'lin. ii. 14.

r. 19; Orell. /nscr.81, 3143, 3098, 4069, 4084.)

From the same authority we learn that it was a

place of some trade, and that vessels were built

there, so that it had a " Collegium Fabrorum Na-

valinin."' (lb. 4084.) The pint was undoubtedly

formed by the mouth of the river, which .--till affords

a harbour tor small vessels. Its notation on the

great I'lamiuian Way also doubtless secured to

Pisaunun a certain share of prosperity as long as

the Roman empire continued; but it was always

interior to the neighbouring Fanuiu Fortunae. (Mel.

ii. 4. § 5; Ptol. ui. 1. § 22; Kin. Ant, pp. 100,

126; Itin, flier, p. 615; Tab. Pent.)

During the Gothic Wars Pisaurum was destroyed

by Vitiges, hut partially restored by Belisariui

(Procop. Ii. 0. iii. 11); and rose again to prosperity

under the exarchate of Bavenna, and became one of

the cities of the PentapolK (Geogr. Kav. iv. 31;

P. Diac Hut, Lang, ii. 19.) The modern city of

Pesaro is still a flourishing place; but ban no re­

mains of antiquity, except numerous inscriptions,

which have been collected and published with a

learned commentary by the Abate Olivieri. {Mar­

mora I'isawama, fol. Pisaur. 1738.) [E. II- B.]

PISCENAE, enumerated by Pliny (iii. 4. s. 5)

among the Oppida Latina of Gallia Xarbonensis. It

is generally assumed to be represented by Pezenas

in the district of Agatha (Affile) near the Anuria

(Iltrault). Pliny (viii. 48. s. 73) speaks of a wool

that was grown about Pisceuae, which was more like

hair than wool. [G. L ]

PISIDA, a municipium and station on the Ro­

man road running along the coast-line of Syrticu,

20 M. P. from Gypsaria Taberna (Ihihman), and

30 M. P. from Villa Magna(Kelah). {/(in. Anton.;

J't ut. Tab.} Ptolemy has a harbour, Pisindon

Portus (Tlurtv^uip A'mtjc, iv. 3. § 12), on the coast,

which is represented by the harbour of Bartkd or

Brtga. (Barth, \Vaudcrungtnt p. 271.) [E. B. J.]

PISIDIA (v Tliffi&urf): Elk. flifftfai, l'isidae), a

province in the south of Asia Minor, which was in

the earlier limes always regarded as a part of Pliry­

gia »>r Pamphylia, but was constituted a separate

province in the division of the Roman empire made

by Constantino the Great. It bordered in the east

on Isauria and Cilicia, in the south on Pamphylia,

in the west on Lycia, Caria, and Plirygia, and in

the nortli on Plirygia Parorios; but it is almost

iui]KM*sible to mark the exact boundary lines, csj>e-

ci illy in the north and north-west, as the northern

parts of Pisidia are often treated as parts of Pliry­

gia, to which they originally belonged, and from which

they are sometimes called Plirygia Pisidica, or 4vu-

yta *phs iWiSiW; but Amyntas separated them

from Plirygia and united them witli Pisidia. (Strab.

xii. p. 570, &c; PtoL v. 5. 4, 8; Dionys. Per.

858, &c; Plin. v. 24; Hierocl. pp. 662. &<\, 679,

&c.) The country, which was rough and moun­

tainous, though it contained several fertile valleys

and plains, which admitted of the cultivation of

olives (Strab. I.e.), was divided into several dis­

tricts, with separate names. The south-western

district bordering on Lycia was called Milyas, and

another adjoining it bo
