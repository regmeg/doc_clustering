TEXEDOS (TtM«o»: ft*. To^Scm), a fortified

ntst-town in the west of Pamphylia, 20 stadia to

* west nf Attalia. (Stepli. B. «. v.; Stadium,  
tar. 3f. §§ 224, 225.) It has been conjectured

>al this town is the same as Olbia, the remains of

luck are exactly 20 stadia from Attalia, and that

v of the two names was I.ycian and the other

iwk. (Muller, ad Stadium', p. 490.) [L. S.]

Mrroe- Tenesis was governed, at least when

nlo wrote, by a queen, who was also the sovereign

Urns. This was one of the many districts of

rthiopia assigned by rumour to the Automoli,

Tibntae. or Acgyptian war-caste, who abandoned

»ir native country in the reign of Psammetichus

ufOKiTAE]. The lake Coloe and the sources of

- Astapus are by some geographers placed in  
n«ets. It was an alluvial plain bounded on the

by tbe Abyssinian Highlands, and frequented by

'phanta. rhinoceroses. Ac. [\V. B. I).]

TENOS (Tqrar: Etk. Tt/»ioi: Tiiiu), an island

the Aegaean sea, and one of the Cycladcs, lying

!w«m Aodrus and Debs, distant from the former

mile and from the latter 15 miles. (Plin. nr. 12.

W.) It stretches from NW to SE., and is 15

le» long according to Pliny (/. c ). or 150 stadia

-rding to Scylax (p. 55). It was also called

.ru^.sa ('Topowrffo, 'T&fn*<rira) from the number

lU springs, and Ophinssa because it abounded in

dtea. (Plin. I c.; Mela, ii. 7. § 11; Stepli. B.

r ) The sons of Boreas are s.iid to have been

■r. in this Island by Hercules. (Apoll. KhoJ.

.VM, with Schol.) In the invasion of Greece by

rxrt, the Tenians were compelled to serve in the

>uui fleet; but a Tenian trireme deserted to

(■reeks immediately before the battle of Sa­

tis (at. c 480). and accordingly the name of the

.»ris waa inscribed upon the tripod at Delphi in

I-a*, of Grecian statea which had overthrown the

sxana. (Herod, viii. 82.) Pausanias relates

t The name of the Tenians was also inscribed on

ftaxov of Zeus at Olympta among the Greeks who

Aught at the battle of Plataea (v. 23. § 2).

Tenians afterwards formed part of the Athenian

•:nie empire, and are mentioned among the sub-

allies of Athens at the time of the Sicilian ex-

tiax (Thuc. rii. 57). They paid a yearly

. l# of 3600 drachmae, from which it may be

«-d that they enjoyed a considerable share of

pmtw. (Franx, Elcm. Epigr. Or. No, 49.)

uader uf Pberae took possession of Tenos for a

time (Dem. c rulycL p. 1207); and the island

was afterwards granted by M. Anlonius to the

Khodians (Appian, B. C. v. 7.) After the con­

quest of Constairtinnple by the Latins, Tenos fell to

the share, of the Venetians, and remained in their

hands long after their other possessions in the

Aegaean had been taken by the Turks. It was

ceiled by Venice to the Sultan by the peace of Pas-

sarovitz, 1718. It is still one of the most pros­

perous islands in the Aegaean, and the inhabitants

are remarkable for thoir industry and good conduct.

The present population is about 15,000 souls, of

whom more than half are Catholics, — a circum­

stance which, by bringing thein into closer con­

nection with western Europe, has contributed to

their pnepcrity.

The ancient city of Tenia, of the. same name as

the island, stood at the south-western end upon the

same site as Si. Aico&ios, the present capital. Scy­

lax says that it possessed a harbour, and Strabo

describes it as a small town. (Scyl. p. 22; Strab.

x. p. 487 ; Ptol. iii. 14. § 30.) In the neighbour­

hood of the city tltere was a celebrated temple of

Poseidon situated in a grove, where festivals were

celebrated, which were much frequented by all the

neighbouring people. (Strab. I. c.; Tac Ann. iii.

63; Clem, fro/r. p. 18; Biickh, Itucr. No. 2329.

2331.) The attributes of Poseidon appear on the

coins of Tenos. There was another town in the

island named Eriston ^Hpurrov; Bockh, Jtucr.

2336, 2337), which was situated in the interior

at the village of Komi. Among the curiosities

of Tenos was mentioned a fountain, the water ot

which would not mix with wine. (Athen. ii. p.

43, c.) The island was celebrated in antiquity

for its fine garlic (Aristoph. 1'ltiL 18.) The

chief modern production of the island is wine,

of which the best kind is the celebrated Malvasia,

which now grows only at Tenos and no loncer ut

M<membatia in Peloponnesus, from which place it

derived its name. (Tournefort, Voyage, tfc. vol. i.

the western hank of the Xile, about 38 miles N. of

Thebes. The name of the city was probably de­

rived from the princijul object of worship there —

the goddess Athor (Aphrodite), being a contracted

form of Thy-n-Athor or alxsle of Athor. The hie-
