Of the other four paten, the Homoloides is also

the same in all the rive writers. Of the remaining

three Aeschylus does nut mention their proper

names, hut (specifies two by their locality, one as

near the temple of Athena Onca, and the other as

the Northern pate (Bop^cnai ttoAoi), and describes

the last simply as the Seventh pate. The names

of these three pates are nearly the same in tiie other

four writers, the one near the temple of Athena

Onca being called Crenaeae, and in Statins Culmina

Dircaea, the Northern eate Ogygiae, and the Seventh

pate Hypsistae,— Euripides, however, also giving the

name of Seventh to the last •mentioned pate.

Having described the position of the Electrae,

Proetides, and Neitae, it remains to speak of the

position of the oilier four, which we shall take in

the order of Aeschylus. The fourth gate was pro­

bably situated on the western side uf the city, and

was called Crenaeae, because it was near one of the

fountains of Dirce, now called Tlapair6pri, situated

upon the right bank of the river. Near that foun­

tain was a hill, called by the Greeks uynos, whence

Athena derived the name of Onca. Accordingly

Statins, in calling the fourth pate Culmina Dir­

caea, connects both the fountain and the hill. Non-

nus, who calls this pate Oncaea, describes it at the

Rime time as situated towards the west. It is

usually stated, on the authority of Hesychius, that

the Oncaean pate is tlie same as the Ogygian; but

this identification throws everything into confusion,

while the change of three letters, proposed by Forch-

harnmer, brings the statement of H^ytl i» -*

accordance with the other writers. (*07cai Ar--*
