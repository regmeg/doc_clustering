606 PHOENICIA. PHOENICIA.

tli:tt he makes the river Eleutherus the X. boun­

dary, and does not mention Aradus, which lay a

little to the N. of that stream. There can be no

question, however, that Aradus belonged to Phoe­

nicia, So, too, at the southern extremity, the town

of Dora was unquestionably Phoenician, whilst

Cuesarea, the first town S. of the Chorseus, be­

longed to Palestine.

Phoenicia, as thus defined, lies between lat. 32°

38' and 34° 52' N., and long. 35—36° E. It forms

a narrow slip of land about 120 miles in length,

and seldom more, but frequently less, than 12 miles

broad. The range of Libanus, which skirts the

greater part ot" its eastern side, throws out spurs

which form promontories on the coast, the most

remarkable of which are Theu-prueopon (&c<jv-

Ttpoooiifov} between the towns of Trieris and Botrys,

and the Promontorium Album between Tyre and

Fcdippa. Further to the S. Mount Carmel forms

another bold promontory. The whole of Phoenicia

presents a succession of hills and valleys, and is

traversed by numerous small rivers which descend

from the mountains and render it well watered and

fruitful. The coast-line trends in a south-westerly

direction; so that whilst its northern extremity lies

nearly under long. 36°, its southern one is about

under 35°. Aradus, its most northerly town, lies

on an island of the same name, between 2 and 3

in les from the mainland, and nearly opposite to the

southern extremity of Mount ISargvlus, On the

coast over against it lay An 1 aradus. From this

jjoint t<* Tripolis the coast forms an extensive bay,

into which several rivers fall, the principal being the

Eleutherus (Nakr-el-Kcbtr), which Hows through

the valley between Mount Bargylus and Libanus,

To the N, of the Eleutherus lie the towns of Si my ra

and Marathus; to the S. the principal town before

arriving at Tripolis was Orthosia, close to the sea­

shore. Tripolis stands on a promontory about half

a mile broad, and running a mile into the sea. It

is washed by a little river now called El-Kadtsha,

"the holy." Tripolis derived its name from being

the federal town of the three leading Phoenician

cities. Tyre, Sidon, and Aradus, each of which hail

hen: its separate quarter. To the S. of Tripolis the

country ii>es into chalk hills, which press so closely

tin the sea as to leave no room for cultivation, ami

scarcely even for a road, and which form the bold

promontory already mentioned of Theupro.vnpon.

(Rtij-(,i-$fitknh.) The chief towns of this district

are Calamos and Trieris. To the S. of Theu-

prosopon the hills recede a little from the sea, but

at a distance of between 20 and 30 miles form

another lofty promontory called Climax (Jias Wnlta

Sillan), from the circumstance that the steepness

of the cliH's rendered it necessary to cut stejw in

them. Along this tract several rivers descend into

the sea, the principal of which is the Adonis (A'aAr-

tt-Ibrahim). The chief towns are Botrys, 7 miles

S. of l heuprosopon, and Byblus, a little S. of the

Adonis. Palai-byblus lay still further S., but its site

].-, unknown. Aphaca, noted for its licentious wor­

ship of Venus, was seated in the interior, at the

source of the river Adonis in Lihanus. The pro­

montory of Climax formed the N. point of the bay,

now called Kcsruan, the S. extremity of which, at

a distance of about 12 miles, is formed by the head­

land lias-en-Nahr-el-Kelb, on which the town of

Berytus formerly stood. At about the middle of

this bay the river Lycus (Xiihr-el-Kelb) din barges

itself into the sea through a narrow chasm the

the Lycus rises the <JrM eJ-.Scmw, \ht Li_!r£
