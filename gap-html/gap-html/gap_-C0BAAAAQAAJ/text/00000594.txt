thian column (Demon, lEgr/pte, pi. 31),. without

leaves or volutes, partly buried in the sand, indicates

a structure of a later period, probably of the age of'

Diocletian. Oxyrynchus became the site of an epis­

copal see, and Apollonius dated from thence an

epistle to the Council of Seleueeia (Epiphan. Haeret.

in the ape of Hadrian and Antoninus Pius. (1.) Ha-

the Saea aera. (Lassen, r/e Pentap. p. 57; Bohlen,

OZOGARDANA, a town in the middle of Meso­

the advance of Julianus through that country (xxiv.

C. 2). He states that the inhabitants preserve

there a throne or seat of judgment which they say

belonged to Trajan. The same story, is told in al­

most the same words by Zosimus of a place lie calls

Zaragardia (iii. 15). The place cannot now with

certainty be identified; but Mannert thinks it the

same as shortly afterwards bore the name of Pa-
