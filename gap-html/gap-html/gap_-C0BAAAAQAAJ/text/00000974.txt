modern Orvieto, the name of which is evidently a

corruption of Urba Veins, the form used by Paulus

Diaconua in the .seventh century (p. Diac. iv. 33):

tliere is, therefore, little doubt that the site was one

of a more ancient Etruscan city; and its proximity

to Volsinii renders it probable enough that it may

have been Salpinum. But no reliance can be placed

upon any such conclusion. (Niebuhr, vol. ii. p.

493.) [E. H. B.]

SALSAS or SALSA, a river of Cannania, noticed

by Plinj (vi. 25). Reichard imagines tliat this is

the same stream as that called by Mart/ian,Cathraps

(p. 21, ed. Hudson), and by Ptolemy, Araps or

Cathraps (vi. 8. § 4); and he identifies it with the

modern Shur; but this seems very doubtful. [V.]

SALSULAE. in Gallia. Mela (ii. 5) describes

the Salsulae Eons as nut sending forth fresh water,

but water filter than the sea. He places the Eons

south of the lake Kubresus, and near the shore

which he calls Leueate [Lkucatk]. Salsulae is

in the Aotonine I tin. on the road from Narbo to the

Pyrenees. Salsulae is SaUcs or Salves, where there

is a salt-spring. Near the Eons, says Mela, is a

plain very yreen with tine and slender reeds, under

which is water. This is the place, he Bays, where

fish are pot by striking down with a pronp or some­

thing of the sort; and this is the origin of the fables

told by the Greeks and some Rot nam about fishes

bein-* dag out of the ground. He alludes to Po-

lybius (xxxiv. 10). [Ruscoto.] [G. L.]

SALVA (SoAot'd), a town in the north-eastern

extremity of Lower Pannoniat on the ri^ht bank of

the Danube. (Ptol.il. 16. § 4; Itm. Ant pp. 266,

267.) According to the Notitia Imperii, w here it

is called Solva, it contained a garrison of a body of

hor.->enien. The site of this place cannot be ascer­

tained with certainty. [L. S.J

SA'LYES (2a,\ues), SA'LYI, SALLU'VII, or

SA'LLYKS (Staph. Byz. s. v.), a Lignrian people in

Gallia. There are other varieties in the writing of

the word. The early Greeks cave the name of

Ligyes to these Salves; and their territory, which

was in the possession of the Massaliots, when Strabo

wrote, was originally called Ligystice. (Strab. iv.

p. 203.) The geographer means to say that the

old Greeks were not acquainted with the name of

Salyes. but only with the name of the nation to

which they belonged. Livy (v. 34) speaks of the

Phocaeans who founded Massilia being attacked by

the Salyes, for in bis tune the name Salyes was fa­

miliar tu the Romans.

Strabo speaks of the Salyes in his oncriftist 4

the Alps. He makes their country extend bm

Antipolis to Massilia, and even a little fortkr.

They occupied the hilly country which lia nasi

and some parts of the coast, where they wo* lucfiat

with the Greeks (iv. p. 203). They exteodadwat

as far as the Rhone. The Salyes had iLa

country north of Massilia as far as the Draeaii

(Duruttce), a distance of 500 stadia; \n\ eo ctae-
