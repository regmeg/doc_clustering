§ I). or of riastu, a Pelasgiun prince. (Strab. xiv.

H*i.)

I. An important town of Thessaly, the capital of

the district Pelasgiotis, was situated in a fertile

pUin npon a gently rising ground, ou the right or

K>uth bank of the Peneius. It had a strongly forti­

fied citadeL (Diod. xv. 61.) Larissa is not men­

tioned by Homer. Some commentators, however,

suppose it to be the same as the Pelasgic Argos of

Homer (11 ii. 681), but the latter was the name of

a district rather than of a town. Others, with more

probability, identify it with the Argissa of the poet.

(fL il 73>.) [See Vol. I. p. 209.] Its foundation

wasa-vcribed to Acrisiu.". (Steph. B..«. r.) The plain

of I . i- 'i was formerly inhabited by the Perrhaebi,

wbo were partly expelled by the Larissacans, and

fartly reduced to subjection. They continued sub­

ject to Larissa, till Philip made himself master of

ThesBaly. (Strab. be. p. 440.) The constitution of

Larissa was democrat teal (Aristot. Pol. v. 6), and

tins was probably one reason why the Larissaeans

were allies of the Athenians during the Pelopon-

wsian War. (Thuc. ii. 22.) During the Roman

wars in Greece, Larissa is frequently mentioned as a

place of importance. It was here that Philip, the

Ml of Demetrius, kept all his royal papers during

bUcampaign against Flamininus in Greece; but after

the battle of Cynoscephalae, in b. c. 197, he was

obliged to abandon Larissa to the Romans, having

f*t-Tioo>ly destroyed these documents. (Polyb. xviii.

16.) It was still in the hands of the Romans when

Amiochus crossed over into Greece, b. c. 191, and

tiiu king made an ineffectual attempt upon the town.

(Ut. xxxvi. 10.) In the time of Strabo Larissa

continued to be a flourishing town (ix. p. 430). It

is mentioned by Hierocles in the sixth century as the

first town in Thessaly (p. 642, ed. Wessel.). It is

ttitl a considerable place, the residence of an arch-

tn*J>op and a pa&ha, and containing 30,000 inhabit­

ant*. It continues to bear its ancient name, though

the Turks call it Ytnisheher, which is its official

appellation. Its circumference is less than three

nuWi. Like other towns in Greece, which have been

continually inhabited, it presents few remains of Hel­

lenic times. They are chiefly found in the Turkish

cemeteries, consisting of plain quadrangular stones,

fragments of columns, mostly fluted, and a great

number of ancient cippi and sepulchral stelae, which

now ierre for Turkish tombstones. (Leake, North­

ern Grtectj toL L p. 439, seq.)

stown of Thessaly of less importance than the pre­

ceding Qnel was situated in the district of Phthiotis,

tt the distance of 20 stadia from the Maliac gulf,

"p^n & height advancing in front of Mount Othrys.

(Stab. U. p. 435.) It occupied the side of the hill,

■ad wu hence sumamed Cremaste, as hanging on

the tide of Mt. Othrys, to distinguish it from the

more celebrated Larissa, situated in a plain. Strabo

also describes it as well watered and producing vines

(ix. p. 440). The same writer adds that it was sur-

named Pelasgia as well as Cremaste (I. c). From

its being situated in the dominions of Achilles, some

writers suppose that the Roman poets give this hero

the surname of Lurissaeus, but this epithet is per-

haps used generally for Thessalian. Larissa Cre­

maste was occupied by Demetrius Poliorcetes in b. c.

302, when he was at war with Cassander. (Diod. xx.

110.) It was taken by Apustius in the first war

between the Romans and Philip, b c. 200 (Liv.

xxxi. 46), and again fell into the hands of the Ro­

mans in the war with Perseus, b. c. 171. (Liv. xlii.

56, 57.) The ruins of the ancient city are situated

upon a steep hill, in the valley of Gurdhiki, at a di­

rect distance of five or six miles from Khanniko.

The walls are very conspicuous on the western side

of the hill, where several courses of masonry remain.

Gell says that there arc the fragments of a Duric

temple upon the acropolis, but of these Leake makes

no mention. (Gell, Itinerary of Greece, p. 252;

Dodwell, Travels, vol. ii. p. 81; Leake, Northern

Greece, vol. iv. p. 347.)

LARISSA (Aapieraa). 1. A town in the territory

of Ephesus, on the north bank of the Caystrus,

which there flows through a most fertile district,

producing an excellent kind of wine. It was situated

at a distance of 180 stadia from Ephesus, and 30

from Tralles. (Strab. ix. p. 440, xiii. p. 620.) In

Strabo's time it had sunk to the rank of a village,

but it was said once to have been a tt6\i$, with a

temple of Apollo. Cramer (As. Mm. i. p. 558)

conjectures that its site may correspond to the

modern Ttrieh.

2. A place on the coast of Troas, about 70 stadia

south of Alexandria Troas, and north of Hamaxitus.

It was supposed that this Larissa was the one men­

tioned by Homer (II. ii. 841), but Strabo (xiii.

p. 620) controverts this opinion, because it is not

far enough from Troy. (Comp. Steph. B. s. v.)

The town is mentioned as still existing by Thu

cydides (viii. 101) and Xenophon (Ilellen. iii 1.

§ 13; comp. Scylax, p. 36; Strab. ix. p. 440,

xiii. p. 604). AUienaeus (ii. p. 43) mentions some

hot springs near Larissa in Troas, which are still

known to exist a little above the site of Alexandria

Troas. ( Voyage I'ittoresque, vol. ii. p. 438.)

3. Larissa, surnamed Phkiconis, a Pelasgiur

town in Aeolis, but subsequently taken possession

of by the Aeolians, who constituted it one of the

towns of their confederacy. It was situated near

the coast, about 70 stadia to the south-east of

Cyme (h wepl rfyv Kvpijv, Strab. xiii. p. 621;

Herod. I, 149). Strabo, apparently for good reasons,

considers this to be the Larissa mentioned in the

Iliad (ii. 840). Xenophon (Ilellen. iii. 1. § 7,

comp. Cyrop. vii. 1. § 45) distinguishes this town

from others of the same name by the epithet of

"the Egyptian," because the elder Cyrus had esta­

blished there a colony of Egyptian soldiers. From

the same historian we must infer that Larissa was

a place of considerable strength, as it was besieged

in vain by Th'nnhrom; but in Strabo's time the

place was deserted. (Comp. Plin. v. 32; Veil. Pat.

i. 4; Vit. Horn. c. 11; Steph. B. s. v.; Ptol. v. 2.
