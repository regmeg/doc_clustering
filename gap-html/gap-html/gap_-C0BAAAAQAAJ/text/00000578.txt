O'RKUS {'CLpt6$: Kth. 'flptmfj: the territory

'*Va, Strab. x. p. 445), formerly called HISTIAEA

('loTi'aia, also 'Eariaia: Eth. 'lariauv?). a town in

the north of Euboea, situated upon the river C.iMas,

at the foot of Mt, Telethrium, and opposite Antron

en the Thessalian coast. From this town the whole

northern extremity of Euboea was named Histiaeotis

('l<TTiaiwTi$, Ion. 'liTTtaniTis, lleiud. vii. 23). Ac­

cording to .some it was a colony from the Attic

demus of Histiaea (Strab. x. p. 445); according to

others it was founded by the Thes-sahan Perrhaebi.

(Scyinn. Ch. 578.) It was one of the most ancient

and most important of the Euboean cities. It oc­

curs in Homer, who gives it the epithet uf tto\v-

trratpuAos (//. ii. 5.'J7); and ScylaX mentions it as

one of the four cities of Euboea (p. 22). After the

battle of ArtemUium, when the Grecian fleet sailed

southwards, Histiaea was occupied by the Persians.

(Herod, vii. 23.) Upon the expulsion of the Per­

sians from Greece, Histiaea, with the other Kuboean

towns, became subject to Attica. In the revolt of

Euboea from Athens in B.C. 445, we may conclude

that Histiaea took a prominent part, since Pericles,

upon the reduction of the island, exj«*lled the inha­

bitants from the city, and peopled it with 2001)

Athenian colonists. The expelled Hi.stiaeans were

said by Theopotnpos to have withdrawn to Mace­

donia. (Thuc. i. 114: Diod. xii. 7, 22; Plut. Per.

23; TheojM.mp. ap. Strab. x. p. 445.) From this

time we find the name of the town changed to

Oreus, which was originally a demus dependent upon

Histiaea. (Strab. I. c; Pans, vii. 26. § 4.) It is

true tiiat Thueydides upon one occasion subseipi-'ntly

calls the town by its ancient name (vii. 57); but he

speaks of it as Oreus, in relating the .second revolt

of Euboea in B.C. 411, where he says that it was

the only town in the island that remained faithful to

Athens. (Thuc. viii. 95.) At the end of the Pelo-

ponnesian War, Oreus became subject to Sparta;

the Athenian colonists were doubtless expelled, and

a portion at least of its ancient inhabitants restored;

and accordingly we read that this town remained

faithful to Sparta and cherished a lasting hatred

against Athens. (Diod. xv. 30.) Neogcnes, sup-

|>orted by Jason of Pherac, made himself tyrant of

Oreus for a time; but he was expelled by Therip-

pidas, the Lacedaemonian commander; and the

Athenian Chabrias endeavoured in vain to obtain

possession of the town. (Diod. /. <?.) But short I v

afterwards, before the battle of Leuctra, Oreus re­

volted from Sparta. (Xen. Hell v. 4. § 5G.) Iu

the subsequent war between Philip and the Athe­

nians, a party in Oreus was friendly to Philip; and

by the aid of this monarch Philistides became tyrant

of the city (Dem. Phil, hi. pp. 119, 127, de Cor.

p. 248; Strab. /. c); but the Athenians, at the in­

stigation of Demosthenes, sent an expedition against

Oreus, which expelled Philistides, and, according to

Cnarax, put him to death. (Dem. oV; Cor. p. 252:

Charax, ap. Stepk. g. v. 'Clptos.) In consequence of

its geographical position and its fortifications, Oreus

became an important place in the subsequent wars, j

In the contest between Antigonus and Cassander it

was besieged by the latter, who was, however, obliged

to retire upon the approach of Ptolemj, the general

of Antigonus. (Diod. xix. 75, 77.) In the first

war between the Koinans and Philip, it was betrayed

to the former by the commander of the Macedonian

garrison, u. c. 207. (Lhr. xxviii. G.) Iu the

^■cond war it was taken by the Romans by assault,

u.c. 200. (Liv. xxxi. 46.) Soon afterwards, in

B. c. 190, it was declared free by T. Q'linrthsiV

minimis along with the other Grecian Mtta (Njk

xviii. 2S, 30; Liv. xxxiii. 31, 34.) Pfaj moMi
