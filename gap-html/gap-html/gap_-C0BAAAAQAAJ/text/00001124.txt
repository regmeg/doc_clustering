and all that ho could learn respecting it w.is, that

Hera was formerly worshipped there in three dif­

ferent sanctuaries, as virgin, wife, and widow The

modern city lay upon the southern edge of the lake,

about a mile and a half from the katuvothra, and

upon a rocky promontory connected with the moun­

tains behind. Stymphalus is mentioned by Homer

(//. ii. 608), and also by Pindar (Ol. vi. 1G9), who

calls it the mother of Arcadia. Its name does not

often occur in history, and it ow es its chief importance

to its being situated upon one of the most frequented

routes leading to the westward from Argolis and

Corinth. It was takeu by Apollonides, a general of

Cassander (Diod. xix. 63), and subsequently be­

longed to the Achaean League (Polyb. ii. 55, iv. 68,

&c). In the time of Pausanias it was included in

Argolis (viii. 22. § 1)« T lie only building of the

city, mentioned by Pausanias, was a temple of Arte-

mis Styinphalia, under the roof of which were figures

of the birds Stymphalidcs; while behind the temple

btood statues of white marble, representing young

women with the legs and thighs of birds. These

birds, so celebrated in mythology, the destruction of

w hich was one of the labours of Heracles (Diet, of

liiagr. Vol. II. p. 3(JG), are said by Pausanias to be

as large as cranes, but resembling in form the ibis,

only that they have stronger beaks, and not crooked

like those of the ibis (viii. 22. § 5). On some of

the coins of Stymphalus, they are represented ex­

actly in accordance with the description of Pau­

sanias.

The territory of Stymphalus is now called the vale

of ZaraJcd, from a village of this name, abour a mile

from the eastern extremity of the lake. The re­

mains of the city u^n the projecting cape already

mentioned are more important than the cursory

notice of Pausanias would lead one to expect They

cover the promontory, and extend as far as the

fountain, which was included in the city. On the

steepest part, which appeals from below like a sepa­

rate hill, are the ruins of the polygonal walls of a

small quadrangular citadel. The circuit of the city

walls, with their round towers, may be traced. To

the east, beneath the acropolis, are the foundations

of a temple in antU ; but the most important ruins

are those on the southern side of the hill, where are

numerous remains of buildings cut out of the rock.

About ten minutes X. of Stymphalus, are the ruins

of the medieval town of Kronia (Leake, Morea,

vol. iii. p. 108, seq.; Peloponnesiaca, p. 384; Bob I aye,

Recherches, <fc\, p. 384 ; Koss, Reisen im Peh-

STYRA (t&StiVo: Kth. %Tvpevt; Stura), a town

of Euboea, on the W. coast, X. of Carystus, and nearly

opposite the promontory of Cynosura iu Attica. The

town stood near the shore in the inner part of the

bay, in the middle of winch is the island Aegileia,

now called Sturan'tsi. Styra is mentioned by Homer

along with Carystus (//. ii. 530). Its inhabitants

were originally Dryopians, though they denied this

origin (Herod, viii. 46; Paus. iv. 34. § 11), and

claimed to be descended from the demu.i of Steiria

in Attica. (Strab. x. p. 446 ) In the First Persian

War (b. c. 490) the Persians landed at Aegileia,

winch belonged to Styra, the prisoners whom they

had taken at Eretrifl. (Herod, vi. 107.) In the

Second Persian War (b. c. 480, 479) the StyrUns

fmghtat Artemisium, Salamis, and Plataeae. They

s-Mit two ships to the naval engagements, and at

Plataeae they and the Erctrians amounted together

to 600 men. (Herod, viii. 1,46,11.28: Ptas v.

23. § 2.) They afterwards hecairt* lb* aVws* sf
