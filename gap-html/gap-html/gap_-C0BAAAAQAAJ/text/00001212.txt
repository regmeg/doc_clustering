1126 TENEBRIUM. TEXEDOS.

Tenea, Slephanns describes Tenea as lying between 1

Cnriiuli nnd Mycenae. (.*. t\ To'e'a.) The Teneatae

claimed descent from the inhabitants of Tenedos,

who were brought over from Troy as prisoners, and

settled by Agamemnon in this part of the Corinthia; i

and they said tiiat it was in consequence of llieir

Trojan origin that they worshipped Apollo above all

the other pods. (Pans. ii. 5. § 4.) Strabo also i

mentions here the temple of Apollo Tcneat.es, and j

says that, Tenea and Tenedos had a common origin

in Tennus, the son of Cyeims. (Strab. viii. p. 330.)

According to Dionysius, however, Tenea was of lute

foundation, (Cic. ad Ate. vi. 2. § 3.) It was at |

Tenen that Oedipus was said to have passed his

childhood. It was also from this place that Archias

tm.k the greater number of tlie colonists with whom

he founded Syracuse. After the destruction of

Corinth by Mummius, Tenea had the good fortune

11> coul inue undisturbed, because it is said to have as­

sisted the Romans against Corinth. (Strab. I. c.) We

cannot, however, suppose that an insignificant place

like Tenea could have acted in opposition to Corinth

and the Achaean League; and it is more probable 1

thai the Teneatae were spared by Mummius in conse­

quence of their pretended Trojan descent and conse­

quent affinity with the Romans themselves. However

this may be, their good fortune gave rise to the line:

Tenea lay in Hie mountain valley through which

flows the river that falls into the Corinthian gulf to

the east of Corinth. In this valley are three places

at which vases and other antiquities have been dis­

covered, namely, at the two villages of Chilimodi

and Klenta, both on the road to Xauplia, and the

latler at the very foot of the ancient road ContO]X)ria

[see Vol. I. p. 201, b.], and at the village of Athiki.

an lumr east of ChUimodi, on the read to Sophiko.

In the holds of Athiki there was found an ancient

statue of Apollo, a striking confirmation of the pre­

valence of the worship of this god in the district. The

Teneatae would therefore appear to have dwelt in

scattered abodes at these three spots and in the in­

tervening country; hut the village of Tenea, properly

so called, was probably at Chilimodi, since the dis­

tance from this place to Corinth corresj»onds to the

60 stadia of I'ansanias.

Since one of the passes from the Argeia into the

Corinthia runs by KUnia and Chilimodi, there can

lie little doubt that it was by this road that Agesi-

laus marched from the Argeia toCorinth in B.C. 391.

(Xen. Hell. iv. o. § 19.) In the text of Xenophon

the words are eVe^te vw*p€a\u>v Kara Teyeav is

KtipivBov, but TWai/ ought to be substituted for

Teyf'ar. since it is impossible to believe that Age-

silans could have marched from the Argeia to

Corinth by way of'Tegea. Moreover, we learn from

Strabo (viii. p. 380) that the well-known name of

Tegea was in other cases substituted for that of

Tenea. In the parallel passage of the AgetiLxvx of

Xenophon (ii. 17), the pass by Tenea is called

h-uTa tit fl-T€t'a. (Leake, Aforea, vol. iii. p. 320,
