9 Ji SCYROS. SCYTHIA.

tion Scyros was conquered by Achilles (Hum. 77.

i. 60S; Paus. i. 22. § 6); and this conquest was

connected in the Attic legends with the death of

Theseus. After Theseus had been driven out of

Athens he retired to Scyros, where he was first

hospitably received by Lycomedes, but was after­

wards treacherously hurled into the sea from one

of the rocks in the island. It was to revenue his

death that Peleus sent Achilles to conquer the

island. (Plut. Thes. 35; Paus. i. 22. § 6; Philostr.

Heroic. 19 ) Scyros is said to have been originally

inhabited by Pelasgians, Carinas, and Dolopians;

and we know from Thucydides that the island was

stiil inhabited by Dolopians, when it was conquered

byCimon after the Persian wars. (Kicolaus Damasc,

ap. Steph. B. s. v.; Scyinn. Cb. 5S0, seq.; Thac. i.

93; Diod. xi. 60.) In b. c. 476 an oracle had

directed the Athenians to bring home the bones of

Theseus; but it was not till b. c. 469 that the

island was conquered, and the bones conveyed to

Athens, where they were preserved in the Theseium.

Cimon expelled the Dolopians from the island, and

peopled it with Athenian settlers. (Thuc. Diod. ILcc.;

Plut The*. 36, Can. 8; on the date of the conquest

of Scyros, which Clinton erroneously places in h. c.

476, see Grote, History of Greece, vol. v. p. 409.)

From this time Scyros was subject to Athens, and

was regarded even at a later period, along with

I,emnos and Imbros, as a possession to which the

Athenians had special claims. Thus the peace of

Antalcidas, which declared the independence of all

the Grecian states, nevertheless allowed the Athenians

to retain possession of Scyros, Lemnos, and Imbros

(Xen. Hell iv. 8. § 15, v. 1. §31); and though the

Macedonians subsequently obtained possession of

these islands, the Romans compelled Philip, in the

peace concluded in b. c. 196, to restore them to the

Athenians. (Liv. xxxiii. 30.) The soil of Scyros

was unproductive (Dem. c. C'allip, p. 1238; Eustath.

ad Horn. It. ii. p. 782 ; Suidas,#. u. apxh 2fcupi'a); but

it was celebrated for its breed of goats, and for its

quarries of variegated marble. (Strab. ix. p. 437;

Allien, i. p. 28, xii. p. 5-10; Zenob. ii. 18; Plin.

xxxvi. 16. s. 26.)

Scyros is divided into two parts by a narrow

isthmus, of which the southern half consists of-high

rugged mountains. The northern half is not so

mountainous. The modern town of St. George^ on

the eastern side of the island, stands upon the site

of the ancient town. It covers the northern and

western sides of a high rocky peak, which to the

eastward falls steeply to the sea; and hence Homer

correctly describes the ancient city as the lofty

Scyros (2,Kvpoi' aiiruav, H, i. 664). The Hellenic

walls are still traceable in many parts. The city was

barely 2 miles in circumference. On the isthmus

south of Scyros a deep bay still retains the name of

Achilli ('Ax»'*^*)i which is doubtless the site of the

Achilleion, or sanctuary of Achilles, mentioned by

Eu* tat hi us (ad II. ix. 662). Athena was the

divinity chiefly worshipped at Scyros. Her temple

stood upon the shore close to the town. (Stat.

AchUl. i. 285, ii. 21.) Tournefort says that he

saw some remains of columns and cornices of white

nimble, close by a forsaken chapel, on the left band

going into the fort of St. George; these are probably

remains of the temple of Athena. (Tournefort,

Voyage, vol. i. p. 334, trans.; Leake, Northern

Greece, vol. iii. p. 106, seq.; Fiedler, Reise, vol. ii.

p. 66; Ross, Wanikrungm in Griechenland^ toI. ii.

p. 32, seq.)
