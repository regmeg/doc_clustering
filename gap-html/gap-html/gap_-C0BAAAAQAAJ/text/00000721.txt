is not noticed by any other writer; but it may pos­

(iii. 2. § 3), and which seems to derive its name

from the town of Pitane. [L. S.]

PIT1NUM (Torre di Pitino), a town of the

Vestini, known only from the Tabula Peutingeriana,

which places it on a line of road from Interocrea

(Antrodoco) to Avcia. But the stations on each

side of it, Prifemum and Eruli, are both unknown,

and the distances probably corrupt. Hence, this

itinerary affords us no real clue to its position.

But Holstenius has pointed out that the name is

retained by the 7'orre di Pitino, about 2 miles N.

of A qmla, and has also shown that in the middle

ages Pitinum still subsisted as a city, and was an

episcopal see. (Tab. Pent.; Holsten. Not. ad Clmer.

p. 139; Romanelli, voL iii. p. 280). [E. H. B.]

F1TULUM (Pitulanus; Piolo), a town of Um-

bria, mentioned only by Pliny (iii. 14. s. 19), who,

enumerates among the towns of that region the

"Pitulani, cognominc Pisuertes et alii Mergentini."

Both names are otherwise unknown, but according

to Cluverius there is a village called Piulo in the

Apennines between Camerino and Matilica, which

probably retains the mime of one or the other.

(Cluver. flal. p. 614.) [E. H. Ii.J

PITYEIA (niTiJeia: Etk IIitwui), a town of

Mysia, on the coast of the Propontis, between Parium

and Priapus. It is mentioned even in the time of

Homer, (/i ii. 829; comp. Apollon. Rhod. i. 933;

Strab. xiii. 588; Steph. B. t. v.) It is said to have

derived its name from the firs which grew there in

abundance, and is generally identified with the

modern Shamelii. [L. S.]

l'lTYCDES (IltTvcioV), a small island in the

Propontis off tho coast of Bithynia, near Cape Hyris,

and 110 stadia to the north of Cape Acritas. (Plin.

v. 44; Steph. B. *. v. niToowrtroi, who speaks of

several islands of this name, which is the same as

IlrrvuSftr.) The island is probably the one now

called Bojuk Ada, where Pococke (vol. iii. p. 147)

found remains of an ancient town. [L. S.]

1'ITYONE'SOS, a small island in the San.nic

gulf, lying between Aegina and the coast of Epi-

daurus, and distant 6 miles from the latter. (Plin.

iv. 12. s. 19.)

PITYUS (riiTvoCf: Pittunda'), a Greek town in

Asiatic Sarmatia, on the north-eastern coast of the

Black Sea, N. of Dioscurias, from which it was

distant 360 stadia according to Artemidorus, and

350 according to Arrian. The real distance, how­

ever, is underrated by these writers; for from C.

lehuria (Dioscurias) to PiUunda is not less than

400 stadia in a straight line. (Arteinidor. ap. Strab.

xi. p. 496; Arrian, Per. P. Eta. p. 18.) Artemi­

dorus described it as the great Pityus, and Pliny as

an "oppidum opulentissimum;" but between the

time of Artemidorus and Pliny it was destroyed by

the Heniochi (Plin. vL 5), whence Arrian mentions it

only as a place for anchorage, anil the name does

not occur at all in Ptolemy. The town was after­

wards rebuilt by the Romans, and is described by

Zosimns (i. 32), in the history of Gallienus, as a for­

tress surrounded with a very great wall, and having

a most excellent harbour. (Comp. Procop. B. Goth.

iv. p. 473, ed. Bonn; comp. C. MQUer, ad Arrian.
