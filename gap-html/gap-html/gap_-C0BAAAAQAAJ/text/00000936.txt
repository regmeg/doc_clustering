Thermae Constantinianae, the last erected at

Home. They are mentioned by Aurelius Victor as

an " opus eacteris hand multo dUpar" (fae*. 40.

27). In the lime of Du Perac, there were still

some vestiges of them on the Quirinal, on the site

of the present Palazzo Rospiglum; but they have

now entirely disappeared. At one time the colossal

figures on Mont': Cavallo stood near these baths,

till Sixtus V. caused them to be placed before the

Quirinal palace. Tradition connects them with the

Equi Tiridatis Regis Amneniorum, mentioned in

the Notitia in the 7th Region; in which case they

would belong to the time of Xero. On the other

hand they claim to be the works of Phidias and

Praxiteles; but there is no means of deciding this

matter.

Besides tlie baths here enumerated, the Xotitta and

Curhsum mention, in the 13th Region, but under

mutilated forms, certain Thermae Suranae kt

Dkcianae, to which we have already alluded in the

51 li Section. They do not, however, seem to have

been of much importance, and their history is un­

known.

XVII. The Bridges.

Rome possessed eight or nine bridges; but the

accounts of them arc .so very imperfect that there

are not above two or three the history of which can

he satisfactorily ascertained. The Tons Subli-

cius, the oldest and one of the most frequently men­

tioned of all the Roman bridges, is precisely that

whose site is most doubtful. It was built of wood,

as ius name imports, by Ancus Marcius, in order to

connect the Janiculum, which he had fortified, with

tiie city. (Liv. i. 33; Dionys. iii. 4,").) It was

considered of such religious importance that it was

under the special care of the pontifices (Varr. L. L.

v. § 83), and was repaired from time to time, even

down to the reign of Antoninus Pius. (Capitol.

Ant. P. 8.) Nay that it must have existed in the

time of Constantine is evident, not only from its

being mentioned in the Xotitta, but also from the

fact of a bridge at Constantinople being named after

it, no doubt to perpetuate in that city the remem­

brance of its sacred character. (Jhscr. Const. Peg.

xiv.) Yet the greatest.diftcren.ee of opinion prevails

with regard to its situation; and as this question

also involves another respecting the site of the

Pons Aemilics, we shall examine them both to­

gether.

We shall first consider the cdrrninsiiKTs task"

which the Sublician bridge was built; uj& li*t in­

quire into the passages in ancient anihoa reprise

it. Whether Ancus Marcius likewise baft »»:.*<■

the other. An inference might perhaps be drawn

from a passage in Seneca, compared with another in

Plant us, in favour of the bridge being outside of the

Porta Trigemina: "In Sublicium Pontem me trans­

fer et inter e^entes me abige: non ideo tamen me

despiciam, quod in illorum numero consideo, qui

As the Pons Sublicius is here shown to have been

the haunt of beggars, so Plautus intimates that their
