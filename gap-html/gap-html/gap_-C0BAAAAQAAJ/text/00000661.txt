fee*, where Pergamum was situated, two

ths Sextons and Cetins, emptied them-

selves into the Cai'cus; the Sclinus flowed through

the city itself, while the Cetius washed its walls.

(Strab. xiii. p. 619; Plin. v. 33; Paus. vi. 16. § 1;

Liv. xxxvii. 18.) Its distance from the sea was

120 stadia, but communication with the sea was

effected by the navigable river CaTcus. Pergammn,

which is first mentioned by Xenophon (Auub. vii. 8.

§ 8), was originally a fortress of considerable natural

strength, being situated on the summit of a conical

hill, round the foot of which there were at that time

no bouses. Subsequently, however, a city arose at

the foot of the hill, and the latter then became the

acropolis. We have no information as to the founda­

tion of the original town on the hill, but the Per-

gamenians believed themselves to be the descendants

of Arcadians, who had migrated to Asia under the

leadership of the Heracleid Telephus (Paus. i. 4.

§ 5); they derived the name of their t<iwn from

Pergamus, a son of Pyrrhus, who was believed to

have arrived there with his mother Andromache,

and, after a successful combat with Alius, the ruler

of Teuthrania, to have established himself there.

(Paus. i. 11. §2.) Another tradition stated that

Asclepius, with a colony from Epidaurus, proceeded

to Pergamum; at all events, the place seems to have

been inhabited by many Greeks at the time when

Xenophon visited it. Slill, however, Pergamum

remained a place of not much importance until the

time of Lysimachus, one of the generals of Alexander

the Great. This Lysimachus chose Pergamum as

a place of security for the reception and preserva­

tion of his treasures, which amounted to 9000

talents. The care and superintendence of this trea­

sure was intrusted to Philetaerus of Tium, an eunuch

from his infancy, and a person in whom Lysimachus

placed the greatest confidence. For a time Phile­

taerus answered the expectations of Lysimachus, but

having been ill-treated by Arsinoe, the wife of his

master, ho withdrew his allegiance and declared

himself independent, B. c. 283. As Lysimachus

was prevented by domestic calamities from punishing

the offender, Philetaerus remained in undisturbed

possession of the town and treasures for twenty years,

contriving by dexterous management to maintain

peace with his neighbours. He transmitted his

principality to a nephew of the name of Eumenes,

who increased the territory he had inherited, and

even gained a victory over Antiochus, the son of

Selcucus, iu the neighbourhood of Sardes. After a

reign of twenty-two years, from R. c. 263 to 241, he

was succeeded by his cousin Attains, who, after a

great victory over the Galatians, assumed the title

of king, and distinguished himself by his talents and

sound policy. (Strab. xiii. pp. 623, 624; Polyb.

xviii. 24; Liv. xxxiii. 21.) He espoused the in­

terests of Rome against Philip of Macedonia, and in

conjunction with the Rhodiau fleet rendered im­

portant services to the Romans. It was mainiy this

Attains that amassed the wealth for which his name

became proverbial. He died at an advanced age, iu

B.c. 197, and was succeeded by his son Knmenes 11.,

from B. c. 197 to 159. He continued his friend­

ship with the Romans, and assisted them against

Antiochus the Great and Perseus of Macedonia; after

the defeat of Antiochus, the Romans rewarded his

services by giving to him all the countries in Asia

Minor west of Mount Taurus. Pergamum, the ter­

ritory of which had hitherto not extended beyond

the gulfs of Elaea and Adramyttium, now became a

large and powerful kingdom. (Strub. I. o.; Liv.

xxxviii. 39.) Eumenes 111. was ii'urly killed at
