PYLK'NK (JlvXyvrj: Eth. YIvAtfvtos),an ancient

town of Aetolia, between the Achelous and the Kvenus,

mentioned in the Homeric catalogue of the Grecian

ships, is placed by Pliny on the Corinthian gulf. It

would therefore seem to have existed in later times;

although Strabo says that the Aeolians, having re­

moved Pylene higher up, changed its name into

Proschium. The site of Pylene is uncertain. (Hum.

l'VLUS (TluAor: Eth. T\v\ios), the name of thive

towns ou the western coast of Peloponnesus.

1. A town in hollow Elis, described by Pausanias

as situated upon the mountain road leading from

Elis to Olympia, and at the place where the Ladon

flows into the Peneius (vi. 22. § 5). Strabo, in a

corrupt passage, assigns to it the same situation,

and places it in the neighbourhood of Scollium or

Mt. Scollis (fxfTa^u rov Hijveiou teal rov SeAA^tc-

tos €kSo\T]S [read koI tjjs rov 2eKArjevros t/j.-

SoAtjs] TlvKos tpicttTO, Strab. viii. p. 338). Pausa-

nias (I.e.) says that it was 80 stadia from Elis.

I>iodorus (xiv. 17) gives 70 stadia as the distance,

and Pliny (iv. 5. s. 6) 12 Roman miles. According

to the previous description, Pylus should probably be

identified with the ruins at Agrdptdho-khdri,situated

on a commanding position in the angle formed by the

junction of the Peneius and Ladon. This site is

distant 7 geographical miles from Elis. which suffi­

ciently agrees with the 80 stadia of Pausanias.

Leake, however, places Pylus further at the ruins

at Kufatjli, mainly on the ground that they are not so

far removed from the mad between Elis and Olympia.

Rut the fact of the ruins at Ayrdpidho-kh'tri being

at the junction of the Peneius and Ladon seems de­

cisive in favour of that position ; and we may sup­

pose that a road ran up the valley of the Peneius to

the junction of the two rivers, and then took a bend

to the right into the valley of the Ladon. (Leake,

Northern Greece, vol. ii. p. 228, PeJoponnesiaca,

p. 219; Bobiaye, Recherchts, (fc. p. 122; Curtius,

Peloponnesus, vol. ii. p. 39.) The Eleian Pylus is

saiil to have been built by the Pylon, son of Cleson

of Megara, who founded the Messenian Pylus, and

who, upon being expelled from the latter place by

Peleus, settled at the Eleian Pylos. (Pans. iv. 36.

§ l,vi.22.§ ,">.) Pylus was said to have been destroyed

by Hercules, and to have been afterwards restored

by the Eleians; but the story of its destruction by

Hercules more properly belongs to the Messenian

Pylus. Its inhabitants asserted that it was the town

which Homer had in view when he asserted that the

Alpheius flowed through their territory ('AA<£»« *ou,

'6-rr' fiipb f>4ct IluAiW 5ia yairjs, II. v. 545). On

the position of the Homeric Pylus we shall speak

presently; and we only observe here, that this claim

was admitted by Pausanias (vi. 22.5} 6), though its

abMirdity had been previously pointed out by Strabo

(viii. n. 350, seq.). Like the other Eleian towns,

Pylus is raiely mentioned in history. In P. C. +02

it was taken by the Spartans, in their invasion of the

territory of Elis (Diod. xiv. 17); and in d. r. 366

it is mentioned as the place where the derr-vniri

exiles from Elis planted themselves in order to ran"

on war against the latter city. (Xen. BeH rx i

§ 1 6.) Pausam'as saw only the rains of iMm (*

22. § 5), and it would appear to have \xtn dessr.t

long previously.
