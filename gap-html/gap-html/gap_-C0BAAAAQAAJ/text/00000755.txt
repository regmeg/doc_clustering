modern name is derived from the island of J/armoivi,

the ancient Proconnesus, near the western entrance

of the sea. (Appal o!e Mund. p. 6; Steph. B. #. r.

npoiroirfy.) The first authors who mention the Pro-

pontis under this name are Aeschylus (Pert. 87ft),

Herodotus (iv. 85), and Scylax (pp.28, 35); and

Herodotus seems even to have made an accurate

measurement of this sea. of which he states the length,

to be 1400 stadia, and the breadth 500. Later writers

such ns Strabo (ii. p. 125) and Agathemerus (ii.

14), abandoning the correct view of their prede­

cessor, state that the breadth of the Propontis is

almost equal to its length, although, assuming the

Propontis to extend as far as Byzantium, they

include in its length a portion of the Thraciait

Bosporus. Modern geographers reckon about 120

miles from one strait to the other, while the greatest

breadth of the Propontis from the European to the

Asiatic coast does not exceed 40 miles. The form

of the Propontis would be nearly oval, were it not

that in its south-eastern part Mt. Arganthonius

with the promontory of Poseidion forms two deep

bays, that of Astacus [Sinus Astacknus] and that

of Cius [Cianus Sinis], The most important

cities on the coasts of the Propontis are: Pkrix-

THUS, N M vr.l.il. BVZAMT1U.M, ChALCKDON,

Astacus, Curs, and Cvzicus. In the south-west

there are several islands, as PuoooKNESirs, OpiifUHA,

and Alonr: at the eastern extremity, south of

Chalcedon, there is a group of small islands called

Demosnesi, while one small island, Besbicus, is situ­

ated in front of the bay of Cius. (Comp. Polyb. iv.39,

town of Actolia, between the Achelous and the Evenus,

is said to have been founded by the Aeolians when

into the country. [PrijotE.] Proschium also laid

claim to high antiquity, since it possessed a shrine

said to have been dedicated by Hercules to his cup-

liearer Cyathus, whom he had unintentionally slain.

It is clear, from a narrative of Thucydides, that

Proschium lay west of Calydon and Pleuron, and at

no great distance from the Achelous. Leake places

it on the western part of Mt. Zyynt (the ancient

Aracynthus). near the monastery of St. Gtcrtjt
