ANAGER or TANAGKUS (Tanagro), a river

iraaia, m tributary of the Silaru*. It rises in

uvouiitaiita near Logo Negro, hWs for about

30 miles in a XNK. direction, throngh a broad and

level upland valley called the Valie di Diano, till

near Jai Polla it sinks into the earth, and emerges

airain through a cavern at a place thence called La

Pertusa. This peculiarity is mentioned by Pliny,

who calls it "fluvius in Atinate campo," without

mentioning its name (Plin. ii. 103. s. 106, with

Harduin's note): but this is known to us from

Virgil, who notices it in connection with Mount

Alburn us, which rises immediately to the W. of it,

and the epithet "siccus" which he applies to it

(*■ sicci ripa Tanagri ") doubtless refers to this same

peculiarity. (Virg. Georg. iii. 151; Serv. ad loe.;

Vib. Seq. p. 19.) There is no doubt, also, that in

the Itinerary we should read * Ad Tanagrum" for

uAd Tanarum" a station which it places on the

road from Sulernum to Nerulum. (Itin. Ant. p. 109.)

The same Itinerary gives a station "Ad Calorem,"

as the tiext on this line of route, which seems to

show that the river was then, as now, called in the

upper part of its course Calor or Colore, while in

the lower part it assumes the name of Tanagro or

Negro. This part of tho route, however, is very

confused. [E. H. B.]

TAN AGRA (ToWypa: Eth. Tavayp<uQ%>. the

territory Tayuypala, Paus. ix. 22. § 1, and

Tavaypaiidi or Tavarypitci), Strab. ix. p. 404: Adj.

Tavaypitcds: Grtmadha or Grhnata), a town of

Boeotia, situated upon the left bank of the Asopus,

in a fertile plain, at the distance of 130 stadia f rom

Oropus and 200 from Plataeae (Dicaearch. Stat. Gr.

pp. 12. 14, ed. Hudson). Several ancient writers

identified Tanagra with the Homeric Graea (rpala,

Horn. // ii. 498; Lycophr. 644); but others supposed

them to be distinct places, and Aristotle regarded

Oropus as the ancient Graea. (Steph. B. «. v.

Tdvaypa; Strab. ix. p. 404 ; Paus. ix. 20. § 2.)

It is possible, as Leake has remarked, that Tanagra,

sometimes written Tanagraea, may be connected with

the ancient name Graea, Tana, being an Aeolic suffix,

and that the modern name Grimddha or Grinuila

may retain traces of the Homeric name. Tanagra was

also called Poemandria, and its territory Poemandris,

fmm the fertile meadows which surrounded the city.

(Steph. B. t. v.; Strab. ix. p. 404.) The most ancient

inhabitants of Tanagra are said to have been the

Gephyraei, who cume from Phoenicia with Cadmus,

and from thence emigrated to Athens. (Herod, v.

57; Strab. ix. p. 404). Prom its vicinity to Atticu

tbe territory of Tanagra was the scene of more than

one battle. In B. c. 457 the Lacedaemonians on

their return from an expedition to Doris, took up a

position at Tanagra, near the Ixmlers of Attica, with

the view of assisting the oligarchical party at Alliens

to overthrow the democracy. The Athenians, with

u thousand Argeians and some Theasalian hor>e,

crossed Mount Panics and advanced against the

Lacedaemonians. Both sides fought with great

bravery; but the Lacedaemonians gained the victory,

chiefly through the treacherous desertion of the

Thessalians in the very heat of the engagement.

(Thuc. i. 107, 108; Diod. xi. 80.) At the U*gin-

ingof the following year(n. c. 456), and only sixty-

two days after their defeat at Tanagra, the Athenians

under alymniiles again invaded Boeotia, and gained

at Oenophyta, in the territory of Tanagra, a brilliant

and decisive victory over the Boeotians, which made

them masters of tbe whole country. The walls of

Tanagra were now raxed to the ground. (Thuc i.

108; Diod. xi. 81, 82.) I n n. r. 426 the Athenians

made an incursion into the territory of Tanagra, and
