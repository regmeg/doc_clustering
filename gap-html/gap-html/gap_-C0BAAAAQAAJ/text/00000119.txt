ITON. 101 JULIACUM.

lTOXor ITONUS ('iToi'.IIom.j'lTai'oSjStrab.),

a town of Phthiotis in Thessaly. called by Homer

"motber of flocks " (//. ii. 61*6), was situated 60

stadia from AJus, upon the river Cuarius or Coralius,

and shore the Crocian plain. (.Strab. ix. p. 435.)

Leske supposes the KhoUj to be the Cuarius, and

places itonus near the spot where the river issues

from the mountains ; and as, in that case, Iton pos­

sessed a portion of the jastoral highlands of Othrys,

th« epithet " mother of flocks" api*"ars to have been

well adapted to it. (Leake, Northern Greece, vol.

iv. pp. 356, 357.) Iton had a celebrated temple of

AUwna, whose worship, under the name of the

Itonian Athena, was carried by the Boeotians, when

they were expelled from Thessaly, into the country

mined after them. (Strab. I. c; Steph. B. s. v.;

ApJlod. ii. 7. § 7.; Appollon. i. 551, with Schol.j

Cailim. Hymn, in Cer. 74.; Pans. i. 13. § 2, iii. 9.

§ 13. ix. 34. § 1, x. 1. § 10 ; Plut. Pgrrh. 26.)

ITCNE ClTiiirn), a town in Lydia of unknown

site. (Dionys. Per. 465; Steph. B.'*. r.) [L. S.]

ITUCCI (Plin. iii. 1. s. 3), or ITUCI (loins;

1»*ns, Appian, Ilisp. 66, 68), a city in the W. of

Hispania Baetica. Under tlie Romans, it was a

rvloniii immunis, with the surname Yiirrrs Julia,

and it belonged to the conventus of Hispalis. Its

ur.babk site, in the opinion of Ukert, was between

M'irtoi and Espejo, near Valenzncla. (Ukert, vol.

ii. pt. 1. p. 369 ; Coins, tip. Florez, Med. dc Esp.

vol. ii. p. 487; ilionnct, vol. i. p. 18, Suppl. vol. i.

p. 32; Sestini, p. 63 ; Eclchel, vol. i. p. 24.) [P. S.]

1TUXA, in Britain, mentioned by Ptolemy (ii. 3.

§ 2) as an actuary immediately to the north of the

Moriatmbe acstuary = Morccambe. Bay. This

identifies it with the Sol/ray Firth. [R. G. L.]

ITUEAEA ('iToi/pam), a district in the NE. of

Palestine (Strab. xvi. p. 755; Plin. v. 19), which,

with Traclionitis, belonged to the tetrarchy of Philip.

(St lake, iii. 1; comp. Joseph. Ant. xv. 10. § 1.)

The name is «o loosely applied by the ancient writers

that it is difficult to fix its boundaries with precision,

bat it may be said roughly to be traversed by a line

drawn from the Lake of Tiberias to Damascus. It

w« a mountainous district, and full of caverns

(."trab. I.e.): the inhabitants, a wild race (Cic/'AtV.ii.

24). favoured by the natural features of the country,

were in the habit of robbing the traders from Da­

mascus (Strab. xvi. p. 756), and were famed as

archers. (Virg. Georg. ii. 448 ; Lucan.vii. 230, 514.)

At an early period it was occupied by the tribe of

Jetur {\Ckron. v. 19; "iToopoTot, LXX.), whose name

ii connected with that of Jetur, a son of Ishmael.

(1 Ckron. i. 31.) The Ituraeans — either the de-

wendanta of the original possessor, or, as is more

probable, of new comers, who had occupied this

district after the exile, and assumed the original name

—were eventually subdued by king Aristobulus, B.C.

100. who compelled them to be circumcised, and

iaarporated them in his dominions. (Joseph. Ant.

xUi. 11. §3.) The mountain district was in the

land* of Ptolcmaeus, tetrarch of Chalcis (Strab. xvi.

p.753); but when Poinjfeius came into Syria, Ituraca

was ceded to the Romans (Appian. Mitltr. 106),

though probably it retained a certain amount of

impendence under native vassal princes: M. An-

toehu imposed a heavy tribute upon it. (Appian,

K. C. r. 7.) Finally, under Claudius, it became

pari of the province of Syria. (Tac Ann. xii. 23;

I>v«i Cms. lix. 12.) The district EUDjedur, to the

E. of Hermon (lijtbtl rih-Schrikh), and lying W. of

tie Uadj road, which according to Burckuardl

(Trav. p. 286) now contains only twenty inhabited

villages, comprehended the whole or the greater

part of ancient Ituraea. (Sliinter, de Rib. Ituraeor.

1TYS, in Britain, mentioned by Ptolemy (ii. 3.

§ 1) as a river lying north of the Epidian proinon-

tory (Af«// of Cantyre), with the river Longus 1«-

tween. As this latter = Loch Limilic, the Jtys is

probably the Sound of Skat, between the hie of

Shje and the mainland. In the Monnmenta Bri­

tannia* we have Loch Torridon. Loch liuich. Loch

IVERXIA. [Iernk.]

IVEKXIS('Iovepi'fs), mentioned by Ptolemy (ii. 2.

§ 10)as one ot'the inland towns of Ireland, the others

being Rhigia, Rhaeba, Laberus, Macolicum, another

Rhaeba, Dunum. Of these, Dunum has been identified

with JJown, and Macolicum with Mallow, on the

strength of the names. Laberus, on similar but less

satisfactory ground, = Kil-iWr in IIY.i* Mtath.

Ivernus is identified by O'Connor with jMm-keron,

on the Kemnare river; but the grounds on which

this has been done are unstated. [K. G. L.j

JULIA COXSTAXTLA. [Osset.]

JULIA F1DKNTIA. [Uua.]

JULIA JOZA ('IouAfa '\6(a), a city on the coast

of Hispania Baetica, between Gades mid Belon,

colonized by a population of Romans mixed with the

removed inhabitants of the town of Zelis, near Tingis,

on the Libyan shore of the Straits. Thus far Strabo

(iii. p. 140): later writers speak of a place named

Jri.tATRANSDUCTA.or simply Tkansducta (Ioo-

\ia Tpai/ooovKTa, Ptol. ii. 4. § 6; Marcian. lleracl.

p. .39; Geog. Raw), E. of Mellaria; and toins are

extant with the epigraph julia thadlcta (Florcz,

Med. de Exp. vol. ii. p. 59G, Esp. S. vol. x. p. 50;

Mionnct, vol. i. ]). 26, Suppl. vol. i. pp. 19, 45;

Sestini, Med. Jsp. p. 90; Num. Goth.; Eckhel,

vol. i. pp. 29—.31). Jlela does not mention the

place by either of these names; but, after speaking

of Carteia, he adds the following remarkable words:

et quam transrecti ex Africa Phoenices habitant,

atqtte wide no* gumus, Tinffentera, (Mela, ii. 0.)

It can hardly be doubled that all these statements

refer to the same place; nay, the very names arc

identical, Traiwbicto, being only the Latin trans­

lation of the word Joza (from nV\ egretsus est)

used by the Phoenician inhabitants to describe the

origin of the city. Its site must have been at or

near Tarifa, in the middle of the European shore of

the Straits, and on the S.-most jtoint of the j^n-

insula. (J/eiw. <k [Acad, dm Inter, p. 10.3 ; I'hiloi.
