Strab. xvii. p. 799; Pomp. Mela, i. 8. § 2; Plin. v.

cles), a town of Marmarka, which was also called

Ammonia. fA^uiawia, Strab. /. c.) Its celebrity

was owing to its spacious harbour, extending to 40

stadia (Strab. /. c.; comp. Diod. i. 31), but which

appears to have been difficult to make. (Lucian,

Quomodo historna sit conscribenda, 62.) Parae-

tonium was 1300 stadia (Strab./. c; 1550 stadia,

Stadiasm. § 19) from Alexandreia. From this

point Alexander, b. c. 332, set out to visit the

oracle of Amnion. (Arrian. Anab. iv. 3. § 3.) When

the "world's debate" was decided at Actium, An-

tonius stopped at Paraetonium, where some Roman

troops were stationed under Pinarius f r the defence

of Aegypt. (Plut. Anton. 70; Flor. iv. 11.) The

name occurs in Latin poetry. (Ovid, Met. ix. 772,

Amoves, ii. 13. 7; Lucan. iii. 295.) Justinian for-

tified it as a frontier fortress to protect Aegypt from

attacks on the W\ ( Procop.de ./Ierf. vi. 2.) An imperial

coin of the elder Faustina has been assigned to this

place, but on insufficient grounds. (Eckhel, vol. iv.

p. 116.) When the Aoulad Aly were sovereigns

over this district, the site, where there were ancient

remains, retained the name of Baretoun; but after

their expulsion by the paaba of Aegypt, it was

called Berth Marsah. (Pacho, Voyage dans la

PARAGON SINUS (Tlaptryuv irrfAwoj, Ptol. vi.

lemy. Slarcian states that it was of considerable

size, and extended as far as the promontory called

Alambater (now Has Guadel) and the island of

of Gedrosia which was inhabited bythe Khthyophagi:

it is not, however, noticed in NearchWa voyage, [V.]

PARALATS (IlopoAa(i), a town of Lycaoniu, and,

as its name seems to indicate, situated near u lake.

(Ptol. v. 6. § 16.) There are coins bearing the in­

scription "Jul. Aug. Col. Parlais" (Eckhel. voL iii.

p. 33. foil.), from which it appears that the plare

was made a Roman colony. But as the town and

its elevation to the rank of a colony is not mentioned

elsewhere, it has been supposed that the coins are

either forced or have been incorrectly read [L.S-3

preserved by Strabo, who rays that it stood at a
