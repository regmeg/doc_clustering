of its waters. (Vitruv. viii. 3; Antic. Caryst. 150;

Plin. I. c.) Pliny (xxxi. 2) mentions bituminous

springs in the vicinity, which art? reported by

Beaufort to exist at Bikhardy, about six hours' walk

to the north-east of Mezetfu. [L. S.]

SOLI or SOLOE (2<iAo<, Ptol. v. 14. § 4), an

important seaport town in the W. part of the N.

coast of Cyprus situated on a .small river. (Strab.

xiv. p. 683.) According to Plutarch {Sol. 26) it

was founded by a native prince at the suggestion of

SuliHi and named in honour of that legislator. The

sojourn of Solon in Cyprus is mentioned by He­

rodotus (v. 113). Oilier accounts, however, make

it an Athenian settlement, founded under the

auspices of Ph&lcrus and Acamas (Strab. /. c), or of

JJemophon, the son of Theseus (Pint. /. r). We

learn from Strabo (1. c.) that it had a temple of

Aphrodite and one of Jsis; and from Galen (r/e

Simp, Med. ix. 3, S) that there were mines in its

neighbourhood. The inhabitants were called Solii

(2<).\ioi). to distinguish them from the citizens of

Soli in Cilicia, who were called 5oA.eI* ("'"g-

Laert, V. Sohm, 4). According to Pococke (ii. p.

323), the valley which surrounded the city is still

called Solea; and the ruins of the town itself may

lie traced in the village of Alvjora. (Comp. Aescli

SOLIA. [Akab IIksperi.]

SOLICPNIUM, a town in the Agri Decumales, in

South-western Germany, on Mount Pirus, where

Vatentiuian in a. i> 369 gained a victory over the

Alemamii. (Aimii. Marc, xxvii. 10, xxviii. 2, xxx.

7.) A variety of conjectures have been made to

identify the site of the town, but there are no

]>ositive criteria to arrive at any satisfactory con­

clusion. [L. S.]

SOLlMAIilACA, in Gallia, is placed in the

Antonine Itin. on the road from Andomatunum

( Langre*) to Tulluin Leucorum (Totd), and nearly

half-way between Mosa (Meuse) and Tullum. There

is a place named S<>ulos^y which in name and in

position agrees with Soliinariaca. "The trace of the

Roman road is still marked in several places by its

elevation, both mi this side of Soulowe and beyond it

on the road to Toul" (D'Anville,Notice, cfc.)[G. L.]

SOLIMNIA, a small island of the Aegaean sea,

off the coast of Thessaly, near .Scopelos. (l'lin. iv.

SOLIS INSULA (Plin. vi. 22. s. 24), an island

mentioned by Pliny l>etween the mainland of India

and Ceyfon, in the strait. There can bo no doubt

that it is the present Ramiaeram Cor, famous for a

temple uf Kama. It bore also the name of Kwpu

SOLIS FONS. [Oasis, p. 458.]

SOLIS PORTUS (H\iov A^>, Ptol. vii.4.§ 6),

a harbour near the SE. comer of Taprobanc (Ccyluti).

It has been conjectured by Korbiger that it is the

present \'(?tdchisbai,— & name we do not discover on

the best maps. Its position, south of the Malea

mountains (Adanis Peak), is certain. [V.]

SOUS PROMONTO'KIUM (Tfpa'HMou &Kpa),

"Sacra solis extrema," a promontory of the east
