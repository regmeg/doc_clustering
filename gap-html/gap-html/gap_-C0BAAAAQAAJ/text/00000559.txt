of Arhaia, anil originally one of the

iaa, was situated on the coast, and on

■tsf tkt river Peirns, 40 stadia from

■a League in B. c. 280, it sppesrs that

■a sjl m aiiiain u Strabo says that it

did not join the league; but the inhabitants subse­

quently abandoned the town, and retired to the

neighbouring villages of Peirae (ITeipai), and Eury-

teiae (EvpvrciaC), and to Dyme. In the time of

Polybius, however, Oienus was no longer inhabited;

and in the time of Strabo it was in ruins, and its

territory belonged to Dyme. There are some remains

of the ancient city at Kato or Palea-Akhaia. (Herod,

i. 145; Pol. ii. 41; Strab. viii. pp. 384, 386, 388;

Paus. vii. 18. § 1, vii. 22. § 1; Plin. iv. 6, Olenum;

208 ; Thirlwall, Hist of Greece, vol. viii. p. 82.)

O'LERUS ("nAepot, Xenion, ap. Steph. B. s. v.:

Eth. 'flAe'pior, Bockh, Inscr. vol. ii. No. 2555; Eus-

tath. ad II. ii. p. 664), a town of Crete, situated on

a hill, with a temple to Athene. In the struggle

between Cnossus and Lyctus, the people of Olerus

sided with the latter. (Polyb. iv. 53, where the

reading "Opioi appears to be a mistake.) In the

Descrizione dell' I tola di Candia, A. D. 1538 (ap.

Mus. Class. Antiq. vol. ii. p. 271), the site is occupied

by a place called Castel Messelerius. (Hock,

OLGASSYS ("OA700-0-1/S), a lofty and inacces­

sible mountain on the frontiers of Paphlagonia and

Galatia, extending from the Halys in a south-western

direction towards the Sangarius, and containing the

sources of the Parthcnius. The surrounding country

was filled with temples erected by the Paphlagonians.

(Strab. xii. p. 562.) The mountain mentioned by

Ptolemy (v. 4. § 4) under the name of Ligas, Gigas,

or Oligas, is probably the same as the Olgassys of

Strabo. It still bears its ancient name in the corrupt

form of Ulgaz, and modern travellers state that some

parts of the mountain are covered with snow nearly

all the year. [L. S.]

OLl'ARUS ('flAfapoj, Olearus, Plin., Virg.: Eth.

from Pares. (Heracleid. ap. Steph. B. J. v.; Strab.

X. p. 485 1 Plin. iv. 12. s. 22; Virg. Aen. iii.

which has been described by several modern travel­

lers. (Toumefort, Voyage, (fc. vol. i. p. 146, seq.,
