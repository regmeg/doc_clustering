SATUTiNIA (SaTo^'i'ia: Satumia), an ancient

city of' Ktruria, situated in the valley of the Albiuia

(Albet/na), about 24 miles from its month. There

is no doubt that it way an ancient Etruscan city;

and as Pliny tells us that it was previously called

Aurinia (iii. 5. s. 8), it is probable that tins was

its Etruscan name, and that it first received that of

Satumia at the time of the Roman colony. But no

mention of it is found in history during the period

of Etruscan iiuic]>ondcnce; and there is certainly no

ground for the supposition of Miiiler that it was one

of the twelve cities of the Etruscan League. (Miii­

ler, Ptrwb-r, vol. i. p. 350.) Dionysius indeed

mentions it as one of the cities founded by the Pe-

lasgians, and subsequently taken from them by the

Tyrrhenians and Etruscans (l)ionys. i. 20); but

though this is strong evidence for the antiquity of

the city, there- is no proof that it was ever a plat e of

importance under the Etruscans; and it even seems

probable that before the close of their rule, Satumia

hail sunk into the condition of a subordinate town,

and a mere dependency of Caletra. At least it is

remarkable that Livy, in speaking of the establish­

ment of the Roman colony there, says that it was

settled "in agio Caletrano." (Liv. xxxix. 55.)

The foundation of ihis colony, which was established

in B.C. 183, is the only historical fact recorded to

us concerning Satumia; it was a " colonia civium,"

and therefore would naturally retain its colonial

rank even at a late period. Pliny, however, calls

it only an ordinary municipal town, but Ptolemy

gives it the rank of a colony, and it is mentioned as

such in an inscription of Imperial times. (Plin. iii.

5. s. 8; Pud. iii. 1. § 49; Gruter. Inscr. p. 1093.

8.) It is probable therefore that it received a fresh

colony under the Roman Empire, though we have

no account of the circumstance. But it seems riot

to have been a place of any importance, and the ex­

isting remains which belong to this period are of

little interest.

The modern town of Satumia, which retains the

ancient site as well as name, is but a very poor

place; but its mediaeval walls are based on those of

the ancient city, and the circuit of the latter may

he distinctly traced. It occupied the summit of a

conical hill, surrounded by steep cliffs, about 2 miles

in circuit. Considerable portions of the walls re­

main in several places: these are constructed of

polygonal masonry, resembling that of Cosa, but

built uf travertino; they are supposed by Micali to

belong to the Roman colony, though other writers

would assign them to the Pelasgians, the earliest

inhabitants of Satumia. (Micali, Ant. Pop, Hal.

vol. i. pp. 152, 210; Dennis. Etruria, vol. ii. pp.

308—310.) Numerous tombs are also found in

the neighbourhood of the town, but which more re­

semble lbe cromlechs of northern Europe than the

more regular sepulchres of other Etruscan cities.
