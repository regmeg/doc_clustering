TI'NIA (Tnias: Timia), a small river of llm.

ma, Huang into the Tiber, a few miles below

Vnuia. The name is given by tho ancient geogra-

:brr« lo the affluent of the Tiber (one of the first

nsutarim which that river receives), hot at the

imrnt day the stream called the Timia loses its

Lime after its junction with the Topino, a more

uuddrrmble stream. Four small rivers indeed bring

l«wn their united waters to the Tiber at this point:

. the MnrtKffiiii, which rises between Todt and

>l**Utn, and brings with it the waters of the Cli-

mm, tho ancient Cmtumnus; 2, the Timia,

rhivti jikins the Glitumnus near Mevania (Hc-

>»pi<i); 3, the Tupino, which descends from tho

L|rw)ines near Sooera, and turns abruptly to the

tlV., after receiving the waters of the Timia; and

. ihe CAwucio, which joins the Topino from the

I. only 3 miles from the point where it falls into

Tiber. Though thus augmented from various

outers the Tinia was always an inconsiderable

T>m. I'liny s|ieaks of it as navigable with

ificolly even for boats, and Si I i us Italicus calls it

Tiniae inglorios humor." (SiL Ital. viii. 452;

■fin. iii. 5. s. 9; Strab. v. p. 227.) [E. H. B.]

1 INNK'TIO, a place in Khaetia, mentioned only

itar Autonine Itinerary (p. 277), but still retaining

» urirnt name in the form of Timzen. [L. S.]

TIN'U'KTIt'M, in Gallia, is placed in the Itins.

nr the Satme, between Cabillonum (Chalum) and

l-ilisra (Macon). The Antonine Itin. marks M.P.

ii.. Irucas xiiii. between Cabillonum and Tinur-

tiin, which is Tuumus. Tho Table gives only

i, which appears to be nearer the truth. The

'o Itins. do not agree in the distance between

uranium and Matisco. Spartianus ( Yka Septim.

'"ri, c. 11) says that Scverus defeated Clodius

it-urns at Tinurtium, or Trinurtium, for tire reading

|»rhaps doubtful. (Is. Casaubon, in Aelium Spar-

»'urn notae). Dion (Ixxv. c 6), Herodian (iii. 7),

•1 Kutropim (viii. 18) speak of Clodius Albinus

ft defeated by Severus at or near I-ugdunum

'v»). The name Tinurtiuin appears to be some-

nes miswritten Tiburtium. [G. L.]

TldRA MATIENA. [Abowoixm.]

Tll'AKENUS, an island off the coast of Her­

nia in Argolis, mentioned only by I'liny (iv. 12.

19). It is frequently identified with SpeUia ; but

-tke remarks that Tiparenus has no appearance of  
11 reek name, and conjectures that it is an error

t Tricarenns, the same as the Tricrana of Fau­

nas (ii. 34. § 8) and the modern Trikkiri.

Tike, Mono, vol. ii. p. 465; Boss, Wanderungen

Vritckenland, vol. ii. p. 21).

TIPASA (Tliao-o, PtoL iv. 2. § 5). 1. A town in

I'iretania Caesarienais, endowed with the jus Latii

'.he emperor Claudius (Win. v s. 1) and subse-

•atly a Roman colony (/(in. Ant. p. 15). It luy

'•een Icoainm and Caesarea (/&.). Frocopius

t V. ii. 10) mentions two columns near Tipasa in

- SE. of Mnuretanuv, which had on them the fol-  
■ Ing inscription in the Phoenician language: " We

'fugitives from the face of Joshua, the robber,

1 Lis son Nave." Now Teftuad or Tefeeak.

1. A town in Numidia, on the road from Sicca

Cirta Utin. Ant. p. 411 Now Tebata or Ti-

A. [T.H.D.]

T1PHAE. [Sipiiak.]

TIP1ISAH. [Thai-sacus.]

TIPSUM or TII'SUS (It. Ilier. p. 569), a place

in Thrace, now Sundukii or Karattiui, according to

Lapie. [J. R.]

TTBIDA. [Stabui.um Diomkdim.]

TIRISSA (Geogr. Kav. iv. 6), called by Arrian

Trrpuruu (Per. P. Kux. p. 24), and in tbe Tab.

Pent. Trissa; a fortified place on the promontory of

Tirizis. From its situation on this bold headland

it was sometimes called simply 'Axpa (Steph. B. p.

53; Ilierocl. p. 637), and hence at present Kberne

or Kavarna. [1. H. D.]

TIRISTASIS (Plin. iv. II. a. 18; T««M<rTao-.t,

Scyl. p. 28; Tiouttckw, Kpist. PhiL ad Allt. ap.

Dem. p. 159, It.), a town of the Thracian Cherso-

ncsus, on the coast of the Propontis. It was in­

cluded in the dominioan of Philip, wbo in tbe letter

above referred to complains that the Athenian

general Diopeithes had taken it and sold its inhabit­

ants for slaves (n. c. 340) [DiorEtTiiKS, liicU

Bum/.] According to Choiseul, its site is still occu­

pied by a village bearing the same name. [J. R]

TIRIZIS (Ti'pifu, Strab. vii. p 319), a very pro­

jecting headland of Mocsia in the Pontus Euxiuus.

The name varies, being written Tipifa in Anon.

(Perip. P. Kux. p. 13), Tipurrplr or Tipio-Tpla axpa

by Ptolemy (iii. 10. § 8), and Tiristia by Mela (ii.

2). Now Cape Giilynul. [T. H. I).]

TIKYNS (Tfavn: Elk. Tipw-flior: the name is

perhaps connected with rvfyn, Lepsius, Tyrrh. Pe-

lasger, p. 13), one of the most ancient cities of

Greece, lay a short distance SE. of Argrv, on tho

right of the road leading to Kpidaurus (Paus. ii. 25.

§ 8), and at tho distance of 12 stadia from Nau-

plia. (Strab. viii. p. 373.) Its massive walls,

which have been regarded with wonder in all ages,

are said to have been the work of the Cyclopes,

and belong to the same age as those of Mycenae.

(Paus. ii. 16. § 5, ii. 25. § 8, vii. 25. § 6, ix. 36. §

5; Strab. I. c; Plin. vii. 56. s. 57.) Hence Homer

calls the city Tlpvvs Tfi^ioWoa. (//. ii. 559.)

Pindar speaks of the KvirAwiua wpABvpa of Tiryns

(f'ragm. 642, ed. Bbckh), and Pausanias says that

tho walls arc not less worthy of admiration than the

pyramids of Egypt (ix. 36. § 5.) In another pas­

sage he describes the walls as consisting of wide

masses of stone (0070! AWoi), of such a size, that a

yoke of oxen could not stir the least of them, the

interstices being filled in with smaller stones to

make the whole more compact and solid. (Paus. it

25. § 8.) The foundation of Tiryns ascends to tho

earliest mythical legends of the Argeia. It was

said to have derived its name from Tiryns, the son

of Argus (Pans. ii. 25. § 8), and to have been

founded by Proetus. (Strab. viii. p. 372; Paus. ii.

16. § 2.) According to the common tradition, Me-

gapenthes, the son of Proetus, ceded Tiryns to

Perseus, who transmitted it to his descendant Elec-

tryon. Alcmcna, the daughter of Elcctryon, mar­

ried Amphitryon, who would have succeeded to tho

crown, bad he not been expelled by Slhenelus, king

of Argos. Their son Hercules afterwards refrained

possession of Tiryns, where he lived for many years,

and hence is frequently called Tirynthius by the

poets. (lies. Scut. 81; Pind. OL X. 37, hthm. vi.

39; Virg. Aen. vii. 662; Ov. Met vii. 410.) Al­

though Tiryns was thus closely connected with tho

Heraclidae, yet the city remained in the hands of

the old Achaean population after the return of the

Heraclidae and the conquest of Peloponnesus by the
