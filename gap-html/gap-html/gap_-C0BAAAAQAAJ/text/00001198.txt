1112 TAVRICA CHERSOXESUS. TAURIXI.

taut enough to take a part in political affaire

as an independent city, at least as late as about

the middle of the 2nd century B. c, when, like its

mother city, Heracleia, it wasa party to the alliance

against Pharnaces I., king of Pontus, and Mithri-

dates, satrap of Armenia. (Polyb. Frg. lib. xxvi.

c. 6, vol. iv. p. 345, sqq., ed. Sweigb.) Soon after-

wards, however, ive tin J it struggling with the

Taurians and tlieir allies the Sarmatians for existence

(Polyaen. Strat. viii. c. 56), and it was ultimately

compelled to place itself under the protection of

Mithridates the Great. Subsequently, however, it

regained its independence, through the Romans, and

under the name of Cherson or Chorson flourished

till a late period of the middle ages, and even over­

turned the Bosporan kingdom. (Const. Porphyr.

de Adm. Imp. c. 53.)

Leaving the Heracleotic Chersonese, we will now

proceed to describe the remainder of the coast of the

Tauric peninsula, which may be soon despatched, as

an account of its different cities is given in separate

articles. From the haven of Symbolon (Balaclava)

to Theodosia (Cnjj'a) the coast is correctly described

by Strabo as craggy, mountainous, and stormy, and

marked with many headlands (p. 309). The dis­

tance, however, which he assigns to this tract of

1000 stadia, or 125 miles, is rather too small. In

both the Periplus of the Euxine the distance given is

1320 stadia, but this must include all the indentures

of the coast. The most remarkable promontory in

this part was the Criu-metopon, or Ram's Head,

which has been variously identified. Some writers

have taken it for the promontory of Laspi, which is

ill reality the most southern point of the peninsula.

Some again have identified it with Ai Petri, and a

still greater number with the Aju-dngh. But the

account given by Arrian and the Anonymous agrees

better with Cape Aitliodor. These writers say that

the Ciiu-metopon lay 220 .stadia to the W. of Lam-

pas. (Arrian, Peripl, p. 20; Anon. Peripl. p. 6.)

Now Lampas is undoubtedly the present Bijuk

Lam pat, the distance between which and Cape Ai­

tliodor agrees very accurately with the preceding

measurement. Scymnus indeed (ii. 320, Gail)

states the distance at only 120 stadia; but this is

evidently an error, as it is too short by half even

for Ajn-du</!r. Cope Aitkodor is not much N. of

Lapsi, and from its position might easily have been

taken by the Greeks for the southernmost point of

the peninsula. (See Neumann, 451, sq.)

From the traces of Greek names, ruins, remains of

marble columns,&c, it may be inferred that the whole

of this tract was once in the hands of the Greeks.

Rut these relics probably belong to the Byzantine

times, since the older geographers mention only four

places on this part of the coast, namely, Cbarax,

Lagyra, Lampas. and Athenaeon.

To the E. of Theodosia the coast of the Euxine

trends into a large bay, which, approaching the Palus

Maeotis on the N., tonus an isthmus about 12 miles

broad, to the E. of which, as far as the Cimmerian

Bosporus, extends the Bosporan peninsula, or that

of Kcrtech, which swells out to double the breadth

of the isthmus. The western half of this peninsula

is flat; but the eastern portion rises into hills, which

surround the bay in which Panticapaeumwas situated.

It possessed several flourishing maritime towns, as

Cazeka and Cimmericum on the S. coast; Nympbaeon

Faritkapaeuin, the Bosporan capital, on the Cim­

merian Bosporus; with some others of less note, as

Myiinccium, Portlnuiun, and Herinisium. There

were also probably towns in the irterwr; W wr
