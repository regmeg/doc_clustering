THEODOSIO'POLIS (also called Arm), a town

in the SE. of Thrace, on the road from Cypsela to

Byzantium, a short distance to the E. of the source

of the river Melas. Ammianus (xxvii. 4. § L2) men­

tions it by the latter name as one of the two chief

towns of Europa, the designation in his time of thu

SE. division of Thrace. [J. R.]

THEODOSIO'POLIS (BeooWioi'iroAit, Procop

de Aed. iii. 5), a city in Armenia Major, founded by

Theodosius II. to keep the Armenians in subjection

It was enlarged by the emperor AnasUsius, and its;

fortifications ware much strengthened by Justinian.

(Procop. B. P. i. 10.) It lay S. of the Aruxcs and

42 stadia S. of the mountain in which the Euphrates

rises, the present Bingol. (Id. lb. 17; cf. Hitter,

ErdJc. x. p. 79, seq.) Tbeodosiopolis enjoyed an ex­

tensive commerce. (Const. Porphyr. de Adm. Imp.

45.) Some writers identify it with Arzervtmi

(Ritter, lb. pp. 80, 271, seq.; Zeune, p. 431); but

according to D'Anville (Oeogr. Anc. ii. p. 99, sq.)

it lay 35 miles E. of that place. (Cf. Chardin,

ii. p. 173, sq.; Hamilton, Asia Minor, $c. L p.

THEO'POLIS. This place in Gallia, with a

pure Greek name, was near Sisteron, in the depart­

ment of Baurt-A Ipei, on the left bank of the Dru-

eotia (Durance). An inscription cut on the slope

of a rock in honour of Dardanus, praefect of the

Practorium of Gallia in the time of Uonorius, and

in honour of his mother, informs us that they made

a road for this town by cutting both sides of the

mountains, and they gave it walls and gates. The

place is still called Thtoux, and there arc said to be

remains there. (D'Anville, Notice, &c ) [G. L.J

THERA (&fip*. Ion. erjpri: Elk. enpoioi:

Santorin), an island in the Aegacan sea, and the

chief of the Sporades, is described by Strabo as 200

stadia in circumference, opposite the Cretan island

of Dia, and 700 stadia from Crete itself. (Strab.

x. p. 484.) Pliny places Thera 25 Human miles

S. of Ios (iv. 12. s. 23). Thera is said to have

been formed by a clod of earth thrown from the ship

Arco, to have received the name of Calliste, when

it first emerged from the sea, and to have been first

inhabited by the Phoenicians, who were left there

by Cadmus. Eight geuerations afterwards it was

colonised by Lacedaemonians and Minyse under the

guidance of the Spartan Theras, the son of Autesion,

who gave his name to the island. (Herod, iv. 147,

seq.; Pind. Pyth. iv. 457; CaUin. ap. Strab. viii. p.

portance in history is owing to its being the mother-

city of Cyrene in Africa, which was founded by

Battus of Thera in B.C. 631. (Herod, iv. 150,

seq.) At this time Thera contained seven disliit ts
