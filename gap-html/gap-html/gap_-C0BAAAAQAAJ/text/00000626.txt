fib on the Bidaspes (Vipusa) (vii. 1. $ 40"). It is

clear from a comparison of the two names that they

refer to the same original Indian dynasty, who were

known by the name of the Pandavas, and who ap-

pear to have been extended very widely over India.

At the time of the invasion of Alexander, the district

in the Punjab belonged to king Poms. (Strab. xv.

the north of Palestine, called by Ptolemy and Hier-

ocles (U. cc.) a city of Phoenicia, situated upon

one of the sources of the Jordan, at the foot of .Mt

J\tnium, one of the branches of Lebanon. Mt

Panimn contained a cave sacred to Pan, whence it

derived its name. (Philostorg. vii. 7.) At this

spot Herod erc-etcd a temple in honour of Augustus.

(Joseph. Ant. xv. 10. § 3. P. ./. i. 21. §3.) Paneas

w;is supposed by many to have been the town of

Laish, afterwards called Dan; but Eusebius and

Jer-'ine state that they were separate cities, distant

4 miles from each other. (Reland, Palaestina,

p. IH8, seq.) Paneas was rebuilt by Philip the

Tetrarch, who called it Caesareia in honour of the

Roman envjierur. and pave it the surname of Philippi

to distinguish it from the other Caesareia in Pales­

tine. (Joseph. Ant. xviii. 2. § 3, B. ./. ii. 9. § 1.)

It was subsequently called Neronias by Herod

Agrippa in honour of the emperor Nero. (Joseph.

Ant. xx. 8. § 4; Coins.) According to ecclesias­

tical tradition it was the residence of the women

diseased with an issue of blood. (MuttJi. ix. 20;

Euseb. //. K. vii. 18; Sozom. v. 21; Theoph.

Chronotjr. 41; Phot. cod. 271.) Under the

Christians Paneas became a bishopric. It is still

called Banias, and contains now only 150 houses,

(to the NE. side of the village tlie river, supposed to

he the principal source of the Jordan, issues from a

spacious cavern under a wall of rock. Around this

source are many hewn stones. In the face of the

perpendicular rock, directly over the cavern and in

oilier parts, several niches have l»een cut, apparently

to receive statues. Each of these niches had once

an inscription; and one of them, copied by liurek-

hardt, appear* to have been a dedication by a priest

of Pan. There can he no doubt that this cavern is

the cave of Pan mentioned above; and the hewn

stones around the spring may have belonged perhaps

to the temple of Augustus. This spring was con­

sidered by Josephus to be the outlet of a small hike

culled Phiala, situated 120 stadia from Paneas to­

wards Trachonitis or the NE. Respecting this lake
