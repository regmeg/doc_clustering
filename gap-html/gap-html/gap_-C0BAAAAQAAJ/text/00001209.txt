TELOS (T^A»j: ALTfttor: ZXfoi or i'wco-

w),a null rocky island in the Carpathian sea, be-

wrra Khodus and Ni*yrus, from the latter of which

» distance is only 60 stadia. Strabo (x. p. 488)

ncnbas it as long and high, and abounding in

one* fit for millstones. Its circumference was 80

*iia, and it contained a town of the same name, a  
"boar, hot springs, and a temple of Poseidon,

to attribute long given to it by Strabo is scarcely

ice from Telos. (Herod, vii. 153.) According;

- nv (iv. 69) the island was celebrated for a  
tc*es of ointment, and was in ancient times called

nuliata. (Steph. B. s. v. TtjAoj; Soy lax, p.

I; StmOam. Mar. Afatpii, § 272.) The town

I 'I s was situated on the north coast, and remains

a are still seen above the modern village of EpU-

pi. The houses, it appears, were all built in ter­

ras ruing above one another, and supported by

■■Tig wails of unhewn atone. The acropolis, of

urh likewise a few remains exist, was at the top,

;irb is now occupied by a mediaeval castle. In-

r.;<j.m» have been found in Telos in great num-

n, but, owing to the nature of the stone, many of

-n are now illegible. (Coinp. Roes, Jlellmica, i.

TE'MESA or TEMPSA (Tm«i and T«>K

Strab.; Ttniffm, Steph. li.; Te'u^a, Ptol.: Etiu Te-

/ifffaTor, Tempsanus), an ancient city on the W. coast

of Bruttium, a little to the N. of the Gulf of Hipjhf-

nium, or Golfo di Sta Eujemta. Strabo tells us

that it was originally an Ausonian city, but sub­

sequently occupied by a colony of Aetoliaus who had

accompanied Thoas to the Trojan War. (Strab. vi.

p. 255.) alany writers apjwar to have supposed

this to be the 1 • . • i mentioned by Homer m the

Odyssey on account of its mines of copper (Odygn. i.

184); and this view is adopted by Strabo; though

it is much more probable that the place alluded to

by the poet was Temesa in Cyprus, otherwise called

Tamasus. (Strab. Lc; Steph. It. t. v.; Sehol. ad

Horn. <>!■■<. I. c.) We have no account of Temesa

having received a Greek colony in historical times

though it M-ems to have become to a great extent

Hctlenised, like so many other cities in this part of

Italy. At one period, indeed, we learn that it was

conquered by the Locrians (about 480—460 B.C.);

but we know not how long it continued subject to

their rule, (Strab. lc.) Neither Scylax norScyninu*

Chius mention it among the Greek: cities in thiit

part of Italy; but Livy says expressly that it was a

Greek, city before it fell into the hands of the Brut-

tians (Liv. xxxiv. 45). That people apparently

made themselves masters of it at an early period ..i

their career, and it remained in their hands till the

whole country became subject to the dominijn of

Rome. (Strab. L c.) During the Second Punic War

it suffered severely at the hands,first of Hannibal.and

then of the Romans; but some years after the clone

of the war it was one of the places selected by the

Roman* fur the establishment of a colony, which was

sent thither at the same time with that to Crotona,

D. C. 194. (Liv. xxxiv. 45.) But this colony,

the members of which had the privileges! of Ro­

man citizens, does not appear to have been nu­

merous, and the town never rose to be a place of

importance. Its copper mines, which are alluded

to by several writers (Ovid, Mel. xv. 706; Stat. Silv.

i. 1. 42). had ceased to be productive in the days of

Strabo (Strab. vi. p. 256). The only mention of

Tempsa which occurs in Roman history is in connec­

tion with the great servile insurrection under Sfar-

tacus, when a remnant of the servile force seem to
