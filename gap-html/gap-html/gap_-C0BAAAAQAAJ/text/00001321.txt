TROICUS MONS (Jpvuibv Spot, Strab. xvii. p.

rMi9 ; Steph. B. f. v.; Tpuucov \l9ou loos, Ptol. iv.

5. § 27), was n long range of hills east of the Nile,

which threw out several abrupt spun into the Hep-

:uomi* of AegypL It stood in the parallel of

lierscleopolis, i. e. in Lat 310 N. From this calcareous

range was quarried, according to Strata, the stone

used in the construction of the Pyramids. [W. B. D.J

TBOJA. [luuMi Troas.]

TROPAEA AUGUSTI. [Mosokci Portus.]

TROPAEA DRUSI (Toowaia Apovoov), a

trophy erected on a hill on the banks of the Kibe

ir iMuus, to mark the point to which he had

■tranced in the north of Germany. (Dion Cass. It. 1;

Fine, nr. 12; Ptol. ii. 11. § 28, who speaks of it

is if it were a town.) [L. S.]

TROPAEA POMPEII (ri nojUwrrfVw rporoio,

x araOrjpora, Strab. iii. p. 160, iv. p. 178), a tro-

■ihy or monument erected by Pompey on the summit

>f the Pyrenees, recording tho subjugation of 876

Spanish cities. (Plin. iii. 3. a. 4, ir. 7. s. 27, xxxvii.

'. y. 6.) It stood at the spot named Summum

i'lrenaeum in the Jtin. Ant. (p. 397), and accord-

is to some on the boundary between Gaul and

Stain. [T. H. D.]

TROSMIS (Tpoofdt, Hierocl. p. 637; Tpicr^lr or

[>oi«plt, Ptol. iii. 10. § II), a town of some ira-

Mrtance in Lower Moeaia, on the Danube, where,

icnirding to the /tin. Ant. (p. 225), the Legio I.

lovia had its head quarters, though the Arofc Imp.

•- 2H) more correctly mentions the Legio n. Her-

nl'a. Lapie identifies it with ilatckm. (Cf.

Jvid, ex Pont. iv. 9, t. 79.) [T. H. D.J

TRO'SSULUM, a town of Etruria, which, accord-

ng t > a story current among the Romans, was taken

ij a body of cavalry alone, unsupported by infantry;

in exploit thought to be so singular, that the Roman

.aifbts were for some time called Trossuli on ac­

cent of it. (Plin. xxxiii. 2. a. 9; Festus, «. v. Tros-

lali, p. 367.) No other mention is found of it; and

t was probably a small place which had disappeared

n the time or. the geographers, but Pliny tells us

L <-.) that it was situated 9 miles from Volsinii, on

be side towards Rome. It is said that tho name

ras still retained by a place called Trosso or V'ado

H Trotso, about 2 miles from Monte Kiascone, as

tie as the 17th century, bnt all trace of it is now

-t, (Holsten. Not. ad Cluvtr. p. 67; Dennis's  
.(rano, ml. i. p. 517.) [E. H. B.]

I RUKNTUM. [CASTRt'H Truentinuji.J

TBUENTUS or TRUENTl'NUS (Tpoutvrirot:

rrtmtu), a considerable river of Picenutn, which

isea in the Apennines above Amatrice, flows under

'e walls of Aecoli (Ascnlum), and falls into the

olriajic about 5 miles S. of S. Benedetto. It gave

ame to a town which was situated at its mouth,

ad is called by Pliny Truentum, but more com­

ply Castkcm Trcbktimum. Though one of the

»w considerable of the rivers of Picenum, the

rtientue haa very much the character of a moun-

un torrent, and is only navigable for about 5 miles

«w its mouth. (Strab. v. p. 241; Plin. iii. 13. s. 18;

lei. » 4. § 6; Ptol. iii. 1. § 21.) [E. H. 1).]

TKUTULENSIS POUTUS. [Kiti i-ue.]

TRYBACTRA (TpvfdVrpo, Ptol. vi. 12. § 6), a

««ce to the MV. of Alexandreia Oxiana, probably

rpnsented by the present Bokhara. [V.]

ITAEijIS (Joimau, PloL ii. 3 § 13), a town

on the E. coast of Britannia Barbara, which stood on

an estuarr of the same name (Ptol. iA. § 5), now

the Murray Krith. [T. H. D.]

TUATI VETUS, a town in Hi«pania Bsetica,

belonging to the jurisdiction of Corduba. (Plin. iii.

3. s. 3.) Ukert (ii. pt. i. p. 370) is of opinion that it

should be call Tucci Veins. [T\ H. D.]

TUBANTES or TUBAXTII (ToWojtoi or

Toutdmoi), a German tribe which was allied with

the Chernsci, and seems originally to have dwelt

between the Rhine and Yessel; but in the time of

Germanicus they appear in the country south of the

Lippe, that is. the district previously occupied by

theSigambri (Tac. Ann. i. 51, xiii. 55, foil.) They

seem to have followed the Cherusri still farther to

the sonth-east, as Ptolemy (ii. 11. § 23) places

them on the south of the Chatti, near the Thurhtyer

Wald, between the rivers f'ulda and Werra (Conip.

Tac. derm. 36). In the end we find them again

as a member of the confederacy of the Franks.

(Nazarius, Paney. Const. 18.) The name Subattii

in Strata (vii. p. 292) is probably only an error of

the transcriber, whence Kramer has changed it into

TovMttioi. (Wilhelm. Germanien, p. 130.) [L.S.]

TUBUCCI, a place in Lusitania between Scala-

bris and Mundobriga. (/tin. Ant p. 420.) Pro­

bably Abrantes. [T. H. D.]

TUBUIiBO MAJUS and MINUS (eoirfovoetf,

Ptol. iv. 3. § 35), two neighbouring towns in the in­

terior of Byzacium. The latter is still called Tebourbti;

the former is variously identified with Tubersule and

Zayhouan. Pliny (v. 4. s. 4) writes the name Tubur-

bis. (/(in. Ant. pp. 44, 48; Tab. Peut.) [T.U.D.]

TUBUSUPTUS (TooSowrowrroT, TooeTowoinr-

wor, or Tovtovoimtos, Ptol. iv. 2. § 31, viii. 13. §

12), a town of Mauretania Caesaricnsis, 18 miles

SE. of Saldae. (//in. Ant. p. 32.) According to

Atnmianus Marcellinus it was situated close to

Mons Ferratus (xxix. 5. § 11). From Pliny (v. 2.

s. 1) we learn that it was a Roman colony since the

time of Augustus. It was once a place of soma

importance, but afterwards declined, thoagh even at

a late jeriod it seems tn have had a Roman garrison

(\ot. Imp., where it is called Tubusubdus). Va­

riously identified with Bury, Bordj, Ticla, and a

place on the Djtbtl A/rovn. [T. H. D.]

TUCABA (TowoSa, Ptol. iv. 6. § 25). a place

in the interior of Libya. [T. IL D.]

TUCCA (Towcita, Ptol. iv. 2. § 28). 1. A

town of Manretania Caesariensrs. Ptolemy places

it in the interior; but according to Pliny (v. 2. s.

1) it was on the sea, at the mouth of the river

Ampsaga. (Cf. Tab. Peut.)

2. A town in the district of Byzaciom in Africa

Proper. (Ptol. iv. 3. § 32.) From inscriptions

found in a village still called Dugya it may be in­

ferred that the place should be more correctly railed

Tugga. According to the Itm.Ant. (pp. 47, 49, 51)

it lay 50 miles N. of Sufetula, the modem Sbaitha

or SfaiUa, and also bore the name of Terebentina or

Terebinthina, probably from its being situated in a

neighbourhood abounding with the Terebinth tree.

Tucca was a fortified town. (Procop. de Aed. vi. 5.)

It is probably the same place called Tuccabori by

St. Angustin (adv. Vomit, vi. 24 ) (Cf. Weasel, ad

/fin. p. 48.)

3. A town of Numidia. (Ptol. iv. a §

29.) [T. H. D.]

TUCCI (Tomki, Ptol. ii. 4 § 11), a town of His-

pania Baetica, between Ilipla and Italira (Ititi.

Anl p. 432.) According to Pliny (iii. 3. s. 3) it
