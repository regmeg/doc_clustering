Indian nation (vi. 21 ; cf. Diod. xvii. 105), who

wore the same arms and dress as those people,

but differed from them in manners and institutions

(Ind. c. 23). According to the latter they were a

race living under their own laws (xv. p. 720), and

armed with javelins hardened at the point by fire

and poisoned (xv. p. 723). In another place Ar­

ORME'NIUM ('Opuevtov), a town of Thcssaly,

mentioned in the Catalogue of Ships along with

Hypcreia and Asterium as belonging to Kurvpylus

(Horn. II. ii. 734). It was said to have been founded

by Ormenus, the grandson of Aeolus, and was the

birthplace of Phoenix. (Demetr. Seepsius, ap. Strah.

ix. p. 438, seq.) Strabo identifies this town with

a place in Magnesia named Orminium, situated at

the foot of lit Pel ion, at the di-tance of 27 htadia

from Demetrias, on the road passing through loleoa,

which was 7 stadia frum Demetrias and 20 from

Orminium. (Strab. /. e.) Leake, however, observes

that the Ormenium of Homer can hardly have been

the same as the Orminium of Strabo, since it appears

from the situation of Asterium that Kurvpylus ruled

over the plains of Thessahotis, which are watered by

the Apidanus and Knipeus. (Leake, Northern Greece,

vol. It. p. 434, seq.)

O'RNKAK fOpWai: Etk. 'Opvtdrr}s), a town in

the Argeia, mentioned in the Iliad (ii. 571), which

is said to have derived its name from Orneus, the

son of Erechtheus. Orneae retained its ancient Cy-

nurian inhabitants, when Argos was conquered by

the Dorians. It continued independent of Argos for

a long time; but it was finally conquered by the

Argives. who removed the Omcatae to their own

city. (Paus. ii. 25. § 6, viii. 27. § 1.) Thucy-

dides mentions (v. 67) the Orneatae and Cleon.iei

as allies (tTu/i/uaX01) of the Argives in B.C. 418;

and the same historian relates (vi. 7) that Orneae

was destroyed by the Argives in b. c. 416. (Comp.

Diod. xii. 81.) It might therefore be inferred that

the destruction of Orneae by the Argives in b. c.

416 is the event referred to by Pausanias. But

MiiJler concludes from a well-known passage of Hero­

dotus (viii. 73) that Orneae had been conquered by

Argos long before; that its inhabitants were reduced

to the condition of Perioeci; and that all the Perioeci

in the Argeia were called Orneatae from this place.

But the Orneatae mentioned by Thucydides could

not have been Perioeci, since they are called allies;

and the passage of Herodotus does not require, and

in fact hardly admits of, Muller's interpretation.

■ The Cynurians," says Herodotus (/. <?.), "have

become Doricized by the Argives and by time, being

Orneatae and Perioeci." These words would teem
