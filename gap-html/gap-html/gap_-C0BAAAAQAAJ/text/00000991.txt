The Santones gave name to that division of

France before the revolution which was named

SmUongt, the chief part of which is included in

the French department of Charente Injeriwre.

The coast of the territory of the Santones is low

and marshy; the interior is generally level and fer­

tile. D'Anville supposed that the territory of the

Santones comprehended the diocese of Sainta, and

the small province of Aunts on the north-west.

The wormwood of this country is spoken of by

various writers, Pliny (xxvii. 38), and Martial

(Ep. ix. 95): —

"Santonica medicata dedit mihi pocula virga."

Martial (xiv. 128) and Juvenal (viii. 145) men­

tion a "cucullus" with the name "Santonicus."

It appears that some thick coarse woollen cloths

were imported from Gallia into Italy.

Havercamp in his edition of Orosius (vi. 7) give*

a coin with the name " Arivos," and on the other

side the legend "Santonos" in Roman capitals with

the figure of a horse in action. He gives also

another coin with the same legend; and a third

with the abbreviated name "Sant" and the name

of " Q. Doci ' on it. [G. L.]

SA'NTONUM PORTUS (2oit«W Mmi»). Pto­

lemy in his description of the coast of Celto^alatia

Aquitania (ii. 7. § 1) proceeds from south to north.

Next to the outlets of the Garonne he places Santo-

num Port us, and next to it Santonuin Proinontorium

(ZavTOwr ixpor). The outlet of the river Canen-

telus is placed north of the proinontorium. The Ca-

rantonus of Ausonius is certainly the Charente [Ca-

kamtonus] ; and Ptolemy's Canentelus is a different

river, or, if it is the same river, be has placed it wrong.

It is impossible to determine what ia the Santonuin

Portus of Ptolemy. If it is RocheUe, as Borne geo­

graphers maintain, and if Ptolemy's Canentelus is the

CAarente, he has placed their positions in wrong

order. It seems very unlikely that Ptolemy should

mention a river between the Garonne and Loire, and

not mention the Charente. The only other large river

between the Garonne and the Loire is the Sevre Nior-

iaue, which ia north of La KocheUe, and if Ptolemy's

Caneuteloa is the Setre, the Santonum Portus

might be LaRochelk. D'Anville supposes San­

tonum Portus to be the embouchure of the Seudrt,

which open* into the sea opposite the southern ex­

tremity of the Jtle cTOIeron ; bnt he does not un­

dertake to fix the position of the Santonum Promon-

torium. The latitudes of Ptolemy cannot be trusted,

and hi* geography of Gallia is full of errors. [G.L.]

SAOCE. [Samotbracb.]

SAO'CORAS (3o»ko»o», PtoL v. 18. § 3), a river

of Mesopotamia, mentioned by Ptolemy, which

appears to have had it* source in the M. Masiua

near Xisibis, and to have flowed to the SW. into the

Euphrates. There has been much dispute, as to

what river Ptolemy intended by this name, as at

present there is no stream existing which corresponds

with his description. Forbiger has conjectured with

some reason that it is the same as the Mascaa of

Xenophon (Auub. i. 5. § 4), which flowed about

35 paraaangs to the E. of the Chabora* (Khobar),

and surrounded the town of Corsote: Ptolemy would

seem to have confounded it with the Mygdonius.
