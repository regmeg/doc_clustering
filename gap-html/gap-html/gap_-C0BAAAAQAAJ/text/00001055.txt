!• Modern opinions vary respecting its site; but

the best geographers, as Rennell, D'Anville, and

Heeren, concur in placing it at the NW. angle of

the present empire of China. (See Yates, Tex-

trinum Antiq. p. 232, note). The name of Serica,

as a country, was not known before the first century

of our era, though there are earlier accounts of the

people called Seres. It seems highly improbable,

however, that they were known to Hecataeus, and

the passage on which that assumption is founded

occurs only in one MS. of Photius. They are first

mentioned by Ctesias (p. 371, n. 22, ed. Bahr);

but according to Mela (iii. 7) they were in his time

known to all the world by means of their commerce.

On the nothern borders of their territories were the

more eastern skirts of the mountains Annibi and

Auxacii (the Altai), which stretched S3 far as here

from Scythia. In the interior of the country were

the Montes Asmiraci, the western part of the Da-Uri

chain; and towards the southern borders the Casii

Montes (now Khara, in the desert of Gobi), together

with a southern branch called Tliagurus, which

trended towards the river Bautisus(//oan£-Ao.) On

the farther side of that river lay the Ottorocorras,

the most eastern branch of the Etnodi mountains,

called by Ptolemy (vi. 16. § 5) ii Xriputi Spr|.

Among the rivers of the country, the same author

(lb. § 3) names, in its northern part, the Oechardes

(probably the Selenga), and, in the S., the Bautes or

Bautisus (Iloang-hv), which flowed towards the

land of Sinae. Pliny, however (/. c), mentions se­

veral other rivers, which seem to have been coast

ones, as the Psitaras, Cambari, Lanos, and Alianos,

as well as the promontory of Cliryse and the bay of

Cyrnaba. Serica enjoyed a serene and excellent

climate, and possessed an abundance of cattle, trees,,

and fruits of all kinds (Alum. Marc, xxxiii. 6.

§ 64; Plin. I. «.). Its chief product, however, was

silk, with which the inhabitants carried on a very

profitable and most extensive commerce (Strab. xv.

p. 693; Arist. Hist. Nut. v. 19; Virg. Georo. ii. 121;

Plin. and Amm. II cc. &c). Pliny records (xi. 2!2.

s. 26), that a Greek woman of Cos, named Pam-

pbila, first invented the expedient of splitting these

substantial silken stuffs, and of manufacturing those

very fine and veil-like dresses which became so cele­

brated unde» the name of Coae vealcs. Both Serica

and its inhabitants are thought to have derived their

name from their staple product, since, as we learn

from Hesychius (s. v 2ijp<s), the insect, from the web

of which the brilliant stuff called holosericon was

prepared, was named Ser (2rjp). (Comp. Klaproth,

Sur Us Noms de la Chine in the Mem. re/, a I'Asie,

iii. p. 264; and Tableaux Hitt. d* I'Asie, pp. 57 and

68.) It has been doubled, however, from the appa­

rent improbability that any people should call them­

selves Seres, or silkworms, whether the name of Seres

was ever really borne by any nation; and it has been

conjectured that it was merely a mercantile appella­

tion by which the natives of the silk district were

known. (Latham, in Class. Mas. vol. iii. p. 43, seq.)

Lassen (/no". AIL i. p. 321) has produced from the

Mahabharnta, ii. 50. as the real names of the Seres,

those of Caka. Tukhara, and Kanka, who are re­

presented as bringing just the same goods to market

as are ascribed by Pliny (xxxiv. 14. s. 41) to the

Seres, namely, wool, skins, and silk. Yet, though

it may be allowed to bo improbable that a people

should have called themselves "Silkworms," yet it

seems hardly less so that such an appellation should

have been given them by foreigners, and that they

should have been known by it and no other far a
