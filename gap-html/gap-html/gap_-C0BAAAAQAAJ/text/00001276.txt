1190 THBOKL THRACIA.

Thrace now shared in the general fortunes of the

U'tinan world, on the division of which into the

Eastern and Western Empires, it was attached to the

former, being governed by the Vtcaritu T/tracia-

rnm, who was subordinate to the Praefecttts Prae-

torio Ovieutls. Its situation rendered it extremely

liable to the inroads of barbarians, and its history,

so far as it is known, is little else than a record of

war and devastation. The Goths made their first

appearance there in a. i>. 255; the emperor P rob us,

about A. i>. 280, established in it 100,000 Bastarnae.

In a. d. 314, and again in ,323, the emperor Licinius

was defeated at Hadrianople by Constantme, who,

in a. d. 334, settled a multitude of Sarmatians in

Thrace, which, in 376, received another accession to

its heterogeneous population, Valens having given

permission to the Goths to reside in it. This gave

rise to innumerable wars, the details of which are

recorded by Ammianus (lib. xxxi.). In 395 the de­

voted country was overrun by Alaric, and in 447 by

the more dreadful Attila. Through all these mis­

fortunes, however, Thrace remained in connection

with the Eastern Empire, the capital of which was

within its boundaries, until the year 1353, when the

Turks, who had crossed over into Europe in 1341,

obtained possession of the Thracian fortresses. Their

leader Amu rath conquered the whole country, except

Constantinople, and made Hadrianople his capita].

At length, in 1453. Constantinople itself was taken,

and the Turks have ever since; been the undisputed

lords of Thrace.
