1092 TAPROBAJTE. TAPROBAXE

by the Aethiopians, and, after a time, with one other

companion, placed in a boat and left to his fate.

After a long voyage, he came to an island, rich in

all kinds of natural productions and 5000 stadia

round (<TTpoyyv\r} p,ev vitapxovoT) Ty trx^part).

lambulus stayed thrre seven years, and thence went

to Pali both m, where tie was well received by the

king, who is said to have been <pi\4\\tjv (I)iad. ii. 55,

&c). That the details of this voyage are fabulous no

one can doubt, yet the narrative is probably founded

on tact, and points to an early intercourse between the

■hares of Eastern Africa and India.

The fullest and by far the most interesting account

of Ceylon, is that preserved by Cosmas Indicopteus-

tes, which was published by Montfaucon {Coll.

Nov. Pair. ii. p. 336). Cosmas, who flourished in

the reign of Justinian, about a.d. 535, states that

lie obtained his information from a Greek named So­

natina, whom he met at Adulis. According to this

writer, the Taprobane of the Greeks is the Sielediba of

the Hindus, an island lying beyond the Pepper Coast,

or Malabar, and having near it a great number of

small islands (i. e. the Maldives). He reckons it

aboui 900 miles in length and breadth, a measure

he deduces from a native measure called Gaudia

(still said to be known in the island, and the same

as the Tamil tialiguai, Vincent, ii. p. 506). There

were, at the time he received his information, two

kings in the island, one the possessor of the Hyacinth

(1. e. ot the mountain districts which abound in pre­

cious stones), and the other of the plain country and

coast, where in later times the Arabians, Portu­

guese, Dutch, and English, have in succession esta­

blished factories. A Christian church, he adds,

was established there lmhT)ixQ\)VTwv Tltpowv Xpia-

Tiafuf, with a priest and deacon ordained in Per­

sia. There is no doubt that these were Nestorians,

whose Catholicos resided at Ctesiphon, and who, on

the Malabar coast, are often called Christians of St.

Thomas. He determines the position of Sielediba,

by stating that it is as far from it to China, as from

the Persian Gulf to the island (p. 138). Again,

he says, which is less correct, that Sielediba is five

days' sail from the continent ; and that on the con­

tinent is a place named Marallo {Marawar .?), which

produces the pearl oysters; and adds, that the king

of Ceylon sells elephants for their height; and that

in India elephants are trained for war, while in

Africa they are captured for their ivory. Horses

imported from Persia pay no tax. It is remark­

able that this notice of the elephants is in strict

accordance with that of Aelian, who asserts that

they were bred in Ceylon and transported in

large native vessels to the opposite continent, and

sold to the king of Calingae {Hist. An. xxvi.

18). Pliny {I.e.), on the authority of Onesicri-

tus, affirms that larger and more warlike elephants

are reared in this island than anywhere else in India,

and that the hunting of them was a constant sport: and

Ptolemy places under the Alalca M. {Adams Peak)

his 4\«pdvT<»)v vo,ualt in the exact position in which

they were, till lately, most abundant (viL 4. § 8).

Tin* testimony of all modern travellers on the subject

of the Ceylon elephant is, that those bearing great

tusks, and therefore valuable for their ivory, are ex­

tremely rare in the island. (Compare also Dioiiys.

of tCpptvoi i\f<pavrts as the product of the island;

Cosmas concludes his remarkable story with a notice

of a conference between the king of Cala* i^i v

patrns. in which the latter convinced tit* ki-'btf
