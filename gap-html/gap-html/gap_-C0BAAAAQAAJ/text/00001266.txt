opal (pacderos, Plin. xxxvii. 40); the Thracia

gemma, one variety of which seems to resemble the

bloodstone (to. G8); a stone which burnt in water

(Id. xxxiii. 30); and nitre, which was found near

Philippi (Id. xxxi. 46). In addition to the.se, M.

Viquesnel mentions fine marble, which is quarried

from the mountains of Lidja (p. 200); excellent

iron, manufactured at Samakor (p. 209); alum,

produced at Chaphane (p. 213) ; and potter's clay,

in the district of Rhodope, used by the Turks in the

fabrication of earthenware- (p. 319). He states also

that Rhodope abounds in mineral waters (ii.)j and

that there are warm springs at Lidja (p. 212).

A few miscellaneous notes will conclude this part

of our subject.

The narrow portion of Thrace between the Kuxine,

Bosporus and Propontis, is sometimes called the

Delta (to Ac'Ato, Xen. Anab. vii. 1. § 33, 5. § 1).

Reference is several times made to violent natural

convulsions, which destroyed various Tliracian cities.

Thus Strabo (i. 59) says that it appeared that some

cities were swallowed up by a flood in Lake Bisto-

nis; and he (vii. p. 319), Pliny (iv. 18), and Mela

(ii. 2) speak of the destruction of Bizone, on the

Kuxine, by earthquakes.

Livy (xl. 22) describes the region between Mae-

rliea and the llaeums as without inhabitants (solitu-

dines).

Herodotus (vii. 109) speaks of a lake near Pi>ty-

rus (on the coast N. of Abdera), about 30 stadia in

circumference, abounding in fish, and extremely salt.

Thrace possessed two highroads, 11 both starting

from Byzantium ; the one (called the King's road,

from having been in [tart the march of Xerxes in his

invasion of Greece, Liv. xxxix. 27; Herod, vii. 115),

crossing the Hebrus and the Nestus, touching the

northern coast of the Aegean sea at Neapolis, a little

south of Philippi, then crowing the Strymon at Am-

phipolis, and stretching through Pella across Inner

Macedonia and Illyria to Dyrrhachium. The other

road took a more northerly course, passing along the

upper valley of the Hebrus from Adrianople to Phi-

lippopolis, then through Sardica {Sophia) and Nais-

sus (jVmcA), to the Danube near Belgrade, being the

highroad now followed from Constantinople to Bel­

grade." (Grote, vol. xii. p. 34, note.) Herodotus

(V. c.) remarks, with evidetttsurpri.se, that the King's

road had not, up to his time, been destroyed by the

Thracians, a circumstance which he seems to attri­

bute to the almost religious respect with which they

regarded the " great king." It may be safely in­

ferred that people who were considered to have done

something wonderful in abstaining from breaking up

a road, were not great makers or maintainers of high­

ways ; and it is clear from Livy's account of the

march of Manlius (xxxviii. 40, 41) along this very

road (afterwards called by the Romans, Via Egna-

tia, q. i\), that, although it was the principal line of

communication between Euroj* and A.-da, it was at

that time (b. c. 18S) in a very bad condition.

Prom this some conception may be formed of the

deplorable state in which the roads of the interior

and mountainous districts must have been, and in

which, indeed, they i>ti) 1 remain. (Viquesnel, p. 312.)

The Thracians no doubt were well aware that their

independence would soon be lost, if there were an

easy access for disciplined armies to every part of

their country. lSucIi paths as they possessed were

sutlicieni for their own purposes of depredation, of

ambush, and, when overpowered, of thght.
