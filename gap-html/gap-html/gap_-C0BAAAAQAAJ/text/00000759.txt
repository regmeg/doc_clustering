PSEUDO'STOMOS(VfuSo<rTOfu>r woto^i, Ptol.

India, which Ptolemy describes as flowing from Mt.

Bettigo near Coimbatore to the sea near Muziris

(Mangalor). It cannot with certainty be identified

with any existing river, especially as along that

coast, betwet-n lat. 10° and 15°, there are a great

number of streams which, flowing but a short dis­

tance from mountains which approach the sea, are

little better than torrents. [V.]

PSILE, a small island, forming one of a cluster,

off the coast of Ionia, opposite to Clazomenac. (Plin.

PSILLIS (1'fAAir), a small river on the coast of

Phrygia, flowing into the Euxine between Artane

and Calpe, and affording at its mouth a good road

for small vessels (Strab. xii. p. 543; Ptol. v. 1.

§ 5; Anonym. Peript. P. E. p. 2; Plin. vi. 1; Arrian,

Peripl. P. E. p. 13, where it is called Psilis; Mari-

cian, p. 69, where it is written Psiilius; comp. Steph.

B. i. v. 'Ao-Kayi'a.) [L. S.]

PSOPHIS (Yw?It: Elk. VcHpiSiot), a city in the

NW. extremity of Arcadia, bounded on the N. by

Arcadia, and on the W. by Elis. It was a very

ancient place. It is said to have been originally

called Erymanthus, and its territory to have been

ravaged by the Erymanthian boar. (Pans. viii. 24.

§ 2; Hecat. ap. Sleph. B. s. v. Yimpli; Apollod. ii.

5. § 4.) It afterwards received the name of Phegia or

Phegeia (4>tj7!o, 4>r^ytio), apparently from the oaks

(<p7ryo!), which are still found upon the site of the

town; though the ancients, as usual, derived the

name from an eponymous founder, Phegeus. (Steph.

B. «. rt>. *7(7fia, Vuxpls; Paus. /. c.) It was called

Psophis by Echcphron and Promachus, Bons of Her­

cules, who are said to have come from Sicily and

given to the town this name after their mother

Psophis. (Paus. /. c.) Psophis, while still called

Phegia, was celebrated as the residence of Alcmaeon,

who fled thither from Argos, after slaying his mother,

and married Alphesiboea, the daughter of Phegeus.

(Paus. viii. 24. § 8; Diet, of Bioijr. s. v. Alcmaeon.)

In consequence of their connection with Alcmaeon,

the Psophidii took part in the second expedition

against Thebes, and refused to join the other Greeks

in the Trojan War. (Paus. viii. 24. § 10.)

P.-ophis is rarely mentioned in history. In B. c.

219 it was in possession of the Eleians, and was

taken by Philip, king of Macedonia, who was then

in alliance with the Achaeans. In narrating this

event Polybius gives an accurate description of the

town. "Psophis," he says,u is confessedly an ancient

foundation of the Arcadians in the district Azanis.

It is situated in the central parts of Peloponnesus,

but in the western corner of Arcadia, and adjoining

the Achaeans dwelling furthest towards the west.

It also overhangs conveniently the country of the

Kleians, with whom the city was then in close

alliance. Philip marched thither in three days from

Caphyae, and encamped upon the hills opposite to

the city, where he could safely have a view of the

whole city and the surrounding places. When the

king observed the strength of the place, he was at a
