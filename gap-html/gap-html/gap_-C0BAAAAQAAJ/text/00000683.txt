I '55, was Uw first who gare any account of it: it

**» rohsequrntly visited and described by Gel],  
Udeefl, aad others; and in 1812 the whole temple

was very carefully examined by a body of artists

tM scholars, who cleared away the ruins of the

i-Li. and thus became acquainted with the exact

I rsi u( the interior of the building. The results of

i are given by Stackelberg, Per Apollo-

u m Arkadien, Rom. 1826. The

Baple was a peripteral building of the Doric order.

rW stoas of which it is built is a hard yellowish-

limestone, susceptible of a high polish. It

«-s nearly north and south, was originally about

:5 feet in length and 48 in breadth, and had IS

i:jnm on either aide, and 6 on either front. There

-TV aho 2 columns in the pronaos and 2 in the pog­  
rom; aw that the total number in the peristyle was

x which 36 are standing. The cella was too

straw lo allow of interior rows of columns as in the

v-tinnon; bat on either side of the cella five fluted

■ »: wmi-coluxnn* projected from the walls, which

■ :;»rred the timbers of the hypaethron. The frieze

as a as the borders of Catacecaumene, remarks

(Tac A ana. ii. 47.) But in the midst

assBCaas Christianity flourished at l'hila-

aa early period, as is attested by the bonk

. — (ai. 7). Tlx town, which is men-

tioned also by Ptolemy (v. 2. § 17) and Hierocles

(p. 669), gallantly defended itself against the Turks

on more than one occasion, until at length it wits

conquered by Bajazid in a. d. 1390. (G. Pachym.

p. 290; Mich. Due. p. 70; Chalcond. p. 33.) It

now bears the name A lluhsher, but is a mean though

considerable town. Many parts of its ancient walls

are still standing, and its ruined churches amount

to about twenty-four. (Chandler, Traccit, p. 310,

foil.; Richter, Wallfahrtm, p. 513, foil.)

2. A town in the interior of Cilicia Aspera, on

the river Calycadnus. above Aphrodisias. (Ptol. v.

8. § 5; Hierocl. p. 710, who mentions it among the

episcopal sees of Isauria.) Beaufort (Karamania,

p. 223) supposes the site to be represented by the

town of Stout or Mood, which Leake regards as the

site once occupied by Claudiupolis (Ana Minor,

p. 17). [L.S.]

3. A town of Palestine in the district of Peraea,

east of Jordan, near the river Jabbok, was the

later name of Rabbath-Ammon, sometimes called

Kabbah only, the ancient capital of the Ammo­

nites. (Deut. iii. 11 ; Josh, xiii. 25.) It was

besieged by Juab and taken by David. (2 Sam.

xi. 1, xii. 26—31; 1 Chron. xx. 1.) It recovered

itd independence at a later period, and we find the

prophets denouncing its destruction. (Jer. xlix. 3;

Ezek. xxv, 5.) Subsequently, when this part of

Palestine was subject to Aegypt, the city was re­

stored by Ptolemy Philadelphus, who gave it the

name of Philadelphia. (Steph. B. $. v.; I.. -• b.

Onom. $ v. 'Pdpa$, 'A/i/iaV.) Stephanus says that

it was originally called Ammana, afterwards Astarte,

and lastly Philadelpheia. It is frequently mentioned

under its new name by Josephus (/?. J. i. 6. § 3,

L 19. § 5, ii. 18. § 1), and also by Ptolemv (t. 17.

§ 23), Pliny (v. 18. s. 16), Hierocles (p. 722), and

upon coins. (Eckhel, vol. iii. p. 351.) The old

name, however, did not go out of use, for Poly-

bius speaks of the city tinder the name of Kabbata-

mana ('PaGGardfiava, v. 71); and the ruins are

now called Amman, a name which they also bore in

the time of Abulfeda. {Tab. Syr. p. 91.) Burck-

hardt has given a description of these ruins, with a

plan. The most important are the remains of a

Large theatre. There are also remains of several

temples, some of the columns being three feet and a

half in diameter. A river flows through the ruins of

the town, (liurckhardt, Syria, p. 357.)

PHILAE (+iAaf. Strab. i. p. 40, xvii. pp. 803,

818, 820; Diod. i. 22; Ptol. iv. 5. § 74; Sem-c.

Nat. iv. 1; Plin. v. 9. s. 10), was, as the

number of the word both in the Greek and Latin

denotes, the appellation of two small islands situated

in lat, 24° N., just above the cataract of Syene.

Groskurd (Strab. vol. iii. p. 399) computes the dis­

tance between these islands and Syene at about

6£ miles. Philae proper, although the smaller, is,

from its numerous and picturesque ruins, the more

interesting of the two. It is not more than 1250

English feet, or rather less than a quarter of a mile,

long, and about 400 feet broad. It is composed of

Syenite stone: its sides are steep and perhaps

escarjicd by the hand of man, and on their summit*

was built a lofty wall encompassing the island. For

Philae, being accounted one of the burying-places of

Osiris, was held in high reverence both by the

Aegyptians to the N. and the Aethiopians to tha

S.: and it was deemed profane for any tut priests

to dwell therein, and was accordingly sequestered

and denominated "the unapproachable" (&6aTurB
