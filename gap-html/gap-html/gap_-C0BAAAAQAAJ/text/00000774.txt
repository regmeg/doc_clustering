and Crcscentino, near the confluence of tlic /Mrn

fin I tea with tlie /■*«,• but the CNiict site has not

been determined. Though the name is not men­

tioned by any of the, geographers, it would seem

to have been in the later a^es of tlie Km pi re a place

or station of importance, as we learn from the

Notitia that a body of troops (Sarmatae Gentiles)

was permanent I v stationed there. (A of it, Jjit/n.

QrADHllJt'RGirM. Ammiamis Marcellinns

(xviii. 2) mentions Quadriburtrmm anions the for­

tresses on the Rhine which Julian repaired: '*Civi-

tates neenpatae sunt sept em, Castra Herculis, I

(Juadribiii'L'ium, TriceMinae, Novesium, Bonna, An-

tiinnacum et Bincio.'' There is however some cor- I

ruption in the passage (note of Lindeiibros). 'J'he j

places seem to be mentioned in order from north to

south. D'Anville conjectures that Quadribursrium ,

is the same place as Burpnatium [BuitciNA- i

Gallten, p. 52S.) (tther ge<»p aphcRs conjecture'

QUAKTENSIS U M TS, a place mentioned in tlie

Not. Imp. as under the command of the governor of

Bel^ica Secunda: " Piaefectus classis Sambricae in

loco (Juartensi sive Hornensi." Tlie ])]:ice .-coins to

he (Ittarte on the Sambre, which keeps the ancient

name. The word Qwtrff indicates a distance of iv.

from some principal place, it beinj; usual for chief

towns to reckon di.-tanrcs alone the roads whit

led from them to the limits of their territory. Thi

principal place to which Quartensis belonged was

Bai::u'iim {Havai), and the distance frum Quart?

to liurni is four Gallic leagues. The ereat Roman

mad from Duroeortorum (AWj/w) to Burai passed

by UmtrU. "ijnartensi.-," is the adjective of a

form "Quartus"' or "Quarta," and t^uarta occurs

in an old record of the year 1125, "Altare de

Quarta supra Simbram," which is the cliurch of

Quart,'. [G.L.]

its position, and the name is not elsewhere mentioned;

indeed, it seems certain that the place was not in

existence at a later period. It is undoubtedly erro­

neous to connect (as Gel! has d>>nc) the name of tlie

Porta Quer juelulana at Koine with this city (Becker,

HaiuUiHch, vol. i. p. 170); and we arc absolutely in

the dark as to its position. It has been placed by

Gell and Xibby at a place called Corcollo, about

;i miles NIC. of Gabii and the same distance from

Hadrian's villa near Tiroli; but this is a mere con­

jecture. (Gell, Top. of Rome, p. ,169; Nibby,
