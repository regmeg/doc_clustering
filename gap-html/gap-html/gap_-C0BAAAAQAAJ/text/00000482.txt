394 NACOLEIA. NABATAEI.

habited the land of Edom, commonly known ns

Idumaen, and intimate that there was no connection

whatever lielween the Idumaeans ot' I'etra in the

Augustine period, and the children of Esau ; they

were, in fact, Nabatacans, and therefore, according

to Joseph uh and other ancient authorities, Ishmaelite

Arabs. How or when they had dispossessed the

Edomites dues not ap|>ear in history, nor what had

heroine uf the reninant of the Edomites. (Hubirw.n,

I'/ih. U'-s. vol. ii. pp. 5"j9.) But while Judas

Maeeahaeus was on terms of friendship with the

Nabataei, he was carrying on a war <>f extcrniination

against the Edomites. (Joseph. Ant. xii 8. § 1;

1 Marcttb. v. 3.) It is worthy of remark, however,

that tin- Idumaeans with whom Hyrcauus was in

alliance, over whom Arct.is reigned, and from whom

Herod way sprung, are expressly said to be Naba-

taeans (Ant. xiv. 2. § 3, 3. 4), whose alli­

ance was refused by l'oinpoy, on account of their

inaptitude for war. And this identity is further

proved by Strabo, who writes that the Idumaeans and

tlie lake (Aspiialtides) wcupy tlie extreme west ( ?)

corner of Judaea :—"These Idumaeans an; Na-

bataeans ; but being expelled thence in a sedition,

they witlidrew to the Jews and embraced their ens.

totns." (xvi. p. TOO.) This recognition of the

Nnhataean origin of the later Idumaeans, prove*

that tin' name is to be regarded as a geographyal,

rather than as a genealogical designation. Pliny

(vi. 32) throws little li<j.ht upon the subject,

merely making the Nabataei contiguous to the

Scenite Aral>s, with whom tliey were more probably

identical, and stating that the ancients had placed

tlie Thimanaei next to them (i. e. on the E.); in

tlie place of whom he names several other tribes, as

the Tavcni, Suelleni, Arraeeni, &c. (/hit/.) But the

statement of Josephus that the Nabataei extended

from the Euphrates to the Red Sea, is confirmed by

the fact that tlie name is still to he found in both

those regions. Thus the name Nabnt is applied to

a marshy district, described by Golius as part

of the " palustria Chaldaeae," between Was it h ami

Basra, which was called " paludes Nabathaeorum,"

(Golius, cited by Forbter, tin*}, of Arabia, vol, i.

p. "214 n.*), while at the other extremity the name

Nabni is given to a town two days beyond (i. e.

south) of El-lliinra in the Ifeifjaz, by an Arabian

geographer (Siiouti, cited by Quatreinere, Mrmnirtt

rur tes Xabattens, p. 38), near where Jcbtl Xdbtt is

marked in modern maps. The existence of this name

in this locality is regard'd by M. Quatrcinere as an

additional argument for the identity of El-llaura with

EcuceCome, proving that the country of the Nabataei

did actually extend so tar south. The fact of the origin

of the Nabataeans from Nebaioth the son of Ishmael,

resting as it does on the respectable authority of

Josephus, followetl as lie is by S. Jerome (t'luaest.

Htbr. in C'"t)rs. torn. ii. p. 530), and all subsequent

writers in the western world, lias been called in

question by M. Quatremere in the Me'moire above

referred to; who maintains tlmt they are in no

sense Ishniaelitcs, nor connected by race with any

of tlie Arab families, but were Aramaeans, and

identical with the Chaldaeans. He cites a host of

ancient and most respectable native Arabic authors

in proof of this theory; according to whose state­

ments the name Nabats or Nabataeans designated

the primitive and indigenous population of Chaldaea

and the neighbouring provinces, probably tho>e whom

Knsebius designates Babylonians in contradistinction

from the Chaldaeans. They occupied the whole of

1 that country afterwards culled Irak-Ar.n\ in tlx

| most extended sense of that name, even anum>

bending several provinces beyond the Tigris; mil
