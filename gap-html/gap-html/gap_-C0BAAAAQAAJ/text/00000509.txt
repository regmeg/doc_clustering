M.M'A.MA, a mnnicipal town in Hispania Bae-

NESIO'TIS (Ni7ff.tiTis x*P*t P^oL v. 9. § 17),

of the river Rha,and occupied by the Asabi, Matkki,

and PHl'HUBOPHAOL [E. B. J.]

NESIS (AYrida), a small island on the coast of

Campania, between Puteoli and Neapolis, and di­

rectly opposite to the extremity of the ridge called

Mons Pausilypus (Seneca, Ep. 53). It may be con­

sidered as forming the eastern headland of the bay

of fiaiao or Puteoli, of which Cape Misenum is the

western limit. The island is of small extent, but

considerable elevation, and undoubtedly constituted

at a remote period one side of t he crater of a vol­

cano. This must, however, have been extinct before

the period of historical memory; but it appears that

even in the days of Statius ami Lucan it emitted

sulphureous and noxious vapours, which has long

ceased to be the case (Stat. Silv. ii. 2. 78; Lucan,

vi. 90). It was nevertheless, like the adjoining hill

of Pausilypus, a pleasant place of residence. Brutus

had a villa there, where he was visited by Cicero

shortly after the death of Caesar, and where they

conferred, together with CasMus and Libo, upon

their future plans (Cic. ad Alt. xvi. 1—4). Pliny

tells us that it wus famous for its asparagua, a

celebrity which it still retains (Plin. xix. 8. s.

42); but the wood which crowned it in the days

of Latins (>'('//'. iii. 1. 148), has long since disap­

peared, [e. a B ]

NESIS (N»j<rif, Arrian Peripl. p. 18), a small

river, 60 stadia from tlie Borgys, which discharges

itself into the Euxine by the Prom. Herculis, Cape

Cotutantiouski( Cape A dler of Gauttier's map), where

there is now a river called Mtzioumta. [~E. B. J.J

NESSON. [Nkhbonm Lacus.]

NESSO'NIS LACUS (»/ N«ff«.rl* X/iinj), a

lake of Pelasgiotis in Thessaly, lying east of La-

ris>a, now called Karatjair or Mavpok'tLtyij. In

summer it is only a marsh, and contains very little

water, but in winter it is filled by the overflowing

of the Peneius. When the basin is filled, its su­

perfluous waters are conducted by a channel into

the lake Boebeis, now called Karla. (Strab. ix.

p, 440 ; Leake, Northern Greece, vol. L p. 445,

vol. iv. p. 403.) Strabo regarded the lakes Net-

sonis and Boebeis as the remains of the great luko

which covered Thessaly, before the waters found an

outlet through the vale of Tempe to the sea; but he

is mistaken in saying that Nessonis is larger than

Boebeis. (Strab. ix. p. 430.) Nessonis received its

name from a town Neason, which is mentioned only

by Stephanos B. (•• r. Nc'trtTtvy).
