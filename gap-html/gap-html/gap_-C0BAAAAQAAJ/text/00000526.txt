The structure of this elevated chain, consisting of

the lofty groups of Sir Sernh, the freaked glacier of

Mnt Khun, the A U Tdgk, Sapdn, Xhartal, and

Darkish, Tdghs, winch are probably the highest

range of Taurus, rising above the line of perpetual

r- now (10,000 feet ?), remains yet undetermined.

Lime-tone and gypsum prevail, with basalt and other

volcanic rocks, beep valleys separate the parallel

ridges, and also break their continuity by occasional

jus^es from the N. to the S. sides. (Ainsworth,

K1SAEI CAM PI, plains of considerable extent

in the mountain district of Media, which were famous

for the production of a celebrated breed of horses.

According to Strabo, they were on the road of those

who travelled from Persisand Babylon in the direc­

tion of the Caspian Gates (xi. p. 529), and fed

50.000 brood inarcs for the royal stables, in another

pla< e, the same geographer states, that the Nisaean

h'U-se were reared in the plains of Armenia (xi. p.

53U), from which we inter that the plains them­

selves extended from Armenia southward through

Media. Again, in the Epitome of Strabo (iii. p.

536, ed. Kramer), the NUaean plain is stated to be

near the Caspian Gates, which lead into Parthia.

Tiie fact is, tlie district was not accurately defined.

Herodotus states that the place, from which the be>t

while hoi>es (which were reserved for the use of the

king) came, was a great plain in Media (vii. 40).

And the same view is taken by Eustatlnus in Ids

Commentary on Dionysius (v. 1017), and con­

firmed by the notice in Arriao's account of Alex­

ander's march (\ii. 13). Ainmianus, on the other

hand, states that the Nisaean hordes were reared in

the plains S. of M. Coronus (now Dtmawend). It

appears to have been the custom on the most solemn

occasions to sacrifice these horses to the sun (Phi-

lost r. Yit. A poll. i. 20); and it may be inferred

from Herodotus that they were also used to draw

the chariot of the Sun (vii. 40.) (Cf. also

Steph. \\. s. v.; Syncs. Eput. 40; Themist. Oral.

v. ]>. 72; Hcliodor. Aethtop. ix. p. 437; Suid.

s. V. Niiramf.) Colonel Kawlinson has examined

the whole of this geographical question, which is

much perplexed by the ignorance of the ancient

writers, with Ins usual ability; and has concluded

that the statements of Strabo are, on the whole,

the most trustworthy, while they are, in a great

degree, borne out by the existing character of the

country. He states that in the rich and ex­

tensive plains of Atishtar and Khawah lie recog­

nises the Nisaean plains, which were visited by

Alexander on his way from Baghistane to Susa and

Kebatana; and he thinks that the Nisaean horse

came originally from the Nisaea of Khurasan, which

is still famous for its Turkoman horses. Colonel

liawiinsun further believes that Herodotus, who was

imperfectly acquainted with Median geography,

traiiiderred the name Nisaea from Khorasan to

f Media, and hence was the cause of much of the con­

fusion which has arisen. Strabo, on the other hand,

describes correctly the great horse pastures as ex­

tending along the whole line of Media, from the road

which led from Babylon to the Caspian Gates to

that conducting from Babylon into Persia. The

whole of this long district, under the names of Kia-

teak, Alishtar, Huru, Sihrkhur, Bvthurud, Jips*

Idle, and Feridiin, is still famous for it* exerllwt

grazing and abundance of horses. Colonel Kaffini-

son, indeed, thinks that Strabo's epithet, tntfarn,

is u translation of Sildkhur, which means*** fail

manger.1' It was from this plain that Ptu*»

brought his supply of beasts of burthen to the ease

, of Antigonua (Dial, xix, 2) after the periloa* muck

\ of the Greeks across the mountains of the Cosmo*.

NIS1BIS (NoT(gt's). 1. A small place in Aroa,

mentioned by Ptolemy (v. 18. § 11) and Ammiwai

(xxiii. 6). It would appear to have been al tfe*

foot of the chain of the Parnpamisus. There *»

some grounds for supposing it the same place is in*

Nil of lsidorus [Nil j, and that tlie latter has aiv:#T-

gone a contraction similar to that of UiUtxa into R'a.

2. The chief city of Mygdonia, a bmall distnel a

the NE. end of Mesopotamia, about 200 miles S. if

Tigranocerta; it was situated in a v**ry rich i»i

fruitful country, and was long the centre cf a **rj

extensive trade, and the great northern en.p rr-^.

for the merchandise of the E. and W. It wa

situated on the small stream Mygdoniu* (Jalaa,

Oral. i. p. 27 ; Justin. Excerpt, e. LeyaL p. ITS),

and was distant about two days* journey frum tbfl

Tigris. (Procop. Bell. Pert. i. 11.) It t» 1

town of such great antiquity as to have b«otbna^

by some to have been one of the primeval cite: ^

Genesis, Accad. (Hteron. QnaesL in Gents, catv. x.

v. 10; and cf. Michael. Spiciltg. i. 226.) It is yt*

liable, therefore, that it existed long before thi

Greeks came into Mesopotamia; and that the *j*

dition that it was founded by the M.icedomarx,

called it Antiocheia Mycdoniae, ought rather tor-Hi?

to its rebuilding, or to some of the great ww-ta

erected there by some of the Seleucid pritcrt

(Strab. xvi. p. 747; Plut. LwulL c 32 : Psa

vi. 13. s. 16.) It is first mentioned id hk:*

(under its name of Antiocheia) in the march 4

Antiochus against the satrap Moloo (IVlyb. t. 51]

in the later wars between the Romans and Parthaa

it was constantly taken and retaken. Thus it »l

taken by Lucullus from the brother of T*ijth*<

after a long siege, which lasted the whole soicasl

(Dion Cass. xxxv. 6, 7). but, according to PluunH

towards the close of the autumn, without morfc rl

sistance from the enemy. (Plut I. c.) Araia I

was taken by the Romans under Trajan, and W

the cause of the title of " Parthkus,"* which tl

senate decreed to that emperor. (Dion Cass*. Iitt3

revolted, but who were subdued by the ara* i

remained the advanced outpost of the Rnrri

against the East, till it was surrendered by the IN

by Jovian, after the death of Julian. (Z».*vmi_ i
