SALENTI'NI or SALLENTIUI (both forms

seem to rest on good authority), (2aAfvriVoi), a

people of Southern Italy, who inhabited a part of

the peninsula which fonns the SE. extremity, or as

it is very often called the heel, of Italy. Their ter­

ritory was thus included in the region known to the

Greeks by the name of Iapygia, as well as in the

district called by the Romans Calabria. Strabo

remarks that the peninsula in question, which he

considers as bounded by a line drawn across from

Tarentum to Brundusium, was variously called Mes-

sapia, Iapygia, Calabria, and Salentina; but that

some writers established a distinction between the

names. (Strab. vi. p. 282.) There seems no doubt

that the names were frequently applied irregularly

and vaguely, but that there were in fact two distinct

tribes or races inhabiting the peninsula, the Salra-

tines and the Calabrians (Strab. vi. p. 277). of whom

the latter were commonly known to the Greeks aa

the Messapians [Cauaihha]. Both were, how­

ever, in all probability kindred races belonging to thai

great family of the Pelasgian stock. Tradition 1

sented the Salentines as of Cretan origin,

according to the habitual form of such

ascribed them to a Cretan colony nnder Id

after the Trojan War. (Strab. vi. p. 2S2:

Am. iii. 400; Fast. t. v. Salentini, p. 32*:

ap. Prob. ad Virg. Eel. vi. 31.) They tore

have inhabited the southern part of the xesx

extending from its southern extremity (sir r«
