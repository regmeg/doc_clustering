foundation of Aemona, at a distance of only 15

miles from Xauportu*, the latter place lost its for­

mer importance and decayed. During the insur­

rection of the Pamionian legions after the death of

Augustus, the town was plundered nnd destroyed.

( lac /. r.) The place is now called Ober-Lay-

barh; its Koman name Xaujvortus (from liaws and

porto) was connected with the story of the Argo­

nauts, who were believed on their r«turn to hare

saHed up the Ister to this place, ami thence to have

carried their ships on their shoulders across the

All- to tie- Adriatic. [L. S.]

NATS 1'ALO. a place on the south nvist of Gallia,

we^t of the Khodanus, mentioned in the Ora Mari­

time of Avienus (v. 613) —

Kt urbs."

The name Xaustalo looks like Greek, and if it is

genuine, it may he the name of some Greek settle­

ment along this coast. Nothing can he determined

as to the site of Xaustalo further than what Ukert

savs ((ialltt n, p. 41'2): it is somewhere between Crtte

and the h%me. [G. L.]

NAUSTATHMUS (Na&rraft/uir), a port-town

on the Kimne, in (he western part of Pontus, on a

salt lake connected with the sea, and 90 stadia to

the ea-t of the river Halys. (Arrian, Peripl. p. 16;

Mart ian. Heracl. p. 74; Anonym. PeripL p. 9;

Tab. Pent., where it is erroneously called Nautag-

nnis.) The l'eriplus of the Anonynms places it

only 40 stadia east of the mouth of the Hairs.

Coinp Hamilton {/ifsearches, i. p. 295), who has

identified the salt lake with the modern Ifamamli

(ililt-ul; but no remains of Naustathmus have been

bund. [L. S.]

NAl\STATIIMUS (NaiVrafljuos), an anchorage

on the coast of Cyrenaiea, 100 stadia from Apollonia.

(Sevlax, p. 45; SUuIbwm. i; 56; Strah. xvii. p. 8:i8;

Ptol iv. 4. § 5; Pomp. Mela, i. 8. § 2.) It is

identified with A7-////.?/, which Bceehey (Erped. to

the A* V*nist of Africa, p. 479) describes as a point

forming a bay in which larje shij<s might rind shel­

ter. The remains which have been found there

indicate an ancient site. (Coinp. Pacho, Voyage, p.

144 iiarth, Wanderungen, pp. 461, 495; Thrice,

Ur-a Pyrin* n*. p 103.). [E. B. J.]

XAUTACA (Nairrcuca, Arrian, A nab. iii. 28,

iv. IS), a town of Sogdiana, in the neighbourhood of

the Ox us (Jihori), on its eastern bank. It has been

conjectured by Professor Wilson that it may be the

sane as Nakshrb, (Ariana, p. 165.)

NAXOSor NAXUS (No£oy: Eth. Na^os: Capo

dl SrAiV»), an ancient city of Sicily, on the K. coast

of the island between Catana and Messana. It was

(situated on a low point of laud at the mouth of the

river Aeesines (Alcantara), and at the foot of the

hill on which was afterwards built the city of Tau-

romenium. All ancient writers agree in represent­

ing Naxos as the most ancient of all the Greek

colonies in Sicily; it was founded the year before

Syracuse, or B.C. 735, by a body of colonists from

Chalcis in Euhoea, with whom there was mingled,

according to Ephorus, a certain number of [on'ians.

The same writer represented Theories, or Thucles,

the leader of the colony and founder of the city, as

an Athenian by birth; but Thucydides takes no

notice of this, and describes the city as a purely

Chalcidic colony; and it seems certain that in Inter

times it was generally so regarded. (Time. vi. 3;

Ephor. ap. Strab. vi. p. 267; Scymn. Ch. 270—277;

Diod. xiv. 88. Concerning the date of its found-

atian see Clinton, F. //. vol. i. p. 164; Enseb. CVw

r»d 01. II. 1.) The memory of Xaxns as tb* «r-

liest of all the Greek settlements in Sicily J***

served by the dedication of an altar outside \U

town to Apollo Arehegetes. the divine patron awas

whose authority the colony had sailed; and it «ui

custom (still retained long after the de^tnu-.i'i <i

Naxos itself) that all Theori or envoys prcervh]

on sacred missions to Greece, or returning h*a

thence to Sicily, should offer sacrifice on lata x.'is

(Thuc. /. c.; Appian, B. C. v. 109.) It is liotii

that none of the writers above cited aiiud? !<■ ti

origin of the name oi X;ix»s; but there can he bnl

doubt that this was derived, as stated by Heii*oirt

(ap. St'ph. li. it. r. XaA*n), from the yr****

among the original settlers of a body of ctiiito'

from the island of that name.

The new colony must have b**en Bpeedih j .-■

by fresh settlers from Greece, as within mi

after its first otablishment the Chakidians *l

were able to send out a fresh colony, which focn4

the city of Leontini, B.C. 730; and this was sp«*Ji

followed by that of Catana. Theocles hin^K 1

came the Oekist, or reco^ni>ed founder, of the form

and Euarchus, probably a Chalcidic citizen, cf t

latter. (Thuc. /. c; Scymn, Ch. 2 83—2*6: N*

vi. p. 268.) Strabo and S-ymnus Chios tfcsb re?

sent Zancle also as a colony from Najt:«?, but n» ti

sion to this is found in Thucydides. But. as it i

certainly a C ha Iridic colony, it is probable that a

settlers from Naxos joined tho>c fn^m the pi'

country. (Strab. vi. p. 26S; Scymn. Ch. 286. Ti

vi. 4.) Callipolis also, a city of uncertain st>,

which ceased to exist at an early period, was •

lony of Naxos. (Strab. vi. p. 272; S-cvmn. Ch. L

But notwithstanding these evidences of i;s eariT:

sperity, we have very little information as la

early history of Naxos; and the tirst facts tr

mitted to us concerning it relate to ili^siers *M

sustained. Thus Her»nlotus tells us that it «as >j«

crates.despot of Gela. about u.c. 4ys—(iii

vii. 154); and his expressions would lead us u»

that it was reduced In him under f*rm»f A

jection. It ajipears to have afterwards so-r»-«d

passed under the authority of Gel^n of

and his brother Hieron, as we find it sub^X X

latter in n.c. 476. At that time Hieroo. witn a

to strengthen his own power, removed the ink***

of Naxos at the same time with those of CaV-ivj

settled them together at Leontini. while he n*:*

cilically mentioned during the revolutions tLs

sued in Sicily after the death of Hieron; b«:i

seems no doubt that the city was restored \

old Chalcidic citizens at the same time as. ti*.^w

hence we find, during the ensuing T^rvxi,

Chalcidic cities, Naxos, Leontini. and Catena,

rally united by the bonds of amity, and m»ir.s

a close alliance, as oprmsed to Syracuse aivi vh:

Doric cities of Sicily. (Id. xni. 56, xiv. 14,
