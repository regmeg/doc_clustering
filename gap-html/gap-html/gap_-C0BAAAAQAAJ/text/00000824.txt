736 ROMA. ROMA.

though soon to become formidable to its neighbours,

was not yet .secure from their attacks. The latter,

enclosing an area inure than twice as large as that

detent led by the Servian walls, betokened the capital

of a large .state, which, after becoming the mistress

of the world, was beginning to totter under the weight

of its own greatness, and found itself compelled to

report to the same means of defence which had pro­

tected its infancy — no longer, however, to ward off

the attacks of its immediate neighbours, but those of

the remotest tribes of Asia and Kurope. Thus the

history of tho city,during this jieriod of eight centu­

ries, reflects in some degree the history of the Bom in

people, and exhibits the varying fortunes of the

greatest of all human empires. Unfortunately, how­

ever, the materials even for a slight sketch of so

vast a subject and so long a period are scanty and

inadequate; nor, even were they more abundant,

would our present limits allow more than an attempt

to draw such an outline us may serve to illustrate

the topography of the city.

Tarquin the Frond, the last of the Roman kings,

seems to have effected little fur the city, except by

completing or improving the works of his prede­

cessors. Of these the most important was the

temple of the Capituline Jove, the description of

which will be found in the second part of this article.

The expulsion of the Tarquins (u. c. 510) restored

to the Human people the use of ttic Campus Martins.

This ground, which from the earliest times had

probably been sacred to Mars (Dionys. v. 13), had

been appropriated by the Tarquins, and at the time

of their expulsion was covered with the crops which

they had sown. The unholy nature of this property

prevented its distribution among the people, like

that uf the other royal goods. The corn was ordered

to be cut down and thruwn into the Tiber; and ac­

cording to the legend its quantity was so great that

it caused the island afterwards known as the Insula

Tiberina, <<r that of Aesculapius. (Liv. ii. 0; Dio­

nys. I.e. Hut. Pull 8.)

The defeat of the Ktruscans under Aruns, who

had esj>oused the royal cause, was, according to the

usual principle of the Romans of incorporating the

vanquished nations, the means of adding a fresh

supply of citizen?, as there will be occasion to relate

in another place.

We have little or nothing to record respecting the

history of the city from this period till its capture

by the Cauls n. c. 390. After the fatal battle at

the Allia, the Humans returned dispirited. The

city, together with the older inhabitants, was aban­

doned to its fate; many families escaped to Veii and

other neighbouring towns ; whilst the men of an

age to bear arms occupied the Capitol, which they

prepared todefeud. The flight of the Vestal virgins,

who succeeded in escaping to Caere, is connected with

a topographical legend. Being unable to carry away

all their sacred utensils, they buried some of them

in ca-ks (tloliotis), in a chapel near the house of the

Flanien O.uirhuhs ; whence the place, which seems

to have been near the Cloaca Maxima, in the Forum

Itoariutn, obtained the name of Doliola, and was

held so sacred that it was forbidden to spit upon it.

(Liv. v.40;Val. M ix. i. 1. § 10.) Varro, however

(/./v. v. § 157, Mull.), did not recognise this story,

but attributed the name either to some bones having

been deposited there, or to the burial at an earlier

period of some sacred objects belonging to Numa

l*ompilius.
