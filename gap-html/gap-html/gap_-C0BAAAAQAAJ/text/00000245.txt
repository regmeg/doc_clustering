LYCTUS, LYTTUS (Awrrot, Auttoj: Eth.

Awrnoi, Ai/ttioj, Ptol. iii. 17. § 10), one of the

most considerable cities in Crete, which appears in

the Homeric catalogue. (/£ ii. 647, xvii. 611.)

According to the Hesiodic Theogony (J'heog. 477),

Kbra gave birth to Zeus in a cave of Mt. Acgaeon,

war Lvctus. The inhabitants of this ancient Doric

city called themselves colonists of Sparta (Arist,

Pol ii. 7), and the worship of Apollo appears to

have prevailed there. (Callim. Hymn. Apoll. 33 j

comp. Miiller, Dorians, vol. i. pp. 141, 227, trans.)

In B. c. 344, I'balaecns the Pliocian assisted the

Cno-sians (gainst their neighbours the Lyctians,

ind took the city of Lvctus, from which he was

driven out by Archidamus, king of Sparta. (Diod.

ivi. 62.) Tlie Lyctians, at a still later period, were

Mipjgui in frequent hostilities with Cnossus, and

succeeded in creating a formidable party in the

island against that city. The Cnossians, taking

advantage of their absence on a distant expedition,

surprised Lyctus, and utterly destroyed it. The

citiwns, on "their return, abandoned it, and found

refuge at Lampa. Polybius (iv. 53, 54), on this

occasion, bears testimony to the high character of

the Lyctians, as compared with their countrymen.

They afterwards recovered their city by the aid of

tbe Gortynians, who gave them a place called Dia-

tonium, which they had taken from the Cnossians.

(Polyb. xxiiL 15, xiiv. 53.) Lyctus was sacked

by ifetellus at the Roman conquest (Liv. Epil.

xrix.; Flor. iii. 7), but was existing in the time of

Strafco (x. p. 479) at a distance of 80 stadia from

the Libyan sea. (Slrab. p. 476; comp. Steph. B.

a. v.; Scyl. p. 18; Plin. iv. 12; Hesyth. *. v. Kap-

rrpaitokis; Hierocl.) The Bite still bears the

mine of Lyrto, where ancient remains are now found.

(Pathley, Trav. vol. i. p. 269.) In the 16th cen­

tury, the Venetian MS. (J/tM. Clou. Ant. vol. ii.

p. 274) describes the walls of the ancient city, with

circular bastions, and other fortifications, as existing

upon a lofty mountain, nearly in the centre of the

bland. Numerous vestiges of ancient structures,

totnbs, and broken marbles, are seen, as well as an

immense arch of an aqueduct, by which the water

"as carried across a deep valley by means of a large

marble channel. The town of Aiuhkoe and the

hirtour of Chersoxesus are assigned to Lyctus.

Tbe type on its coins is usually an eagle flying,

.with the epigraph ATTTlilN. (Eckhel, vol. ii. p.316;

H5ck, Krtta, vol. i. pp. 13, 408, vol. ii. pp. 431,

446, vol. iiL pp. 430, 465, 508.) [E. B. J.]

LYCU'BIA (AvKovpla), a village in Arcadia,

which still retai a its ancient name, marked the

Iwradariei of the Plicncatae and Cleitorii. (Paus.

via. 19. § 4; Leake, Morea, vol. iii. p. 143;

l"**aos, voL I p. 198.)

LYCUS (AiS/cor), is the name of a great many

rivers, especially in Asia, and seems to have ori­

ginated in the impression made upon the mind of the

beholder by a torrent rushing down the side of a

hill, which suggested the idea of a wolf rushing at

his prey. The following rivers of this name occur

in Asia Minor: —

1. The Lycus of Bithynia: it flows in the east of

Bithynia in a western direction, and empties itself

into the Euxine a little to the south of Herat leia

Pontica, which was twenty stadia distant from it.

The breadth of the river is stated to have been two

plethra, and the plain near its mouth bore the name

of Campus Lycaeus. (Scylax, p. 34; Orph. Ar­

gon. 720; Arrian, Peripl. p. 14; Anonym. Peripl.

p. 3; Xcnopb. Anub. vi. 2. § 3; Ov. Epist. ex

Pont. x. 47; Memnon, ap. Phot. 51; Plin. vi. 1,

who erroneously states that Heme leia was situated

on (appositum) the river.)

2. The Lycus of Cilicia is mentioned only by

Pliny (v. 22) as flowing between the Pyramus and

Pinarus.

3. The Lycus of Lydia was a tributary of the

Hermua, flowing in a south-western direction by the

town of Thyatira: whether it emptied itself directly

into the Hermus, or only after its juncture with

the Hyllus, is uncertain. (Plin. v. 31; comp.

W'heler, vol. i. p. 253; P.Lucas, TroUieme Voy­

age, vol. i. p. 139, who, however, confounds tho

Lycus with the Hermns.)

4. The Lycus of Phrygia, now called Tchoruk-

Sii, is a tributary of the Maeander, which it joins

a few miles south of Tripoli*. It bad its sources in

the eastern parts of Mount Cadmus (Strab. xii.

p. 578), not tar from those of the Maeander itself,

and flowed in a western direction towards Colossae,

near which place it disappeared in a chasm of the

earth; after a distance of five stadia, however, its

waters reappeared, and, after flowing close by Lao-

diceia, it discharged itself into tho Maeander.

(Herod, vii. 30; Plin. v. 29; Ptol. v. 2. § 8;

Hamilton, Researches, vol. i. p. 508, &c, and

Journal of the Royal Geogr. Soc. vii. p. 60, who

re-discovered the chasm in which the Lycus disap­

pears, amid the ruins near Chonas.)

5. Pontus contained two rivers of this name: —

(re.) A tributary of the Iris in the west, is now called

Kulei Ilissar. It has its sources in the hills of

Lesser Armenia, and, after flowing for some time in

a western direction, it turns towardsthe north, pass­

ing through Nicopolis, and emptying itself into the

Iris at Magnopolis. The Lycus is almost as im­

portant a river as the Iris itself (Strab. xi. p. 529,

xii. pp. 547, 556; Plut Lucid. 15; Plin. vi.

3, 4; Ov. Epist. ex Pont. iv. 10, 47; Hierocl.

p. 703; Act. Martyr, vol. iii. Jul. p. 46). (6.) A

tributary of the Acampsis or Apsorrhos, in the east­

ern part of Pontus, and is believed to answer to the

modern Gorgoro. (Ptol. v. 6. § 7.)

6. According to Curtius (iii. 1), the river Mar-

syas, which flowed through the town of Celamae,

changed its name into Lycus at the point wheie it

rushed out of the f rtifications of the place, [L. S.J

LYCUS (Ai/'kov), a river of Assyria, also called

Zabatus. [Zabatus.]

LYCUS (AiSkos), a river of Syria, between an­

cient Byblus and Berytus. (Strab. xvi. p. 755;

Plin. v. 20.) Although both these geographers

mention the river Adonis as distinct from this, inoie

to the north, between Palae-Iiyblus and Byblus, the

two rivers have been sometimes confounded. Their
