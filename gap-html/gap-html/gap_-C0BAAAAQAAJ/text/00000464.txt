from Jovian. (Amm, Marc. xxv. 7. § 9, comp.

xxiii. 3. § 5; Le Beau, Bu.< Empire, vol. i. p. 380,

vol. iii. p. 161 ; Gibbou, cc.xiii.xxiv.). Its exact

position cannot be made out, thouel) it must have

been near Kurdhtdn. (Hitter, ErJkumle, vol. .s.

p. .sic.) [E.B.J.]

Ml'CHIRE'SIS (Muf yearns at. Mui/x^pi""'?,

Procop. B. 0. iv. 2, 15, 16), a canton of Lazica, po­

pulous and fertile: tlie vine, which does not grow

in tin* rest of Colchis, was found here. It. was

watered by the river Kiieon ('PeW). Archaenpolis,

its chief town, was the capital of Colchis, and a

place of considerable importance in the La/.ie war.

(Le Beau, Bas Empire, vol. ix. p. 217; Gibbon,

c. xlii ) [E. B. J.]

MUCRAE or NUCRAE (the reading is uncertain),

a town of Samnium, mentioned only by Silius Italieus

(viii. 5(16), the situation of which i^ whollv un­

known. [E. II. B.J

1IUCUNI. [MaUBETASIA.]

MUDUTTl. [Moputti.]

MUGILLA, an ancient city of Latiuni, mentioned

only by Dionysiua (viii. 36), who enumerates the

Mugilluni (MfvyiAaiVow) among the places conquered

by Coriolanns, at the head of the Yolscian army.

He there mentions them (as well as the Albietes. who

are equally unknown) between thecitizens of Pollusca

and Coriuli, and it is therefore probable that Mu-

gilla lay in the neighbourhood of thnse cities; but we

have no further clue to its site. The name dues not

again appear, even in Pliny's list of the extinct cities

of Latium; and we should be apt to suspect some

mistake, but that the cognomen of Mugillanus,

borne by one family of the Papirian Gens, seems to

confirm the correctness of the name. [E. H. B.]

MUICCRUM (MovTKOvpov), a place on the coast

of lllyricum, near Salona, which was taken for Totila,

king of the Goths, by llauf. (Procop. ii. 0. iii.35;

Le Beau, Bas Empire, vol. ix. p. 82.) [E. B. J-]

Ml'LELACHA, a town upon a promontory of

the same name on the W. eoa.-t of Africa (Polyb.

np. Plin. v. 1). now Afuleg Bu Stlham, the old

Mamora of the charts. (Comp. i.ondon Geog. Journ.

vol. vi. p. 302.) [E.B.J.]

MUIXCHA, a river of Mauretnnia, which Sallust

(Jug. 92, 110), Mela (i. 5. §§ 1, 5), and Pliny (v. 2)

assign as the boundary between the Mauri and Mas- |

saesyli, or the subjects of Boeehus and Jupiirtha.

As Strabo (xvii, pp. 827,829) makes the Mow>

cath (MoAox«W, MoKaxdO, Ptol. iv. 1. §7) serve

the same purpose, there can be no doubt that they

are one and the same river. The Malva (MaAoi'a,

Ptol. I. c.) of Pliny {I.e.), or the Muluwi, which

forms the frontier between Afarocco and Algeria, is

the same as the river which bounded the Moors from

the Numidians. This river, rising at or near the

S. extremity of the lower chain of Atlas, and flow­

ing through a diversified country, as yet almost

untrodden by Europeans, falls into the sea nearly in

the middle of the Gulf of Melilah of our charts,

MUNDA (MoiVoa). 1. An important town of

Hispania Baetiea, and a Roman co.ony belonging to

the con vent us of Astigi. (Strab. iii. p. 141 ; Plin.

iii. 1. s. ::.) Strabo (I.e.) says that it is 1400

stadia from Cartcia. It was celebrated on account

of two battles fought in its vicinity, the first in

B.C. 216. when Cn. Scipio defeated the Cartha­

ginians (Liv, xxiv. 42; Sil. Ital. iii. 400), and the

second in B.C. 45, when Julius Caesar gained a

victory over the sous of Poinpey. (Dion Cass.

xliii. 39; Auct. Bell. IIL*p. 30, seq.; Strak m.

pp. 141, 160; Flor. iv. 2; VaL Mas. iii. 6.) ll

was taken by one of Caesar's generals, and, icuwdiif;

to Pliny, from that time it ceased to exist, (ufvA

Munda cum Pompei lilio rapta," Plin. iii. 1.%.1)

But this cannot bo correct, as Strabo (L c.) describes

it as an important place in his time. It is u-iVaiit

identified with the village of Afonda, SW. <-f Malm;

but it has been pointed out that in the vicimty ttf u>

modern Month, there is no plain adapted fur a feU

of battle, and that the ancient city should pn-bi

be placed near Cordova. It has been supposed uut

the site of Munda is indicated by the remains <i

ancient walls and towers lying bftw^n Man><\

Alcaioiete, Esjnjo, and Bona. At all events tba

site agrees belter with the statement of Strata, tls*.

Munda is 1400 stadia from Carteia, for the distil

from the modern Monda to the latter place is uon*

400 stadia; and it is also more in accordance wvth

l'linv. who places Munda between Attubi and Ct»

(Forbiger, vol. iii. p 51.)

2. A town of the Celtibcri in Hisp*nis Tirrv

conciisis, probably near the frontiers of the Carj*

tani. (Liv. xl. 47.)

3. A river on the YV. coast of Lusitania, fiiiirj

into the sea between the Tagus and Unnoa,
