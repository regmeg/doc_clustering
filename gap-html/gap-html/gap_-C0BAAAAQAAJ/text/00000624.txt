PAMPHY'LIA (UaupvK'ta), a country on the

south coast of Asia .Minor, bordering in tiie west on

Lycia, in the north on Pisidiu, and in the east on

Cilicia. The country, consisting of only a narrow

.strip of cnast, forms an arch round the bay, which

is called after it the Paniphylius Sinus or the Pam-

phylium Maro. According to Pliny (v. 26) the

country was originally called Mopsopsia, from Mops us,

a leader of one of those bands of Greeks who after

the Trojan W ar are said to have settled in Pam-

phylia, Cilicia, and Syria. (Strab. xiv. p. COS; comp.

Scylax, p. 39; Ptol. v. 5; Dionys. Per. 850, &c;

Pomp. Mela, i- 14 : Staditum. Mar.May. § 194,&c;

Iticrocl. p. 079, &e.) Painphylia, according to Strabo,

extended from Olbi.i to Ptolemais, a line measuring

640 stadia, or about 18 geographical miles: the

breadth of the country, from the coast towards the

interior, was nowhere above a few miles. In later

times, however, the Romans applied the name Pam-

phylia in such a manner as to embrace Pisidia on

both sides of Mount Taurus, which does not nj pear

as a distinct province of the empire until the new

division under Constantine was made. This accounts

for the fact of Polybius (xxii. 27) doubting whether

Painphylia (in the Roman sense) was one of the

countries beyond or this side of Mount Taurus;

for Pisidia, in its n.irrower sense, is unquestionably

a country beyond Mount Taurus. (Comp. Strab.

xii. p. 570, xiv. p. 632, xv. p 6i*5.) In this latter

nenso Painphylia was separata! from Lycia by Monnt

Climax, and from Cilicia by the river Melas, and

accordingly embraced the districts called in modern

times Ttk'he and the coast district of Jtshil. But

these limits were not always strictly observed; for

Olbia anil Perge are described by some writers as

belonging to Lycia (Scylax. p. 39); while Ptolemais,

beyond the Melas, which is generally regarded as

belonging to Piimphylia, is assigned by some to Ci-

licia. The country of Painphylia is, on the whole,

very mountainous; for the ramifications of Mount

Taurus rise in some parts on the coast itself, and in

others at a distance of only a few miles from it.

There is only one great promontory on the coast, viz.

Leucotheum, or Leueolla. The principal rivets, all

of which discharge their waters into the Pamphylian

bay, are the Catahkhac li s, Ckstius, EritY-

mkhon, and Mklas, all of width are navigable.

The cast district between the Oestrus and Eury-

lned"n contains the lake Capri a, which is of con­

siderable extent.

The inhabitants of Painphylia, Pamphyli, that is,

n mixture uf various races, consisted of aborigines

mixed with Cilicians who hail immigrated: to these

were added bands of Greeks after the Trojan War,

and Liter (Jreek colonies. (Strab. I.e.; Eustath. ml

J)'um. Per. 854; Herod, vii. 91, viii. 6S; Pans. vii.

3. § 3; Appian, H. C. ii. 71. iv. 00; Liv. xliv. U.)

The Pamphylians (Pamphyli, Pamphylii, Udu<pv\oit

Tlafj.(t>vAioi), accordingly, were in those parts what

the Alemanni were in (lennaiiy, though the current

traditions related that they were all descended from

Pamphyle, a daughter of Khaeius and Manto (Steph.

Ii. s. v. na;oJ>iA.a). or from one Pamphylus (Eus­

tath. ad D'um. Per. I. r ). Others aLrain, though

without g<«od reason, derive the mime from xas and

ipi;\Aov, because the country was rich in wood. The

Pamphylians never acquired any gre.it power or ]*■-

litical importance; they shared the fate of all the

nations of Asia Minor, and in the war of Xerxes
