period of the empire Nicomedeia enjoyed the honour

of a Roman colony (Orelli, Inscript. No. 1060). The

city is also remarkable as being the native place of

Arrian, the historian of Alexander the Great, and as

the place where Hannibal put an end to his che­

quered life. Constantino breathed his last at his

villa Ancyron, near Nicomedeia (Cassiod. Chron.

Const.; Philostorg. ii. p. 484). The modern Itmid

still contains many interesting remains of antiquity,

7. § 11; N(m, Ptol. i. 17. § 12), one of the

"Runs" of Azania, on the £. coast of Africa, seven

(days' stations) in all. Passing the Noti Cornu of

Ptolemy (ELKhaU), the voyager arrived at the

"Strands" (aryiaAol), the Little and the Great,

extending six days according to the Periplus, eight

according to Ptolemy's authorities, though he would

reduce the distance to four natural days. The Little

Strand, which occurs first, is doubtless the Self

Tamil, or "Long Sword," of the Arab pilots, so

called from its curvature. The Great Strand is

probably the district now called Mtrit, "Dry

Desert." These have an extent of 300 miles. Next

comes the peopled shore where Ptolemy (i. 17. § 11)

places 3 towns, Essixa ("Eo-crii'a), the Sarapionis

Portus (Zopawitci'o! ofijuis). and Tosice or Nict,

the Nicon of the Periplus. These towns must lie

placed in the Bara Somauli, or the land of the

Somauli, or Shumdli, a mild people of pastoral ha­

bits, confined to the coast, which they occupy from

tho Red Sea to the river Juba. Tho "Port of Sa-

rapion" corresponds with Markah, while the

"Run of Nicon" agrees with the point called Torre

in Owen's map. (Narrative of Voyages to explore

the Shores of Africa, Arabia, and Madagascar,

performed in II. M. shijtt Leven and Barracouta,

London, 1833; comp. Cooley, Claudius IHolemy

and the Nile, p. 64.) [E. B. J.]

NICO'NIUM (NikoViok, Scylax, p. 29), a city of

European Sarmatia, which Strabo (vii. p. 306) places

at 160 stadia from the mouth of the Tyras, while

the anonymous Coast-describer (p. 9) fixes it at

300 stadia from the Isiacorum Portus, and 30

stadia from the Tyras on the coast. Stejihanus

of Byzantium (». t».) states that it was at the mouth

of the Ister, but for "Io-rpov, Tvpou should probably

bo read. Ptolemy (iii. 10. § 16) has removed it from

the coast, and placed it too far to the N. Its posi­

tion must be looked for near Ovidiopol. [E. B.J.]

NICO'POLIS (NikoVoAi! : Kth. NikowoMttii),

i.e. the "City of Victory." L In Asia. 1. A

town of Bithynia, on the coast of the Bosporus, a

few miles north of Chalcedon. (Plin. v. 43; Stepb.

B. ». ».)

2. A town in Cappadocia or Armenia Minor,

founded by Pompey on the spot where he had gained

his first decisive victory over Mithridate*. (Strab. xii.

p. 555; Appian, Mithrid. 101, 105; Dion Cass,

xxxv. 33; Caes. Bell. Alex. 36; Plin. vi. 10.) It

was situated in a valley of the river Lycus, a tribu­

tary of the Iris (Acta Martyr, torn. iii. Jul. p. 46),

at a distance of 100 miles to the north-west of Sa-

tala, and 98 to the north-east of Sebastia. It was

a populous town as early as the time of Strabo; but

during the last period of the Empire it appears to havo

suffered much, and its decayed walls were restored by

Justinian. (Procop. de Aed. iii. 4; comp. Ptol. v. 7.
