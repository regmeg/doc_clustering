I20C TICINUS. TIC1NU&

From this time Ticinum sank again into tlie con­

dition of an ordinary provincial town, which it lias

retained ever since. Before the close of the Lom­

bard period we find that it was already designated

by the name of Papia, from which its modern appel­

lation of Pavia is derived. Paulus Diaconus calls it

"Ticinus quae alio nomine Papia appeJlatur" (P.

Diac ii. 15); and the anonymous Geographer of

Ravenna gives the same double appellation (Geogr.

Ravenn. iv. 30). The most probable explanation of

this change of name is that when Ticinum became

admitted to the rights of a Roman municipium its

inhabitants were enrolled in the Papian tribe, a fact

which we learn from inscriptions (Gruter, Inscr.

p. 1093. 7; Murat. Inscr. p. 1087. 1, p. 1119. 4),

and that in consequence of this the city came to be

known as"Civitaa Papia," in contradistinction to

Mediolanum, which belonged to the Ufentine tribe.

(Aldini, Anttche Lapidi Ticinest, pp.43—60.)

The modern city of Pavia contains no remains of

antiquity except a few sarcophagi and inscriptions.

These confirm the municipal condition of the city

under the Roman Empire, but are not in themselves

of much interest. [E. II. B.]

TICINUS (TiKtvos: Ticiuo), a considerable river

of Northern Italy, and one of the most important

of the northern tributaries of the Pad us. It has its

sources among the high Alps, in the Mons Adula or

Mont St. Gethardj and, where it first emerges from

the Alpine valleys forms an extensive lake, called

the Lacus Vkkbakus or Logo Maggtore. Where

it issues from this again it is a deep, clear, and

rapid stream, and flows through the level plains of

Lombardy, with a course of above 60 miles, passing

under the walls of Ticinum (Pavia), and discharging

its waters into the Padus or Po, about 3 miles below

that city. (Strab. iv. p. 209, v. p. 217; Plin. ii.

103. s. 106, iii. 19. s. 23.) Throughout this

lower part of its course (from the Logo Maggtore

to the Po) it is navigable for vessels ot considerable

burden; but the extreme rapidity of the current

renders the navigation inconvenient if not dangerous,

lis banks are low and marshy, the river being

bordered on each side by a belt of thickets and

marshy woods. This character of its banks is

noticed by Chuulian (de VI. Com. lion. 194), while

Siiius Italicns alludes to the beautiful clearness of

its waters. (Sil. Ital. iv. 82.)

The Ticinus appears to have been recognised at

an early period as the boundary between the Insubrians

and their neighl»ours the Libieii and Laevi (Liv. v.

34, 35). From its geographical position it must

always have presented a formidable barrier to any

invader advancing into Italy after having crossed the

Cottian, Graian or Pennine Alps, and for this reason

its banks have been the scene of many successive

battles. Even in the first descent of the Gauls into

the plains of Northern Italy, we are told that they

defeated tho Etruscans in a battle near the river

Ticinus (Liv. v. 34). But much the most celebrated

of the contests which were fought on its banks was

that between Hannibal and P. Scipio in B.C. 218,

shortly after the descent of the Carthaginian general

into Italy. 'Die precise scene of this action cannot,

however, be determined; but it appears to have been

fought on the W. or right bank of the Ticinus, at a

short distance from the Padus, and probably not far

from the site of Ticinum or Pavia, Livy marks it

more distinctly as being within 5 miles of a place

called Victumvii ( ?); but as no other mention of this

obscure name occurs, this lends us no assistance.
