220 LUTETIA. LUSITANIA.

I.II'.M (Plin. I. e. Santartm, Florez, Etp. $. vol. xiii

p. 69, xiv. p. 171); Jkrabrioa, 32 M. P. (Ara-

Colic's, Campo Mayor, Lapie; the river Botloa pre­

serves the name); An VII. Arar, 12 M. P. (vid.

tup.) Matl'saro, 8 M. P., AiiEi.TKiiitM, 24 M P.

(it seems that these names are inverted, ami that

the latter is A Iter <la Onto, and the former Puente

do S<>ra); AitiTii'M I'liAKTORUM, 28 M. P.

(Salraticrra, or Benavente, both close together on

the left bank of the Tagus); Ol.lstl-o. 38 M. P.

5. From Emkrita to Oi.Intro, W. with n curve

to the S. (Itin. Ant. pp. 416—418): Evandkiana,

8 M. P. (EiW5>i«. Ptol. ii. 5. § 8): I)iro, 17

M. P.; Ai> Adrum Fli'mkx, 12 M. P.; Eiioka,

9 M. P. (Erora). Here is a difficulty: the last is

a well-known place, but the distance is evidently

much too small: and the various attempts made to

identify the intermediate positions rest on no sufficient

data. The alteration of Ad Adrum to Ad Anam

li is no sign in the MSS. to bear it out. It seems,

on the whole, most likely that the route intended is

that of the great road through Talticera la Htnl,

fiahjoz, and Elan*. From Kbora, it proceeds

thus:—Salacia, 44 M. P., surnamed Urbs 1m-

1'KRATokia. a municipium, with the Old Latin

Franchise (Alcaecr do Sal.; Plin. iv. 35, viii. 73;

Mela. iii. 1; Marc. Herac. p. 42; luscr. ap. Grutcr,

pp. 13, 1C; Florez, E*]t. S., vol xiii. p. 115, xiv.

p. 241); Maleckca, 26 M. P. (Marateca T);

Cakch.iana, 26 M. P. (Atpuilra, or Pinheiro, or

Seucola t); Catobrma, 8 M. P. (Cctobriga,

land at the mouth of the estuary of the Callipus,

Satin, near Setubal: Itesend. A ntiq. Lut. iv. p. 210;

Mentelle, p. 87); Etjl-ABoXA, 12 M. P. (Cotjna):

Olikipo, 12 M. P." The country S. of this mnd

was traversed by others, connecting Ebora with

Pax Jii.ia, nnd both with the Anas and the S

coast; namely: — 6. (Itin. Ant. pp. 426, 427.)

From Ehcris (<»pp. Ayttmonte) at the mouth of the

Anas, in Baetica, W. along the coast to Baiaa,

24 M. P. (Tacira) : Osmonoba. 16 M. P. (Ertoy,

N of Faro, by C. de S. Maria); thence the road

struck inland across the mountains of the Ouneus

(Alt/arle), and down the valley of the Callipus

l&ilo), to An.nsi, or Araki-Is, 60 M. P. (0a-

rique\ Salacia, 35 M. P. (vid. sup.), and Ebora,

44 M. P. (vvl. sup.). The course pursued from

KuoitA by Sp.ri'a, 14 M. P., FtXKs, 20 M. P., and

Aiucri, 25 M. P., to Pax Julia, 30 M. P.

(ftrjn), is so intricate as to prove an error in the

Itinerary, which commentators have sought in vain

to amend. 7. The direct road from Esiris to Pax

Jt'LIA is given thus (Itin. Ant p. 431):—Mth-

tilis. M. P. 40 (Mertoli); Pax Jii.ia, 36 M.- P.

8. A direct road from Salacia to OssoxniiA is

also mentioned, but the distance, 16 M. P., is ab­

surdly wrong (/tin. Ant. p. 418). 9. From Oli-

bipo a great road ran parallel to the coast, up to

the mouth of the Durius and Bracaha Al'oi.'kta,

thus (Itin. Ant. pp. 420—422): Jkhabkiua,

30 M. P. (rid. mp.); Scalabis, 32 M. P. (rid.

nip.): Sfijji-m, 32 M. P. (Ptmrbalr); Coxf.m-

ukica, 34 M. P. (Cumbra, or further S.); Emi-

MUM, 10 M. P. (Agueda, Mintro, or CarvalhtM t

site very uncertain) , Tai.uiiuoa, 40 M. P.

(Areiro): Langouiiiga, 18 M. P. (near /Vino);

Cai.em, 13 M. P. (Oporto); Bkacara, 35 M. P.

(Braga); the last two, though originally Ltfcsi-

tanian, belong, according to the cf>minoa division, to

the CallaVci Brararii. Oilier places, not important

enough to require further notic, wid be fwumi ia

the lists of Ptolemy (ii. 5) and I'kert (vol. ii.

pt. 1. pp. 387—399). [P. &]

LU'SIUS. [UoitTTS.]

LUSO'XES (Aovauvft), the smallest of the fuar

tribes into which the Crltiberian* were divided.

Their im.sition was about the sources of the Tairut,

S\V. of the territory of Nuiuautia. (Strab. iii. p. 11"2;

Appian. Iliip. cc. 42, 49.) [P. S.]

LUSSO'NIUM (AoveoAvtor), also called Lns-

sunium, a town in Lower Paunonia, on the western

bank of the Danube, a little to tlw north of the

modern Pakt. It was the station of a body of

Dalmatian cavalry. (Ptol. ii. 16 § 4; XoL /*•/».;

/tin. Ant. p. 254; Tub. Pent., where it ia en, cd

Ltisione.) [L. S.]

LUTETIA PAMSIO'RUM (Aou*<rr«io, Pt.J.

ii. 8. § 13: AovKOTottia, Strabo. p. 194). the city

of the Parisii, a Gallic people on the Seine, Luleiia

is mentioned by Caesar (li. G. vi. 3), who held a

meeting of the Gallic states there in the spring of

B. c. 53. He calls it Lutetia Parisiorum ; and in

his narrative of the operatioas of Labienus in B- c

52, be says (B. G. vii. 57) that Lutetia is on an

island in the Seqiuina (Seine). Strabo copies this

description from Caesar. Vibius Sequester (p. II

ed. Oberlin) also describes Lutecia, as be writes it,

as being on an Island.

The Parisii were the neighbours of the Sefionex,

There had been some kind of political union brtweea

the Parisii and the Scnnncs before Caesar's UaJlie

campaigns (B. G. vi. 3). but at the time when

Caesar mentions them, they seem to have oe«-n

separate states. When Vercingetorix (n. c. 52) n»e

against the Homans, the S-nones, l'ari-sii. and otliTs

joined him immediately; and the Parisii sent 8OU0

men to oppose Caesar at Alesia (B. G. vii. 4, 75).

Though a part of the little territory of the Pan-ii

was north of the Seine, we must osiejado frfni

Caesar's narrative that they were a Celtic people.

The diocese of Paris repre.-*nts llie ten'itory ot' the

Parisii.

Lutetia, like many other Gallic towns, finally

took the name of the people, ajid was railed Civita*

Parisiorum, whence the modern name of Parim.

/.osimus (iii. 9) calls it Parisiutn. It appears fi ■ i

the Notit. Dign. that the Homans had a fleet at

Paris ; and from the words in the Notitia. " Prar-

t'ectus classis Andcritianonun Parisiis," D'Anti.l*

conjectures that the name "Anderitiani" implies a

i place Anderitium, which he further supposes to be

| Andriti, immediately below the jmu'.i.ji of tho

Stine and Oite. An inscription dug up in 1711

among other ancient monuments in the church of

| .Voire I)ame at Parit, contained the words " KanUe

Parisiaci:" and I)e Valuis observes that as tl»

people of Paris had always a fleet before their eyes,

they may from this circumstance have taken tl^

ship which appears in the arms of the city.

The position of Lutetia at Paris ia drlermined by

the description of the place, the name, and the

measurements of the roads from Agedincnm (5r»s>.
