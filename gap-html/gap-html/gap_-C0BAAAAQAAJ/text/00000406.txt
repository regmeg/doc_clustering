meter, several public buildings, and numerous in­

scribed sepulchres, somo of which have inscriptions

in the Lycian characters. But the place and its

splendid ruins have since been minutely described

by Sir C. Fellows (JJucov. in Lycia, p. 196, &c),

and in Texier's work (Uetcription de t Atk Mineure),

where the ruins are figured in 22 plates. The

theatre at Myra, says Sir Charles, is among the

largest and the best built in Asia Minor: much of

its fine corridor and corniced proscenium remains.

The number of tombs cut in the rock is not large,

but they are generally very spacious, and consist

of several chambers communicating with one another.

Their external ornaments are enriched by sculptured

statues in the rocks around ; but they are mostly

without inscriptions (see the plate of one in Sir C.

Fellows' Discov. facing p. 198, and numerous others

in a plate facing p. 200). On the whole, the ruins

of Myra are among the most beautiful in Lycia.

MYRCINUS (Mif/wiroj, Stcph. B.; MiVk.wos,

Tzctz. Chit. iii. 96: Eth. Mupitii'iot). a place be­

longing to the Edoni, on the left bank of the

Strymon, which was selected by Histiacus of Miletus

for his settlement. It offered great advantages to

settlers, as it contained an abundant supply of

timber for shipbuilding, as well as silver mines.

(Herod, vii. 23.) Aristagoras retired to this place,

and, scon after landing, perished before some Thra-

cian town which he was besieging. (Herod v. 126;

Thuc iv. 102.) Afterwards, it had fallen into the

hands of the Edoni; but on the murder of Pittacus,

chief of that people, it surrendered to Brasidas.

(Thuc iv. 107.) The position of Myreinus was in

the interior, to the N. of M. l'angaeus, not far

from Amphipolis. (Leake, North, Greece, vol. iii.

p. 181.) [E. B. J.]

MYRIAXDRUS. [Issus.]

MYRICUS (Mi/p«oi/>), a town on the coast of

Troy, "opposite," as Staph. Byz. (*. r.) says, "to

Tenedos and Lesbos," whence it is impossible to guess

its situation. It is not mentioned by any other

writer. [L. S.]

MYRl'NA (Mvplva: Eih. Mvpiva7ai), one of the

Aeolian cities on the western coast of Mysia, about

40 stadia to the south-west of Gryneium. (Herod.i.

149.) It is said to have been founded by one My-

rinus before the other Aeolian cities (Mela, :. 18). or

by the Amazon Myiina (Strab. xi. p. 505, xii. p. 573,

xiii. p. 623; Diod. iii. 54). Artaxerxcs gave Gry­

neium and Myrina toGongylus, an Eretrian, who had

lieen banished from his native city for favouring the

interests of Persia. (Xenoph. IJtllen. iii. 1. § 4.)

Myrina was a very strong place (Lit. xxxiii. 30),

though not very large, anil had a good harbour.

(Scylax, p. 36; Agath. Praef. p. 9, ed. Bonn.) Pliny

(v. 32) mentions that it bore the surname of

Sehastopolis; while, according to Syncellus, it was

also called Smyrna. For some time Myrina was

occupied by Philip of Macedonia; but the Romans

compelled him to evacuate it, and declared the place

free. (Liv. I. c j Polyh. xviii. 27.) It was twice

visited by severe earthquakes; first in the reign of

Tibeiine (Tac. Ann. ii. 47), on which occasion it

received a remission of duties on account of the loss

it had sustained; and a secmid time in the reign of

Trajan (Oros. vii. 12). The town was restored each

time, and continued to exist until a late period.

(Staph. Byz. '. v.; Plot. v. 2. § 6; Apolloa. Rhod. i.

C04; tlinot-l. p. 661; tieogr. R,w. v. 9, where it is

called Myrenna, while in the PeuL Tab. it bran tat

name Marinna.) Its site is believed te be oorapwd

by the modem Sanaarlih. [L. S.]
