80 C SAMXIVM. SAM5UUM.

of the Samnite territory is included in the Terra di

Lavoro, while a corner in the NW. is assigned to

the Abruzzi.

Of the national character of the Samnites we

learn little more than that they were extremely

brave and warlike, and had inherited to a great de­

gree the frugal and simple habits of their ancestors

the Sabines. We find also indications that they re­

tained the strong religious or superstitious feelings

of the Sabines, of which a striking instance is given

by I,ivy in the rites and ceremonies with which they

consecrated the troops that they levied in it. c. 293.

(Liv. x. 38.) But they had almost ceased to exist as

a nation in the days of the Latin poets and writers

that are preserved to us; and hence we cannot

wonder that their name is seldom alluded to. They

are said to have dwelt for the most part, like the

Sabines, in open villages; but it is evident, from

tile accounts of their earliest wars with the Komans,

that they possessed towns, and some of them, at

least, strongly fortified. This is confirmed, by the

remains of walls ol a very ancient style of construc­

tion, which are still pre^ierved at Ai-sernia and Bo-

vianum, and still more remarkably at Aufidena.

(Abeken, Mittel Jtalitn, pp. 142, 148.) But from

the very nature of their country the Sainnites must

always have been, to a great extent, a rude and

pastoral people, and had probably received only a

taint tinge of civilisation, through their intercourse

with the Campanians and Apulians.

III. Topography.

The rivers of the Samnite territory have been

already noticed in connection with the mountain

chains and groups in wliich they take their rise.

From the purely inland character of the region, none

of these rivers, with the exception of the Calor and

its tributaries, belong wholly to Samnium, but tra­

verse the territories of other nations before they

reach the sea. Thus the Sagrus and Trinius, after

quitting the mountains of Samnium, flow through

the land of the Frentani to the Adriatic; the TU

fernus separates the territory of that people from

Apulia, while the Frento and the Aufidus traverse the

plains of Apulia. On the other side of the central

chain the Vulturnus, with its affluent the Calor,

and the tributaries of the latter, the Sabatus and

Tainarus*. carry down the whole of the waters of

the Apennines of Samnium, which flow to the Tyr­

rhenian sea.

The tojmgraphy of Samnium is the most obscure

and confu.Ncd of any [>art of Italy. The reason of

this is obvious. From the continued wars which

had devastated the country; and the state of deso­

lation to which it was reduced in the time of the

geographers, only a few towns had survived, at

least in such a state as to be deemed worthy of no­

tice by them; and many of the names mentioned by

Livy and other authors during the early wars of the

Romans with the Sainnites never reappear at a later

period. It is indeed probable that some of these

were scarcely towns in the stricter sense of the term,

but merely fortified villages or strongholds, in which

the inhabitants collected their cattle and property

in time of war. Those which are mentioned by the

geographers as still existing under the Roman Em­

pire, or the site of wliich is clearly indicated, may be

briefly enumerated. Aufidkna, in the upper valley

of the Sagrus, is the only town that can be assigned

with any certainty to the Caraccni. In the upper

valley of the Vulturnus was Aeskrnia, the terri-

I tory of which bordered on tint of Yaafnr a

Campania. At the northern fuot of the M<»

Makse was Bovlanlm; and in the xmx:.x'i

tract between it and the Frentani was 1 tv>xsva

or Terevkntitm {Triccrtto). SE. of B^ii2-a
