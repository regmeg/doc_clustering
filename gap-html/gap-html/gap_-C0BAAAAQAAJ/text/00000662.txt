576 PERGAMUM. PKBGE.

Delphi by assassins said to have been hired by ,

Perseus; yet at a later period lie favoured the cause

of the Macedonian king, and thereby incurred the j

ill-will of the Romans. Pergamum was mainly in-'

debted to Eumcnes II. for its embellishment and

extension. He was a liberal patron of the arts and

sciences; he decorated the temple of Zeus Niee-

phorus, which had been built by Attalus outside the

city, with walks and plantations, and erected himself

many other public buildings; but the greatest monu­

ment of his liberality was the great library which

he founded, and which yielded only to that of Alex­

andria in extent and value. (Strab. lc; At hen. i.

p. 3.) He was succeeded by his son Attalus II.;

but the government was carried on by the late

king's brother Attalus, surnamed Philadelphus, from

b. c. 159 to 138. During this period the Per-

gamenians again assisted the Etonians against the

Pseudo-Philip. Attains also defeated Dlegylis, king

of i he Tbracian Caeni, and overthrew Prusias of

Hithynia. On his death, his ward and nephew,

Attalus III., surnamed Philometor, undertook the

reins of government, from B.C. 138 to 133, and on

his death bequeathed his kingdom to the Romans.

Sniu after, Aristonicus, a natural son of Kumenes II..

revolted and claimed the kingdom of Pergamum for

himself; but in B. c. 130 he was vanquished and

taken prisoner, and the kingdom of Pergamum be­

came a Roman province under the name of Asia

(Strab. /. c, xiv. p. 646.) The city of Pergamum,

however, continued to flourish and prosper under the

Roman dominion, so that Pliny (/. c.) could still call

it 41 lon^e clarissimum Asiae Pergamum;" it re­

mained the centre of jurisdiction for the district, and

of commerce, as all the main-roads of Western Asia

converged there. 1'ergainuin was one of the Seven

Churches mentioned in the book of Revelations.

Under the Byzantine emperors the greatness and pros­

perity of the city declined; but it still exists under

the name of Bergamah, and presents to the visitor

numerous ruins and extensive remains of its ancient

magnificence. A wall lacing the .south-oast of the

acropolis, of hewn granite, is at least UK) feet deep,

and engrafted into the rock; above it a course oi.

large substructions forms a spacious area, upon

which once rose a temple unrivalled in sublimity of

situation, being visible from the vast plain and the

Aegean sea. The ruins of this temple show that it

was built in the noblest style. Besides this there

ar<> ruins of an ancient temple of Aesculapius, which,

like the Nieephorion, was outside the city ( lac.

Ann. iii. 63; Paus. v. 13. § 2); of a royal palace,

which was surrounded by a wall, and connected with

the Ca'icus by an aqueduct; of a prytaneum, a

theatre, a gymnasium, a stadium, an amphitheatre,

and other public buildings. All these remains

attest the unusual splendour of the ancient city, and

all travellers speak with admiration of their stu-

pendous greatness. The numerous coins which we

poxao.ss "f Pergamum attest that Olympia were

celebrated there; a vase found there represents a

torch-raco on horseback; and Pliny (x. 25) relates

that public cock-tights took place there every year.

Pergamum was celebrated for its manufacture of

ointments (Allien, xv. p. 089), pottery (Plin. xxxv.

46), and parchment, w hich derives its name (chai ta

Pergamena) from the city. The library of Perga-

mum, which is said to have consisted of no less than

200,000 volumes, was iriven by Antony to Cleopatra
