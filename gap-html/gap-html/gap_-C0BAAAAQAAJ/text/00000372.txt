334 MIGONIUM. MIDIANITAE.

"aptior armentis Midea," and the selection of this

place as the residence of the horse-Iovinp Hippo-

dameia in her banishment. (Boblayc, Rtchtrckes,

«jV. p. 52; Leake, Ptloponnesiaca, p. 268; Curtius,

Pehpotmesos, rol. ii. p. 395.)

2. A city of BoeotiiL [Lebapeia.]

MIDIANTTAE (MaSmwrai), the descendants of

Midian, one of the suns of Abraham by Keturah,

whom the patriarch is said to have sent away during

his lifetime ** eastward, unto the east country"

{Gen. xxv. 2,6), and whom we subsequently find

reckoned among " the children of the east." (Judy.

vi. 3.) In the third generation after Abraham they

were a distinct people, trading between Gilead and

Egypt; but are associated with, or confounded

with, another Arab family, the Ishmaclites. {Gen.

xxxviii. 25, 28, 3G.)

The Midianites were probably a Bcdawi tribe,

and their situation may be pretty accurately de­

termined, by the fallowing notices, to the territory

afterwards occupied by the Nabataei, to the south

and east of Falaestiue. Muses fed the sheep of

Jethro, a priest of Midian. in the peninsula of Mount

Sinai, and about Mount Horeb (Exod, iii. 1); sub­

sequently Jethro came to his son-in-law from the

land of Midian, while Israel was encamped in the

vicinity of Horeb (xviii. 2, &c.); and Moses was

glad to avail himself of his local knowledge while

traversing the desert to the north of the peninsula.

(Numb. x. 29—32). The close alliance between

the Midianites and the Moabites, to oppose the pro­

gress of Israel, indicates the proximity of the two

peoples; and the hostility of the former proves that

the alliance of Moses with one of their family did

not conciliate the national feeling. (Xumb. xxii. 4, 7,

xxv. xjtxi. 8—12 ; Jo*h, xiii. 21.)

The Midianites continued the bitter enemies of

the Israelites throughout the period of the Judges,

when, in concert with "the Arnalekites and the

children of the east," they invaded simultaneously,

and in countless numbers, the southern frontier

towards Gaza and the trans-Jordanic tribes in

Gilead and Bashaii (Judy. vi. vii.), from whence

they extended their ravages to the west, and

north as fur as the confines of Kaphthali and

Asher. After their signal defeat by Gideon, they

disappear from the records of history, but their

slaughter became proverbial (Psalm Uxxiii. 9;

Isaiah, ix. 4, x. 26.)

The country of the Midianites, however, had

still a traditionary recollection; and subsequent no­

tice*, consistently with the foregoing, place them

between Edom and i'uran, which bordered on Egypt

(1 Kings, xi. 17, 18), in the country afterwards

comprehended under the name of Idumaea, and still

later assigned to the Saracen I. Indeed Jo&ephus

(.4 nt iv, 7. § 1) asserts that Petra, tho capital of

Arabia (i. e. Idumaea), was called by the natives

Areceme' ('Ap«*f^tVi), from the Midianitish king

Kekem. one of the five slain by Moses. (Xumb.

xxxi. 8) Eusebitu and St. Jerome mention a city

Madian, so named after one of the sons of Abraham

by Keturah, situated beyond Arabia (i.e. Idumaea)

to the south, in the desert of the Saracens, by the

Bed Sea, from which the district was called; and

another city of the same name near the Anion and

Areopolis; the ruins of which only existed in their

days. (OnomasL $. v.; com p. Hieron. Cvmm. ad Jts.

Ix. and Ezech. xxv.)

The situation of these two cities would define

the limits uf the territory of the Midianites in

their most palmy days. The former of tbw*

two cities is doubtless that mentioned by JtwfJw

(Ant. ii. 11. § 1) under the name of M»iwm

(MaoYnp^), situated at the Red Sea, and *

properly identified by Keland as the m^ern 1/i-

dyan (the Madiun of Abulfeda), identical with iLt

Mnriiana of Ptolemy. (Keland, PalarMtata, pp. i:*

—100.) It is situated about half-way 6m

the eastern coast nf the Elanitic gulf. (Fentrr,

Geog. i>f Arabia, vol. ii. p. 116; and h«e the rrfc-

rences in his index under Midian.) [G. W.]

MIEZA (Mi«fo: Eth. Mi«fo«»T, Mi«f>fa), a

Macedonian city, the position of which it is most

difficult toascertain. Stephanus of Byzantium (a.r.),

on the authority of Theagenes, assigns to an rp>ey-

mous founder, Mieza, a sister of Ben*a, and grand­

daughter of Macedon: this legend implies that it

was an important city. Krom the name it would

seem most natural to l<*ok for it in the neigbbourhrtd

of Beroea, which agrees with Ptolemy (iii 13. §39),

who classes it among the cities of Emathia, Stc­

phanus, on the other hand, still deriving his in­

formation apparently from Theagenes, alludes to it

as a t6vos ^TpvpSrot, and adds tliat it was some­

times called Stryuioninm. Alexander the Gmi

established an Aristotelian school at Mieza (I'.x*.

Alex. M. 7); and it was famed for a stmlicutac

cavern. (Plin. xxxi. 2. s. 20; Leake, A'orta. Greece,

vol. iv. p. 583.) [E. B. J.]

MIGDOL, a Hebrew word signifying ** a tower,"

and used as a complement of several proper names

of places in Holy Scripture.

1. Migdol-Edek, translated in (Ten. xxxr. 31

(v. 16 in LXX.), tov wiyyov TaSip, Autk Ver.

"the tower of Eder;" and in Mkak, iv. 8.. »*Vr*»

wotuviov, Auth. Ver. "tower of the flock * (mare.

"Edar"). From the first cited passage, it *oui

appear to have been near Bethlehem ; and St. Jer-o*

mentions a shepherd's tower a mile from Be- bleiira,

so called, as he suggests, in prophetic «nti<ip,i.i -a

of the angelic announcement of the Nativity. ((A*»*

rnast. s. r.; Keland, Palaestina, «. r. p. 898.)

2. Miopol-El, a town in the tribe of N*phth*it

(Josh, xix. 38), where the LXX, running two

names together, read MtyaXaaptfs for ** MigdaW,

Horem." Eusebins and St Jerome mention it a* a

large village named Magdiel, ix. M. P. (St. Jenaaa

writes v. M. P.) from Dura on the road to Ptueamak,

probably identical with the modern El-MejAi. m

the j.lain of Esdraelon, a little to the SW. of fiU/a

'Amar, which is, however, more remote than «-v*c

Eusebius states from Dora, t. e, the modern Tam?i**x.

Neither could this have any connectioo with i--*

Migdal-el of Kaphthali, as Beland, in ajrroraw:

with his two authors, seems to imagine, herir-c t

was situated in the tribe of Asher or Lmacaar.

(Keland, Valorstina, p. 898.) The Macdshai of

(ialilee (now EUMtjdtl) it much more prufaably lb*

Migdal-el of Naphthah. [Magdala.]"

3. Mir,DAl,-GAD (ViaryahaXyal. LXX.), a eity «f

the tribe of Judah. (Jo$k. xv. 37 )

4. MlGPAL-ftKKNA, corrupted to Mr?dA« SreW

in Eusebius (<>nomast. s. v. S*ima\ wbirb, how­

ever, St. Jerome's translation enables ua to cutTwct t*

Mi?oaA 2*yra, "quod inter|4etatur turrit Srt. -a"

There is yet another corruption uf the Grrrk cor­
