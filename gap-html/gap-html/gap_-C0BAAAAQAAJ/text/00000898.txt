VII. The Aventine.

We have already adverted to the anomalous cha­

racter of this hill, and how it was regarded with

Ruspicmn in the early times of Rome, as ill-omened.

Yet there were .several famous spots upon it, having

traditions connected with them as old or older than

those relating to the Palatine, as well as several re­

nowned and antique temples. One of the oldest of

these legendary monuments was the Ai.tak of

EvANDBR,which sto->d at the foot of the hill, near the

Porta Trigemina. (Dionya. i. 3'2.) Not far from it,

near the Salinae, was the Cave of Caccs, a name

which a part of the hill near the river still retains.

(Solinus, i. 8; .cf. Virg. Aai, viii. 190, seq.; Ovid,

Fast, i. 551, seq.) Here also was the altar said to

have been dedicated hy Hercules, after he had found

the cattle, to Jupiter INVKSTOB. (Dionys. i. 39.)

A spot on the summit of the hill, called ReMORLa,

or Remuria, preserved the memory (if the auspices

taken by Reruns. (Paul. Diac. p. 27C; Dionys. i.

85, seq.) Niebuhr, however, assumes another hill

beyond the basilica of St. Paolo, and consequently

far OUUlde the walls of Aurelian, to have been the

place called Kemoria, destined by Remus for the

building of hie city. (Hist, i. p. 223, seq. and note

618.) Other spots connected with very ancient

traditions, though subsequent to the foundation of

the city, were the Annilustrium and the Lauretum.

The AftMlLUflTBt'M, or Annilustrium, at h'rst indi­

cated only a festival, in which the soldiers, armed

with ancttfa, performed certain military sports and

sacrifices; but the name was subsequently applied

to the place where it was celebrated. (Varr. L.L.

v. § 153, vi. § 22, HUH.; Liv. xxvii. 37; Plut Horn.

23.) Plutarch (/. c.) says that king Tatius was

buried here; but the Lauretum, so named from

its grove of laurels, is also designated as his place

of sepulture. (Varr. L.L, v. § 152; Plin. xv.

§ 40; Dionys. iii. 43; Festus, p. 3Gt>.) There wjis

a distinction between the Lauretum Majus and Mi­

nus {Cat. (.'apran. Id. Aug.): and the Basis Capi-

tolina mentions a Vitus Loreti Majoris and another

Loreti Minoria. The same document also record* a

Vicus Armilustri. Numa dedicated an altar to

Jupiter Elicits on the Aventine. (Varr. L.L. vi.

§ 54; Liv. i. 20; cf. Or. F. iii. 295, wo.); i

Calendars indicate a sacrifice to be perfuraai 4

to Consus (Fast. Capran. XII. KaL S*p;i

Amttern. Pr. Id. Itec.); but thia is \

same deity whose altar we have menu
