HOC TARSUS. TARTESSIS

was the chief city of Cilkia, and one of the most

important places in all Asia Minor. It was situated

in a most fertile and productive plain, on both sides

of the river Cydnus, which, at a distance of 70 stadia

from the city, flowed into a lagoon called Rhegma or

Rliegmi. This lagoon formed tlie port of Tarsus,

and was connected with the sea. The situation of

the city was most favourable, for the river was

navigable up to Tarsus, and several of the most

important roads of Cilkia met there. Its foundation

is ascribed to Sardanapalus, the Assyrian kin?, and

the very name of the city seems to indicate its

Semitic origin. But the Greeks claimed the honour

of having colonised the place at a very early period;

and, among the many stories related by them about

the colonisation of Tarsus, the one adopted by Strabo

(xiv. p. 673; comp. Steph. B. s. p.) ascribes the

foundation to Argives who with Triptolemus arrived

there in search of Io. The first really historical

mention of Tarsus occurs in the Anabasis of Xe-

nophon, who describes it as a great and wealthy

city, situated in an extensive and fertile plain at

the foot of the passes of Mount Taurus leading into

Cappadocia and Lycaonia. {Anab. i. 2. § 23, &e.)

The city then contained the palace of Syennesis,

king of Cilkia, but virtually a satrap of Persia, and

nil equivocal ally of Cyrus when he marched against

his brorher Artaxerxcs. When Cyrus arrived at

Tarsus, the city was for a time given up to plunder,

the troops of Cyrus being exasperated at the loss

sustained by a detachment of Cilicians in crossing

the mountains. Cyrus then concluded a treaty with

Syennesis, and remained at Tarsus for 20 days. In

the time of Alexander we no longer hear of kings;

but a Persian satrap resided at Tarsus, who fled

before the young conqueror and left the city, which

surrendered to the Macedonians without resistance.

Alexander himself was detained there in consequence

of a dangerous fever brought on by bathing in the

Cydnus. (Arrian, Anab. ii. 4; Curt, iii, 5.) After

the time of Alexander, Tarsus with the rest of Cilicia

belonged to the empire of the Seleucidac, except

during the short period when it was connected with

Egypt under the second and third Ptolemy. Pompey

delivered Tarsus and Cilicia from the dominion of

the eastern despots, by making the country a Roman

province. Notwithstanding this, Tarsus in the war

between Caesar and Pompey sided with the former,

who on this account honoured it with a per­

sonal visit, in consequence of which the Tarsiaus

changed the name of their city into Juliopolis. (Caes.

Ii. Alex. 66; Dion Cass, xlvii. 24; Klor. iv. 2.)

Cassius afterwards punished the city for this attach­

ment to Caesar by ordering it to be plundered, but

M. Antony rewarded it with municipal freedom and

exemption from taxes. It is well known how Antony

received Cleopatra at Tarsus when that queen sailed

up the Cydnus in a magnificent vessel in the disguise

of Aphrodite. Augustus subsequently increased the

favours previously bestowed upon Tarsus, which on

coins is called a '' libera eivitas." During the first

centuries of the empire Tarsus was a place of great

importance to the Romans in their campaigns against

the J'arthians and lVr.->iaiis. The emperor Tacitus,

his brother Klorian, and Maximinus and Julian died

at Tarsus, and Julian was buried in one of its sub­

urbs. It continued to be an opulent town until it

tell into the hands of the Saracens. It was, how­

ever, taken from them in the second half of the 10th

century by the emperor Nicephorus, but was soon

after again restored to them, and has remained in

I their hands ever since. The torn still e»>
