1336 ZELA. ZALICHES.

Peripl P. E. p. 9); and this place seems to be the |

same as the one mentioned in the Peut. Table under

the corrupt name of Halega, at a distance of 25 J

Roman miles from Zacoria. Hamilton (Researches, I

i. p. 298) identities the bite of Zalecus with the i

modern Alitchain, where some ruins and massive

walls are still seen. [L. S.]

ZALICHES (ZaAi'x^s), a town in tlie interior of

Paphlagonia, or what, at a late period, was called ,

Helleuopontus, probably near some mountain forest,

as Hieroeles (p. 701) calls it 2ctATos ZaAi'xT?? (.Vo-

vell. 28 ; Cone. Nicacn. ii. p. 355, where a bishop

of Zaliches is mentioned, and p. 163, from which it

would seem that at one time the place bore the

name of Leontopolis.) [L, S.] |

ZAMA (Zdfxa Ptol. iv. 3. § 33), a town

of Numidia, situated five days' journey to the SW.

of Cart base. (Pofyb. xv. 5; Liv. xxx. 29.) It lay

between Sicca Veneris and Suffetula, and bore the

name of ''Regis;" whence we find it erroneously

written Zainareigia in tlie Tab. Pent. Zama is par­

ticularly renowned as the scene <>f Scipio's victory

over Hannibal in 201 B.C. It was a very strong

place, and hence adopted as a residence by Juba,

who brought his harem and his treasure hither, as

to a place of safety. (Hirt. B. Afr. 91; Vitruv.

viii. 3. ("i* 4.) § 24.) Strabo represents it as de­

stroyed by tlie Romans, and as being in a ruinous

state in his time (xvii. pp. 829, 831). But it must

have been subsequently restored, since Pliny (v. 4.

s. 4) mentions tlie Zamense oppiduin as a free city.

It also appears in the Tab, Pent., and a bishop of

Zama is mentioned by St. Augustine. (Ife Civ.

Del. vii. 16 ) In an inscription in Gruter (364. 1)

Zama Regis appears with tlie title of a colony (Col.

Aelia Hadriana); though it is not mentioned as a

colony in any of the ancient writers. It is the pre­

terit Jama, SE. of Kess. (Of. Dion Cass, xlviii.

23: Sail. J. 60, 61.) [T. H. D.]

ZAMA (Zi.ua), a town of the district of Chamma-

nene, in Capjiadocia, on the borders of Galatia.

(Ptol. v. 18. § 12; Tab. Peut.) [L. S.]

ZAMAE PONS, a spring in Africa, probably

near the town of Zama, which had the property of

rendering the voice clear and strong. (Plin. xxxi,

2. s. 12.) [T. H. D.]

ZAMES (Zci.utjs, Ptol. vi. 7. §§ 20, 21), a moun­

tain chain in the interior of Arabia Felix, which

stretched as far as the borders of Arabia De­

serts. It is probably the present Jubel Aared, or

Jmaryek. [T. H. D.]

ZANCLE. [Messana-1

ZAO PROMONTOIilUM, a headland on the coast

of Gallia Narbonensis, and east of Massilia (Mar­

seille). Pliny (iii. 4), after mentioning Massilia

tays, " Pi'omontorium Zao, Citbarista Port us. Kegio

Camatullicorum. Dein Suclteri." It is not easy to

identity Zao. Ukert conjectures that it may he Bee

de Sonnion. In the Stattstiqtte du.Dep. des Bouches

du Ithvne, it is supposed to be Cap de la Croisettc.

This is a rocky coast, which has undergone little

change for many centuries. (Ukert, Gallkn, p.

120.) [G.L.]

ZAPAORTENI. [Afavarcticene.]

ZARA (Ziipa), a town in tlie northern part of

There is some doubt about the oribocrapby « t£-»

name, which in some editions is written Zainies.

There can be no doubt that in either case it i* ds-

is the same as the Hesvdrus ot Pliny (vL 17- %.
