the font of the Cottlan Alps. This was there­

fore one of the great highroads leading to Gaul.

But the stations on it, as given in the Tabula, are

very confused, ami can only partially be. restored by

the assistance of the Antonine Itinerary, which no­

where gives this road in its entirety. At Ticinum it

was joined by another road leading from Mediolanum

to that city. The stations, xs given m the Jerusalem

VIA AEMILIA SCAURI, is the name given, for

the sake of distinction, to a road which was con­

structed by Aeinilius Scaurus long after the more

celebrated Via Aemilia above described. Strabo,

the only anther who distinctly mentions the two,

says that Aemiiins Scaurus, after having drained the

marshes on the S. hide of tlie l'adus, constructed the

Aemilian Way through l'isae and Luna as far as Sa-

bata, and thence through Dertona. (Strab. v. p. 217.)

Whether " the other Aemilian Way," as Strabo calls

it, had been already continued from Placentia to

Dertona, or this also was tir>t effected by Scaurus,

we know not; but it is clear that the two were

thus brought into connection. The construction of

this great work must he assigned to the censorship

ot M. A' milius Scaurus, in B.C. 109, as we learn from

Amelias Victor( Vir. III. 72), who, however, probably

confounds it with the more celebrated Via Aemilia

from Placentia to Ariniinum. But a comparison of

the two authors leaves no doubt as to the road really

meant. The name seems to have gradually fallen

into disuse, probably on account of the ambiguity

arising between the two Viae of the same name ; and

we rind both the coast-road from Pisae to Vada

Sabata, and that across the mountains from the

latter place by Aquae Statiellae to Dertona, included

by the Itineraries as a part of the Via Aurelia, of

which the former at least was in fact a mere conti­

nuation. Hence it will be convenient to discuss the

stations and distances along these lines, under the

general head ot Via AliREiJA. [E. H. B.]

VIA AMERINA, is the name given in an in­

scription of the time of Hadrian (Orell. Inter. 3306)

to a line of road, which must obviously be that lead­

ing direct from Rome to Ameria. Tins', as we learn

from the Tabula, branched off from the Via Cassia

at Baccanae (Baccano), and proceeded through Ne-

pete and Falerii to Ameria. The stations and dis­

tances as tliere given are:—

Rome to Baccanae - - - - sxi. M. r.

Nepete (Nepi) - - - ix.

I'aler ii (Sta Maria di

I'alhri) - - - - v.

Castelluin Amerinum - xii.

The sum of these distances (50 miles) agrees

precitely with the statement of Cicero, wLo, in the

oration Pro Sexto Rotcio Amerino (o 7. § it).

serves that it was 56 miles from Ameria to Kraa,

According to the Tabula a pr-fifi^atHM of tat

same road led from Ameria to Tuckr. anc taa

by a circuitous route through Yet ton* and F^r^a

to Clusium, where it rejoined the Via. Ca&aa. Tie
