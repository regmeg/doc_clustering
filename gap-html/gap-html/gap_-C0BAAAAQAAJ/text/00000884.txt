79 G ROMA. ROMA.

Btatae was discovered with an inscription purporting

that it was erected by the guild of bakers to Anto­

ninus Tins. In the time of Palladio the temple was

a jrreat deal more perfect tiian it is at present, and

had an atrium in front, in the middle of which stood

the bronze equestrian statue of M. Aurelius, which

now adorns the Capitol, (Arrhitttturn, lib. iv. c. 9.)

The inscription in Grater (celia. 6) probably be­

longed to the pedestal of this .statue. It was found

in the Sacra Via in 15G2. Sonic difficulty, however,

arises with regard to this account, since from various

other sources we learn that the statue stood for a

long while before the church of St. John I.atcran.

From Palladio's account of tlie corlile, or court, it

wonki appear that the building lay some distance

back from the Sacra Via.

In the reign of Commodus a instructive fire,

which lasted several days, occasioned much damage

in the neighbourhood of the forum, and destroyed

among other things the temple of Vesta. (Hcrodian,

i. 14.) According to Dion Capitis the same fire ex­

tended to the Palatine and coiiMimed almost all the

records of the empire (laxii. 24). It wax on the

t-ame occasion that the shop of (ialen, which stood

on the* Sacra Via, was burnt down, and also the

Palatine Library, as he himself assures us. (Oe

Compos. Medkam, i. c. 1.)

This damage seems to have been repaired by

Septiinius Sevcrus, the munificent restorer of the

Roman buildings, who with a rare generosity com­

monly refrained from inscribing his own name upon

them, and left their honours to the rightful founders

(" Homae omnes aedes publican, quae vitio temporum

labebantur, in*tauravit; nusquam prope suo nomine

inscripto, servatis tamen ubique titulis conditornm,"

Spart. Sever, c. ult.). Of the original monuments

erected by that emperor the principal one wis the Ait-

ctis Sevkui or triumphal arch, which still exists in

good preservation at the top of the Roman forum. The

inscription informs us that it was dedicated to S^e-

rus, as well as to his two sons. Caracal la and tieta, in

Caracalla that a chariot with six horses and iwrsons

within it stood on the summit of the arch, and other

perNniis on hor>i'back at the sides, opposed to be

the emperor's sons. It was erected partly in front

of the temple of Concord, so as in some degree to

cmceal the view of that building, and thus to dis-
