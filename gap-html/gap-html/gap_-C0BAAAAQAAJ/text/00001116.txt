1032 spoletium. SPERCHEIUS.

drawing is generally in the best style of Aegyptian

art. They represent various events in tlie life of

Neooptli. From the tomb of Hotel, indeed, might be

compiled a very copious record of the domestic life

of tin? Aegyptians. On its walls are depicted,

among many others, the following subjects: the

return of warriors with their captives; wrestlers;

hunting wild boasts and deer: the Nile boats, m-

cludintr the liari or high-prowed barge, and fisheries;

granaries and flax-dressing; spinniug and weaving;

games with the lance, the ball, and the discus; and

the rites of sepulture. The tomb of Amenheme is

covered also with representations of men in various

postures of wrestling; and the other grottoes are not

less interesting for their portraitures of civil and

donipstic life. (Wilkinson, Modern Egypt and

Thebes; Rosellini, Man. Civ. vol. i.; Kenrick, Anc.

fyf/pf, vol. i. p. 47. foil.) [W.B.D.]

SPERCHEIUS (2TepXei(Is: Ellddka), a river in

the S. of Thessaly, rising in Mount Tymphrestus

(Strab. is. p. 433), and flowing into the Maliac

gulf. The Dryopes and Amianes dwelt iu the upper

part of its course till it entered the plain of Malis,

through which it flowed to the sea. In ancient

times it joined the sea at Anticyra; and the rivers

Dyras, Melas, and Asopus fell separately into the

.sea to the S. of the Spercheius. (Herod, vii. 198.)

But the Spercheius has changed its course, and now

falls into the sea much further south, about a mile

from Thermopylae. The Dyras and Melas now unite

their streams, and fall into the Spercheius, as does

al>o the Asopus. [Thermopylae.] Spercheius

is celebrated in mythology as a river-god [Did. of

Jiiof/r. s. t'.], and is mentioned in connection with

Achilles. (Horn. //. xvii. 142.) Its name also

frequently occurs in the other poets. (Aesch. Pers,

4MG; Sophocl. Phil. 722; Virg. Georg. ii. 485;

Lucan, vi. 36G.) (Leake, Northern Greece, vol. ii.

pp. S, U, 15.)

SPERCHIAE, a place in Thessaly, which, accord­

ing to the description of Livy (xxxii. 13), would

s'Ttn to have been situated at no great distance from

the sources of the Spercheius. Ptolemy (iii. 13.

^ 17) mentions a place Sjiercheia between Echinus

and Thebes in Phthiotis; and Pliny (iv. 7. s. 13)

j.laces Sperchios in Doris. It is probable that these

three names indicate the same place, but that its real

position was unknown.

SPINA (StiVo, Strub.; Xvlva, Steph. B.: Elk.

2n"n aT7;f and Sirti'iTijs), an ancient city of Italy,

situated near the southernmost mouth of the Padus,

within the limits of Gallia Cisalptna. It was, accord­

ing to Dionysius, a Pelasgic settlement, and one of

the most flourishing cities founded by that people in

Italy, enjoying for a considerable time the dominion

ot the Adriatic, and deriving great wealth from its

commercial relations, so that the citizens had a

treasury at Delphi, which they adorned with costly

offerings. They were subsequently expelled from

their city by an overwhelming force of barbarians,

and compelled to abandon Italy. (Dionys. i. 18,

2S.) Saabo gives a similar account of the naval

greatness of Spiaa, as well as of its treafuni' Efe

but he calls it a Greek (Hellenic) city; i»i Stria,

who notices only Greek, or reputed Orw. a\jn\

mentions Spina apparently as such. I'j Gtm

origin is confirmed also by Justin, irbw la'-h-Jrtj,

however, is not worth much. (Strab. t. f*.3l4, ll

p. 421; Scyl. p. 6. § 19; Justin, xx. 1; 1*1* ia.lt.

s. 20.) But these authorities, at well at tie faa

that it had a treasury at Delphi, which i> niaWf

historical, seem to exclude the supjusirkc thai ;*. n
