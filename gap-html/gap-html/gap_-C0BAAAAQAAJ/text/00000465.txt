ttt Htrpisi. about 20 miles W. of Luceria. An

i-aciption foraul here would seem to attest that

aWmtu existed as a municipal town as late as

1*« rafo of Severus; but considerable doubts have

km m«d of its authenticity. (Romanelli, vol. ii.

W tJcrred from the comparison of the au-

thorities. Ptolemy mentions two places of the name

one in Gedrosia, and the other in Caramania; but

there can be no doubt that the same place is in­

tended. Arrian Bpeaks of a place which he calls ra

MoTapvo, on the coast of Gedrosia, which was occu­

pied by the Ichthyophagi {Indie. 26). Vincent, who

has examined this geographical question with much

care, thinks that this port must have been situated

a little west of the modern cape Passenee or Pasmee.

{Voyage of Nearchus, vol. i. p. 242.) The differ­

ence of position in the ancient geographers may be

accounted for by the fact that Musama must have

been on the boundary between Gedrosia and Cara­

mania. Ptolemy speaks of a tribe, whom he calls

Musarnaei {Movaapvaiot, vi. 21. § 4). There can

be little doubt that they were the people who lived

around Musarna. [^*]

MUSO'NES (Amm. Marc. xxix. 5. § 27; Mot

o'oui'oi, Ptol. iv. 3. § 24; Mussiui, Plin. v. 4.

s. 4; Musuuii, Pevt. Tab.), a Moorish tribe, who

joined in the revolt of Pirmus. (Amm. Marc I c.;

com p. St. Martin, Le Beau, Bos Empire, vol. iii.

p. 475.) [E. B.J.]

MUSTI {Kovari, Ptol. iv. 3. § 33), a town of

Numidia, which the Antonine Itinerary places at 34

M. P. (32 M. P. Peat. Tab.) from Sicca Veneria,

92 M. P. from Sufetula, 86 M. P. from Carthage,

119 M. P. (by Tipasa) to Cirta; all which distances

(considering that the roads are indirect) agree with

the position assigned to it by Shaw {Trav. p. 179)

and Bartb (Wanderungen, p. 221) at 'Abd-er-

Rabbi, so called from the tomb of a "Marabout.''

According to Vibius Sequester {de Flum. p. 7),

it was near the river Bagradas; but Shaw (to.),

who first discovered the site, by the remains of a

triumphal arch, and a stone with an inscription

bearing the ethnic name "Musticensium," speaks of

it as being at some distance from the present coarse

of the Mejerdah. [E. B. J.]

MUSL'LA'MII (Tac. Ann. ii. 52, iv. 24; MiaW-

Acyioi, Ptol. iv. 3. § 24; Misulanii, Peut. Tab.),

a Moorish tribe, whom Ptolemy (/. c.) places to the

S. of Cirta, at the foot of Audum. Tacitus (/. c.)

gives them a more westerly position, and describes

the defeat of this powerful tribe under Tacfarinas,

their leader. [E. B. J.]

MUTE'NUM, a place in Upper Pannonia, on the

road from Vindobona to Celeia, and probably occu­

pying the same site as the modern Muzon. {It.

MUl'ilUL, a river of Numidia, which, from its

being in the division belonging to Adherbal, must be

MU'TIXA (M™r(m, Strab.; M0T1V7), Pol.;

Movtivo, Ptol.: Eth. Mutinensis: Modem), an im­

portant city of Gallia Cispadana, situated on the Via

Acmilia, between Panna and Bononia. It was

35 miles distant from the former, and 25 from

the latter city. (Strab. v. p. 216; Itin. Ant.

p. 127; Itin. liter, p. 616.) It appears to hiive

certainly existed previous to the conquest of this

part of Italy by the Humans, and was not impro­

bably of Etruscan origin. Livy tells us, that the

district or territory in which it was situated, was

taken from the Boians, and had previously belonged

to the Etruscans (Liv. xxxix. 55); but he does

not mention the city. Nor do we know at what

period the latter felt into the hands of the Romans,

though it was probably during the Gaulish War

(n.c. 225—222), as we find it in their undisturbed
