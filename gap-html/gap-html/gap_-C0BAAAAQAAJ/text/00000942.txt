854 ROMA. KOMA.

appeared at Stnttgard in 1820, the last in 1842.

As a literary production — we are speaking ot"

course of the ancient parts — it is of little service to

the scholar. The descriptions art- verbose, and the

ancient ones being intermingled with the modern

have to be sought through a voluminous work.

A still graver detect is the almost entire absence,

especially in the earlier volumes, ot all citation of

authorities.

At this period in the history of Roman topography

W. A. Keeker, paid a short visit to Rome.

Keeker took up the subject ot* his researches as a

jwiint of national honour; anil in his first tract, Dt

Romae Yeteris Muris atque Portis (Leipzig, 1842),

devoted two pages ot the preface to an attack u]*>n

Caiiina, whom he suspected of the grave offence of a

want of due reverence for German scholarship. But

with an inborn pugnacity his weaponswerealsoturned

airainst his own countrymen. Amidalittlefaint praise,

the labours of Bunsen and Urlichs were censured as

incomplete and unsatisfactory. In the following year

(1843) Becker published the first vuluinc of his Hand-

buck der HOmischen Altert/iumer, containing a view

of the topography of Rome. A review of his work

by L. Preller, which appeared in the Neue Je-

tuiitsche Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung, though writ­

ten with candour and moderation, seems to have

stung Becker into fury. lie answered it in a

pamphlet entitled Die Riimischt Topographs in

faun, cine Wantung (Leipsig, 1844), in which lie

accused Preller of having taken up the cudgels in

favour of Canina, though that gentleman is a mode­

rate adherent of the German school of topographers.

Nothing can exceed the arrogant tone of this pam­

phlet, the very title of which is offensive. U was

answered by L'rlichs in bis Romische Topographie

in Leipzig (Stuttgart, 18-15), in which, though

Keeker well deserved casligation, the author adopted

too much of the virulent and personal tone of his

adversary. The controversy was brought to a close

by a reply and rejoinder, both written with eijual

bitterness: but the dispute has served to throw

light on some questions of Roman topography. In

a purely literary point of view, Keeker's I land-

hue h must be allowed to be a very useful production,

rib views are arranged and stated with great clear­

ness, and the constant citation of authorities at the

bottom of the page is very convenient to the stu­

dent. The writer of this article feels himself bound

to acknowledge that it would not have been pos­

sible for him to have prepared it without the as­

sistance ot Keeker's work. Nevertheless he is of

opinion that many of Keeker's views on the most

important points of Roman topography are entirely

erroneous, and that they have gained acceptation

only from the extraordinary confidence with winch

they are asserted and the display of learning by

which they are supported. Amongst other Ger­

man tojographers we need only mention here L.

Pivller, who h;ts dune good service by some able

papers and by his useful work on the Regions of

Augustus (Die Region-en der Stadt Rom, Jena,

1840. 8vo.). We may add that the English reader

will find a succinct and able sketch of the views of

the German school, and particularly of Keeker, in a

series of very valuable papers by Mr. Bunbury, pub­

lished in the Classical Museum (vols, iii.iv. and v.).

We shall close this list with the names of two

modern Italian topographers. Between the years

1820 and 1835. Stefano l'iale published some very

useful dissertations on various points of Roman to-

pography, among which the followinff ttjt br *a—
