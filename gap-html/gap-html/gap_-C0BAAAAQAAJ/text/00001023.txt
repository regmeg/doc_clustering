SCYLAX. SCYROS. G35

J7BALM.] In n. c. 124 the Humans, at the insti-

r»tm cf C. Grace has, sent a colony to Scylacium,

*&tdi sppeart to have assumed the name of Miner-  
>imi or Colunia Minervia. (Veil. Pat. i. 15; Momm-

in BerickU der Sdckruchen GueUschaft der

,i umuoto/im, 1849, pp. 49—51.) The name is

■ n:tfn by Yelleius " Scclatium;" and the form "Sco-

mvn" U fi>und also in an inscription of the reign of

tiuiinsi Pins, from which it appears that the place

r«: luft received a fresh colony under Nerva. (Orell.

ver. 136; Monunsen, l.c). Scylacium appears

a Live become a considerable town after it received

it l^nun colony, and continued snch throughout

U Roman Empire. (Mel. ii. 4. § 8; Plin. iii. 10.

Ij, l*tol iii. 1. § 11.) Towards the close of this

r-vil it was distinguished as the birthplace of

W 'liiYus, who has left us a detailed but rhetorical

amotion of the beauty of its situation, and fertility

f itk territory. (Cassiod. Var, xii. 15.)

The inouVrn city of SquUlace is a poor place, with

-t ■boot 4000 inhabitant*, though retaining its  
atojtal tee. It stands upon a hilt about 3 miles

*n i.vfiea, a p« wit ion according with the descrip-  
u ;itfn by Ca»*iodonis of the ancient city, but it

[fwuUe that this occupied a site nearer the sea,

fc*r* considerable ruins are said still to exist,

**t ii they hare not been described by any modern

lie SCTLLKTICl-S Sinus (2*»«AAwTtifO» vo'Awos),

Qwtf Sqwllacc, was always regarded as dan-

mi* to mariners; hence Virgil calls it " nav if ra­

ta SeyUajum." (Aen. iii. 553.) There is no

inl port throughout its whule extent, and it

*ir* an evil reputation for shipwrecks. The  
aw » found iu Aristotle us well as Antiochus of

but would seem to have been unknown to

ij'.vitdn; at least it is difficult to explain other­

s' ti* peculiar manner in which he speaks of the

rKwuaa gulf, wLile relating the voyage of Gy-

alofg the E. const of Bruttium. (1 hue. vi.

154.) [E.H.B.]

SCVLAX (3*vAo£), the chief tributary of the

t id I'outus; it had its sources in the east of

ami flowing in a north-western direction,

itmti into the Iris near Eupatoria or Mag-

fat* (Strab. xii. p. 547.) Its modern name is

^teridt Irmak. (Hamilton, Hetearches% vol. i.

2*5.374.) [L. S.]

5CYLLAE {Tab. Pcut.; Geogr. Rav. iv. 6, v. 12),

i»a of Thrace, on the Euxine, where the long

t, erected by the emperor Anastasiu* Dicorus for

d'Cesce of Constantinople, tenninated. This

■ rcunanccd at Selymbria, on the I'ropontis,

»u carried acrc*a the narrow part of Thrace,

'•-<■ dattaace of about 40 miles from Coustan-

fia, ita length being 2 days' journey (Pro-

[J.R.]

CriXAEUM (to XkvMoiov: Scilla), a pro-

ttarytand town or fortress, on the W. coast of

iinm, about 15 miles X. of Rhegium, and

tit exactly at the entrance of the Sicilian strait.

■ ^naiajotory is well described by Strabo (vi.

a* a projecting rocky headland, jutting out

- ' into the aea, an«d united to the mainland by a  
-* nrck or isthmus, so as to form two small hut

- '*i:ered bays, one on each tide. Thei-e can  
• <.>.ubt that this rocky promontory was the one

:j brcarne the subject of bo many fables, and

et was represented by Homer and other poets as

the abode of the monster Scylla. (Horn. Od. xii.

73, &c, 235, &c.; Biogr. Diet. art. Scylla.) But

the dangers of the rock of Scylla were far more

fabulous than those of its neighbour Charybdis, and

it is difficult to understand how, even in the infancy

of navigation, it could have offered any obstacle more

formidable than a hundred other headlands whose

names are unknown to fame. (Senec. Ep. 79;

Smyth's Sicily, p. 107.) At a later period Anaxi-

las, the despot of Rhegium, being struck with the

natural strength of the position, fortified the rock,

and established a naval station there, for the pur­

pose of checking the incursions of the Tyrrhenian

pirates. (Strab. vi. p. 257.) In consequence of this

a small town grew up on the spot; and hence Pliny

speaks of an " oppidum Scyllaeum;" but it was pro­

bably always a small place, and other writer* xpeak

only of the promontory. (Plin. iii. 5. s. 10; Mel. ii.

4. § 8; Ptol. iii. 1. § 9.; Steph. By*, t. V.) At

the present day the rock is still occupied by a fort,

which is a post of considerable strength, while a

small town stretches down the slojjes towards the

two bays. The distance from the castle to the op­

posite point of the Sicilian coast, marked by the

Torre del Faro, is stated by Capt. Smyth at 6047

yards, or rather less than 3£ Eng. miles, but the

strait afterwards contracts considerably, so that its

width between the Pwita del Pezto (Caenys Pnm.)

and the nearest point of Sicily does not exceed 3971

yards. (Smyth's Sicily, p. 108.) [E. H. B.]

SCYLLAEUM (Sai/AAatoi'), a promontory of

Troezenia, and the most easterly point cf the Pelo­

ponnesus, is said to have derived its name from

S-ylla, the daughter of Nisus, who, after betraying

Megara and Nisaea to Minos, was thrown by the

latter into the sea, and was washed ashore on this

promontory. Scyllaeum formed, along with the

opposite promontory of Sunium in Attica, the en­

trance to the Saronic gulf. It is now called Kavo~

Skyli; but as Pausanias, in the paraphis from Scyl­

laeum to Hermione, names Scyllaeum first, and then

Bucephala, with three adjacent islands, it is neces­

sary, as Leake has observed, to divide the extremity

now known as Kavo-Skyli into two parts; the bold

round promontory to the N. being the true Scyl­

laeum, and the acute cape a mile to the S. of it

Bucephala, since the three islands are adjacent to

the latter. (Pans. ii. 34. §§ 7, 8; Scylax. p. 20,

Hudson; Strab. viii. p. 373; Time. v. 53; Plin. iv.

5. s. 9; Mela, ii. 3; Leake, Morta, vol. ii. p. 462,

Peloponnesiuca, p. 282; Bobtaye, Reckerchcsi p. 59;

(Junius, Pelojxmntsos, vol. ii. p. 452.)

SCYROS or SCYRUS (2«Spo»: Eth. 2ici5piof:

Skyro), an island hi the Aegaean sea, and one of the

northern Sporades, was so called from its rugged-

ness. It lay east of Euboea, and contained a town

of the same name (Strab. ix. p. 436; Scylax, p. 23;

Ptol. iii. 13. § 47), and a river called Cephissus.

(Strab. ix. p. 424.) Scyros is frequently mentioned

in the stories of the mythical period. Here Thetis

concealed her son Achilles in woman's attire among

the daughters of Lycomedes, in order to save him

from the fate which awaited him under the walls

I of Troy. (Apollod. iii. 13. § 8; Paus. i. 22. § 6;

| Strab. ix. p. 436.) It was here also that Pyrrhus,

the son ol Deidamia by Achilles, was brought up,

and was fetched from thence by Ulysses to the

Trojan War. (Horn. //. xix. 326, 6d. xi. 507;

Soph. Phil. 239, sea,.) According to another tradi­
