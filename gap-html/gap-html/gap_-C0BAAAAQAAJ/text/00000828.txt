Dion Cass. Iv. 26; Paulas, de Offic. Prwf. VigiL,

Dig. i. 15.) As these stations were necessarily

ne:u- the borders of Regions, we find them frequently

mentioned in the Notitin and Curiotum. They

seem to have been a sort of barracks. But besides

the 7 principal stations, the Breviarium mentions

14 excubitoria, or outposts, which seem to have been

placed in the middle of each region. The corps of

which they were composed were probably supplied

from the main stations. The duties of the visiles

were those of a night-police, namely, to guard against

fires, burglaries, highway robberies, &c. The first

of these duties had anciently been performed by

certain triumviri, called from their functions Noe-

turni, who were assisted by public slaves stationed

at the sates and round the walls. The same office

was, however, sometimes assumed by the aediles

and tribunes of the people. (Paulus, I. c.) The

vigilcs were provided with alt the anns and tools

necessary for their duties: and from a passage in

lYtronius (c. 79) seem to have possessed the ]*>wer

<if breaking into houses when they suspected any

danger. The numbers of the vigiles amounted at

liLst to 70<>0 men. or 1000 in each cohort. Augustus

also established the Cohortes Praetoriae, or imperial

guard, of whicli 9 cohorts were disposed in the

neighbourhood of Rome, and 3 only, the Cohort es

Crbanae, were permitted within the city. (Tac. Aim.

iv. ft; Suet. Aug. 49.) These cohorts of Augustus

were under the command of the Praefectus Urbi.

(Tac. Hist, iii. 04.) It was his successor, Tiberius,

who, by the advice of S-janus, first established a

regular Praetorian camp at Koine, a little to the

eastward of the agger of Servius, and placed the

bands under tlw command of a Praefectus Praetorio.

v lac. Ann. iv. 2; Suet. Tib. 37.)

Augustus also paid considerable attention to the

method of building, and revived the regulations laid

down by P, Rut i lias Kufus with regard to this sub­

ject in the time of the Gracchi (Suet. Aug.B9); but

all we know of these regulations is, that Augustus

forbade houses to be built higher than 70 feet, if

situated in a street. (Strab. v. p, 235.) The

height was subsequently regulated by Nero and

Trajan. i!ie last of whom fixed it at CO feet. (Aur.

Vict. Kpit. c. 13.> Vet houses still continued to

Iv inconveniently high, as we see from the complaints

ot Juvenal, in tin* time, probably, of Domitian, and

dangerous alike in case of fire «.r falling, especially

t»» a poor j^vt who lived immediately under the

tiles: —

(iii. 193.)

Auburn R„mc — Strabo, who visited Rome in

the reign «t Augustus, and must have remained

there during part of that of Tiberius, has left us

the following Uvelv picture of its

that period: The city, having thus

a sise, is able to maintain

of wood and stone for building, which tLf ce-

stant fires and continual falling and pulung

of houses render necessary; for even pu.ii.sg c*»i

and rebuilding in order to gratify the taste a m:

a sort of voluntary ruin. Moreover the a«i*.£ai

mines and forests, and the rivers which sen* »

convey materials, afford wonderful rowans for item

purposes. Such is the Anio, flowing d<*wn frrc Km

(Fucensis), a Latin city lying towards the term m

of the Marsians, and so through the ;.. -

into the Tiber: also the Nar and tin; Te!*a »::

likewise join the Tiber after flowing tliraigii L a-

bria; and tlie Clan is, which waters Eir^r-a aa; ca

territory of Clusium. Augustus Caesar look fast

care to obviate such damages to the city. J:-tmrt

against fires fie appointed a special corps ccw*»»i

of freed men; and to prevent the falling tem *

houses lie ordained that no new ones sbooai W*t&.

if they adjoined the public street*, of a craSf

height than 70 feet. Nevertheless the re&*ar/arf

the city would have been impossible tra: m u»

be fore-mentioned mines and forests,, and tne :*&-o*

of transport.

Although the Greeks are supposed to exai «
