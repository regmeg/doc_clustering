362 Lycophron was deposed by Philip, king of

Macedon, and Pherae, with the rest of Thessaly,

became virtually subject to Macedonia. (For details

and authorities see the Diet of Biogr. under the

respective names above mentioned.)

In B.C. 191 Pherae surrendered to Antiochus,

king of Syria, but it shortly afterwards fell into the

hands of the Roman consul Acilius. (Liv. xxxvi.

9, 14.) Situated at the end of the Pelasgian plain,

Pherae possessed a fertile territory. The city was

surrounded with plantations, gardens, and walled

enclosures. (Polyb. xviii. 3.) Stephanos B. («. v.)

speaks of an old and new Pherae distant 8 stadia

from each other.

In the middle of Pherae was a celebrated fountain

called Hypereia ('TWpeia, Strab. ix. p. 439;

Pind. Pgtk. iv. 221: Sophoel. ap. Schol. ad rind.

L e.; Plin. iv. 8. s. 15.) The fountain Messeis was

also probably in Pherae. (Strab. fat, p. 432; Horn.

IL vi. 457; Val. Flacc ir. 374: Plin. /. e.)

The remains of Pherae are situated at Vtlettlno,

where the ancient walls may be traced on every side

oxcept towards the plain. On the northern side are

two tabular summits, below the easternmost of

which on the southern side is the fountain Hy­

pereia, which rushes from several openings in the

rock, and immediately forms a stream. Apollonius

nays (i. 49; romp. Schol. ad foe.) that Pherae was

situated at the foot of Mt. Chalcodoninm (XoAxeo.

SaVior), which is perhaps the southern and highest

summit of Mt Karadagk. (Leake, Northern

Greta, vol. iv p. 439, seq.)

Stepk. B. t. v.; ♦•a\;a. Pans.: ♦idAfio, Polyb.:

Elk. *it«A*oj, 4>iaAfi/s, ♦ryaAelrny), an ancient

town of Arcadia, situated in the sooth-western cor­

ner of the country, close to the frontiers of Messenia,

and upon the right bank of the Xeda, about half­

way between the sources and the mouth of this river.

The name Phigalia was more ancient than that of

Phialia, but the original name had again come into

use in the time of Pausnnias (viii, 39. § 2). Tho

city was said to have derived its more ancient name

from Phigalns, a son of Lycaon, its original founder,

and its later name from Phialus, a son of Lycaon,

its second founder. (Pans. f. c; Steph. B.) In B.C.

659 the inhabitants of Phigalia were obliged to sur­

render their city to the l.aceilaemonians, but they

recovered possession of it again by the help of a

chosen body of Oresthasians, who, according to an

<)racle, perished fighting against the Lacedaemonians.
