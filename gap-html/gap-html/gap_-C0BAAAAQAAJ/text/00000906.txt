BUpafff, Ixi. 18). Nardini, who is followed by

Canina (Tndirazione, p. 83), is of opinion that the

church of S. Stefano Rotondo was part of the

macellum, perhaps a slaupbter-house with a dome,

and surrounded with porticoes.

MAURLLUM.

The Caatra PEREGniSA recorded in the Notitia

are not mentioned by any author except Ammianos

Marcel I inns, who relates that Chnodomar, when

conquered by Julian, was conducted to and died in

this camp on the Caelian (xvi. 12,extr.) The name,

however, occurs in inscriptions, and sometimes in

connection with a temple of Jupiter Redux, as in

that found in the church of 5. Maria in Domnica

(Gruter, xx'ii. 3; Orell. 1256). These inscriptions

also mention a Piineeps Pcregrinorum, the nature

of whose office we are unacquainted with; but it

seems probable that he was the commander of the

foreign troops stationed in this camp. Near the

same church were found several little marble ships,

apparently votive offerings, and one which stood

a lung while before it gave to the church and to the

surrounding place the name of d> llu Navicetla.

An Isium, or temple of Isis, is mentioned by

Treb. Pollio (XXX. Tyran. 25) on the Caelian, but it

occurs nowhere else. It was probably one of the

many temples erected to this goddess by Carocalla

(Lampr. Carac. 9.) The spring called the Aqua

Mercurii recorded by Ovid near the Porta Oapena

(Fasti, v. 67-'i) was rediscovered by M. Fea in

1828, in the vigna of the Padri Camuldnlesi dt

S. Gregorio. On the Caelian was also the Campls

MahTIALIS in which the E-juiria were held in March,

in case the Campus Marti us was overflowed (Ovid,

Fast. v. 67.'}; Paul. Diac. p. 1G1). Its .situation

rests chiefly on conjecture; but it was probably near

the Latcrun; where the neighbouring church of

S. Gregorio, now S, Maria Imperttir-ice, was called

in the middle ages "in Campo Martio" (Canina,

Indicazkme. p. 84.)

In the Imperial times the Caelian was the resi­

dence of many distinguished Romans; and it is here

that Martial places the " hmina potentiorum" (sii.

8). We have already had occasion to allude to the

House of Claudius Centumalcs on this hill,

which was of such an extraordinary height that the

augurs commanded him to lower it; but this was dur­

ing the Itopublie. Under the Empire we may mention

the HOUSE <>f MamcrrA, a Roman knight of For-

miae, and praefectus fabrum of Caesar in his Gallic

wars, the splendour of which is described by Pliny

(xxxvi. 7). and lampooned by Catullus (xlii. 4).

Here also was the Hoi'SE OF Annus Verus, the

grandfather of Marcus Aurelius, in which that em­

peror was educated, situated near the house of the

Laterani (Jul.Capit, M. Ant. 1.) It apj*ears to have

been surrounded with gardens; and according to the

Italian writer Vacca (Memor. 18) the noble eques-

trian statue of Marcos Aurelius which

Capitol was discovered in a vineyard war tt* viii

residences was the Palace of the Lotejji

characterised by Juvenal (x. 19) as the - er*T»

Plautius Lateranns, whose participat*-* it. N»
