(Kiisscggcr, Reisen, vol. ii. pt. 1. p. 410.) The

village of Mcdinet-Ahoo stands about one third

of a mile S\V. of Koum-el-II attain, uj>on a lofty

mound formed by the ruins of the most splendid

structure in western Thebes. It consisted of two

portions, a temple and a palace, connected with each

other by a pylon and a dromos. The temple was the

work of successive monarch* of the name of Thoth-

mes, and hence has received the name of the Thoth­

meseion. Apparently this site found favour with

the sovereigns of Aegypt in all ages, since, either on

the main building or on its numerous outworks,

which extend towards the river, are inscribed, the

names of Tirhakah the Aethiopian, of Xectanebus,

the last independent king of Aegypt, of Ptolemy

Siter II., and of Antoninus Pius. The original

Thothmeseion comprises merely a sanctuary sur­

rounded by galleries and eight chambers; the ad­

ditions to it represent the different periods of its pa­

tron* and architects. The palace of Kameses—the

southern Rameseion of Chauipollion—far exceeds in

dimensions and the splendour of its decorations the

Thothmeseion. It stands a little S. of the temple,

nearer the foot of the hills. The dromos which

connects them is 265 feet in length. The sculptures

"ii the pylon relate to the coronation of Rameses IV.

and his victories over the Aethiopians. A portion

of I he southern Rameseion seems to have been ap­

propriated to the private uses of the king. The

mural decorations of this portion are of singular in­

terest, inasmuch as they represent Kameses in his

hours of privacy and recreation.

The walls of the southern Rameseion generally

are covered both on the inside and the out with

representations of battles, sacrifices, religious pro­

cessions and ceremonies, relating to the 18tU dy­

nasty. A plain succeeds, bounded by sand-hills

and heaps of Nile-mud. It is variously described

by modern travellers as the site of a race-course,

of a camp or barrack, or an artificial lake, over

which, according to tSir Gardner Wilkinson, the

dead were ferried to the neighbouring necropolis.

Whatever may have been its purpose, this plain is

of considerable extent, being somewhat less than a

mile and half in length, and more than half a mile

in breadth.

The contrast between the portion of Thebes once

crowded with the living, and that which was equally

thronged with the dead, is less striking now, when

the whole city is a desert or occupied only by a few

straggling villages, But under the Pharaohs the

vicinity ot life and death must have been most so­

lemn and expressive. From (Jourtieh to Medmet-

Aboo the Libyan hills, along a curve of nearly

5 miles, are honey-combed with sepulchres, and

conspicuous among them are the Tombs of the

Kings, situated in the valley of Bab-nl-M tlook. The

Theban necropolis is excavated in the native cal­

careous rock. The meaner dead were interred in the

lower ground, where the limestone is of a softer

grain, and more exposed to decomposition by wind

and water. This portion of the cemetery has, ac­

cordingly, fallen into decay. But the upper and

harder strata of the hills are of finer and more dur­

able texture, and hero the priest-caste and nobles

were interred. The tombs of the lower orders are

generally without sculpture, but filled with mum­

mies of animals accounted sacred by the Aegyptians.

A favourite companion in death appears to have Wen

trances to these tombs are rectangular, aod^per c:j

passages which either pierce the rock it s*jv3*

lines, or wind through it by ascending sakio»T>.-

were carefully prepared for the artist. Roajf va­

rious portions were cut out, and their plact Hot«

with bricks and plaster. Their entire sanaa «»

then covered with stucco, on which tbe piiraf.

were designed and highly coloured. The decern.*

are rarely in relief, but either drawn on ib* £*t

in squares of chequer and arabesque work. T*«
