40 milea N. of the Capo di Galio near Palermo, and

60 miles W. of Alicudi, the westernmost of the

and existing remains show that it must have been

so in the time of the Romans also. (Smyth's Sicily,

O'STIA ('Qork: Eth. Ostiensis: Ostia), a city

of Latium, situated at the mouth of the Tiber, from

which position it derived its name. It was on the

left bank of the river, at a distance of 16 miles from

Rome, by the road which derived from it the name

of Via Ostiensis. {Itin. Ant. p. 301.) All an­

cient writers agree in representing it as founded by

the Roman king Ancus Marcius; and it seems

certain that it always retained the position of a

colony of Rome, and was at no period independent.

From its position, indeed, it naturally became the

port of Rome, and was essential to that city, not

only for the purpose of maintaining that naval su­

premacy which it had established before the close of

the regal period, but for securing its supplies of

corn and other imported produce which was carried

up the Tiber. Ancus Marcius at the same time es­

tablished salt-works on the site, which for a long

time continued to supply both Rome itself and the

neighbouring country in the interior with that ne­

cessary article. (Liv. i. 33; Dionys. iii. 44; Cic.

de Rep. ii. 3, 18; Strab. v. p. 232; Flor. i. 4;

Eutrop. i. 5; Fest.p. 197.) Therecan be no doubt

that the importance of Ostia must have continued

to increase with the growing prosperity and power

of Rome; but it is remarkable that we meet with

no mention of its name in history until the period of

the Second Punic War. At that time it appears as

a commercial and naval station of the utmost im­

portance; and was not only the port to which the

com from Sicily and Sardinia was brought for the

supply of Rome itself, as well as of the Roman

legions m the field, but was the permanent station

of a Roman fleet, for the protection both of the

capital, and the neighbouring shores of Italy,

(Liv. xxii. 11,37, 57,xxiii. 38,xxv. 20,xzvii. 22.)

It was at this time still reckoned one of the 11 colo-

niae maritime*;" but on account of its peculiar im­

portance in relation to Rome, it enjoyed special privi­

leges; so that in B.C. 207, when the other maritime

colonies endeavoured to establish a claim to ex­

emption from levies for military service, this was

allowed only in the case of Ostia and Antium; the

citizens of which were at the same time compelled to

be constantly present as a garrison within their own

walls. (Liv. xxvii. 38.) On a subsequent occa­

sion (b. c. 191) they attempted to extend this ex­

emption to the naval service also; but their claim

was at once disallowed by the senate. (W. xxxvi.

3.) Even after the complete establishment of tho

naval power of the Roman Republic, Ostia seems to

have continued to be the usual station of a Roman

fleet: and in B. c. 67 it was there that a squadron,

which had been assembled for the repression of the

Cilician pirates, was attacked by the pirates them­

selves, and the ships either destroyed or taken.

(Cic pro Leg. Alanil. 12; Dion Cass, xxxvi. 5.)

0>tia itself also suffered severely during the

civil wars of Sulla and Mnrius, having been taken

by the latter in n. c. 87, and given tip to plunder

and devastation by his soldiers. (Ajipian, B. C. i.

67; Liv. Epit. lxxix; Oros. v. 19; Flor. iii. 21.

§ 12.)

But its position at tho mouth of the Tiber, as the

I port of Rome, secured it from decay: and so un­
