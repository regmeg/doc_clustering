585), and is said to have been destroyed by the

Dioscuri, who hence derived the surname of Lapersae.

(Strab. viii. p. 364; Slcph. B. ». r. An.) There was

also a mountain in Laconia called Lapcrsa. (Steph.

B. *. v. Aavifxra.') In the later period it was a

place of no importance. Livy speaks of it as "virus

marilimus" (xxxviii. 30), and Pausanias mentions

the ruins of the city on Sit. Asia. Before the walls

lie saw a statue of Hercules, and a trophy erected

over the Macedonians who were a part of Philip's

army when he invaded Laconia; and among tho

ruins he noticed a statue of Athena Asia. The

modem town was near a fountain called Galaco

(PaAoKfiw), from the milky colour of its water, ami

near it was a gymnasium, in which stood an ancient

atatne of Hermes. Besides the ruins of the old town

on Mt Asia, there were also buildings on the two

other mountains mentioned above: on ML Ilium

stood a temple of Dionysus, and on the summit a

temple of Asclepius; and on Mt. Cnacadium a temple

of Apollo Carneius.

Las is spoken of by Polybins (v. 19) and Strabo

(viii. p. 363) under the name of Asine; and hence

it has been supposed that some of the fugitives from

Asine in Argolis may have settled at Las, and given

their name to the town. But, notwithstanding the

statement of Polybins, from whom Strabo probably

copied, we have given reasons elsewhere for believing

that there was no Laconian town called Asine; anil

that the mistake probably arose from confounding

"Asine" with "Asia," on which Las originally stood.

[Asine, No. 3.]

Las stood upon the hill of Pauavd, which is now

crowned by the ruins of a fortress of the middle

ages, among which, however, Leake noticed, at the

southern end of the eastern wall, a piece of Hellenic

wall, about 50 joces in length, and two-thirds of

tho height of the modern wall. It is formed of

polygonal blocks of stone, some fciur feet long and

three broad. The fountain Galaco is the stream

7'urtovresa, which rises between the bill of I'iis-

tard and the village of Karctla, tho latter being one

mile and a half west of Pauavd. (Leake, ilorea,

vol. i. p. 254, seq., p. 276, seq.; Pelopometiaca,

p. 150; Boblaye, lUchrrchei, dv. p. 87; Curtius,

PeLiptmnrtoM, vol. ii. p. 273, seq.)

LASAKA (Aao-afa), a city in Crete, near the

roadstead of the " Fair Havens." (AcU, xxvii. 8.)

This place is nut mentioned by any other writer, but

is probably the same as tho Lisia of tlie Peutinger

Tables, 16 M. P. to the E. of Gortyna. (Comp Hock,

A'rWo, vol. i. pp. 412,439.) Some MSS. have Laseo;

others, Alav-a. The Vulgate reads Thalassa, which

Bexa contended was the true name. (Comp. Coney-

beare and Howson, Life and Epitt. of St. Paid,

vol. ii. p. 3.10.) [E. B. J.]

LA'SION (AturoKK or fuuruir), the chief town of

the mountainous district of Acroreia in Elis proper,

was situated upon the frontiers of Arcadia near Pso-

phis. Curtius places it with great probability in the

upper valley of the Ladon, at the Wmfciilro of

Kuinnni, on the road from the Eleisn Pylos and

Ephyra to Psophis. Lasion wis a frequent object of

dispute between the Arcadian* and Eleians, both of

whom laid claim to it. In the war which the Spar-

tans carried on against Elis at the close of the Pelo-

ponnesian War, Pausanias, king of Sparta, took La­

sion (IHod. xiv. 17). The invasion of Pausanias is

not mrntiorcd by Xenophon in his account of this

war; bat the latter author relate* that, by the treaty

uf |*ace concluded between Elis and Sparta in B.c

400, the Eleians were obliged to give up Lasion, in

cousequence of its being claimed by tbe Arcadians

(Xen. Hell. iii. 2. § 30.) In n. c. 366 the Eleians

attempted to recover Lasion from the Arcadiant;

they took the town by surprise, but were shortly

afterwards driven out of it a„'ain bv the Arcadian*.

(Xen. IM1. vii. 4. § 13, seq.; Diod. xv. 77.) In

B. o. 219 Lasion was again a fortress of Elis. but

upon the capture of Psophis by Philip, the Kleian

garrison at Lasion straightway deserted tbe place.

(Polyb. iv. 72, 73.) Polybins mentions (v. 102)

along with Lasion a fortress called Pyrgos, which he

places in a district named Perippia. (Leake, Morra,

vol. ii. p. 200, soq.; Boblaye. Kec/iercie*. i/-c. p. 12i;
