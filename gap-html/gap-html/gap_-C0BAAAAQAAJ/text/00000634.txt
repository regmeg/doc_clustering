PAPHUS. T A PRE MIS.

denote both Old anil New Paphos, but with this dis­

tinction, that in prose writers it commonly means

New Paphos, whilst in the poets, on the contrary,—

for whom the name of Palaepaphos would have been

unwieldy,— it generally signifies Old PapJtas, the

more peculiar beat nt" the worship of Aphrodite. In

inscriptions, also, both towns are culled Hdtpos.

Tliis iniliscriminato u>,e is sometimes productive of

ambiguity, especially in the Latin prose authors.

Old Paphos, now Kukki or Konuklia (Engel,

Kyprvs, vol. i. p. 125), was said to have been

founded by Cinyras, the father of Adonis (Apollod.

iii. 14); though according to another legend [ire-

served by Stnibo(xi. p. 505),—whose text, however,

varies, — it was founded by the Amazon?. It was

seated on an eminence ("celsa Paphos,"' Virg. A e». x.

51), at the distance of about. 10 stadia, or 1 J mile,

from the sea, on which, however, it bad a roadstead,

it was not far distant from the promontory of Ze-

phyrium (Strab. xiv. p. 683) and the mouth of the

little river Bocarus. (Hesych. *. v. Bwnapos.) The

fable ran that Venus bad landed there when she rose

from out the sea. (Tar. Hist. ii. 3; Mela, ii. 7;

Eucan, viii. 456.) According to Pausanias (i. 14),

her worship was introduced at Paphos from Assyria;

but it is much more probable that it was of Phoe-

nieian origin. [Phoenh'ta.] It had been very

anciently established, and before the time of Homer,

as the prove and altar of Aphrodite at Paphos arc

mentioned in the Odyssey (viii. 362). Mere the

worship "t the goddess centred, not fur Cyprus alone,

but for the whole earth. The Cinyradue. or de­

scendants of Cinyras,—Greek by name, but of Phoe­

nician origin,—were the chief prier-ts. Their power

and authority were very great; but it may be inferred

from certain inscriptions that they were controlled

by a senate and an assembly of the people. There was

also an oracle here. (Kngel.i. p. 483.) l ew cities have

ever been so much sung anil glorified by the p-iets.

(Cf. Aeseh. Sitppl. 525; Virg. Aen. i. 415; Hor.

Vd. i. 19. 30, iii. 25; Stat.&'/c. i.2. 101; Aristoph.

Lysis. 833, &r. &c.) The remains of the vast tem­

ple of Aphrodite are still discernible, its circumfe­

rence being marked by huge inundation walls. After

iu overthrow by an earthquake, it was rebuilt by

Vespasian, on whose coins it is represented, as well

as on earlier and later ones, and especially in the

most perfect style on those of Septimius Severus.

(Engel, vol. i. p. 130.) From these representations,

and from the existing remains, HeUch, an architect!

of Coj**nhagen, has attempted to restore the building.

(Miillor's Arcfuiol. § 239, p. 201; Eckhel, vol. iii.

p. 86.)

New Paphos, now Bnffa, was seated on the sea.

near the western extremity of the island, and pos­

seted a go id barb' ur. It lay about 00 stadia, or

between 7 and 8 miles NW. of the ancient city.

(S:rab. xiv. p. 683.) It was said to have been

founded by Agaj>enor, chief of the Arcadians at the

siege of Troy (Horn. //. ii. 609), who, after the

the capture of that town, was driven by the storm,

which separated the Grecian fleet, on the coast of

Cyprus. (I'aus. viii. 5. § 3.) We find Agapenor

meutioned as king of the Paphians in a Greek dis­

tich preserved in the Atialvcta (i. p. 181, Ltrunk);

anil Herodotus {vii. 90) alludes an Arcadian

colony in Cyprus. Like its ancient namesake, Nea

Paphos was also distinguished for the worship of

Venus, and contained several magnificent temples

dedicated to that gtidd<->s. Vet in this respeet the

old city seems to have always retained the pre­

eminence; and Strabo tells us, in the *•

fore cited, that the road leading to it from )va

Paphos was annually crowded with mak ind

votaries resortin-j to tlie more ancient shnr*. e>1
