SITTACE (SnTcwrn, Ptol. vL 1. § 0), a town of

ancient Assyria, at the southern end of this province,

on the road between Artemita and Susa. (Strab.

xvi. p. 744.) It is called Sitta (2irTa) by l>iodorus

(xvii. 110). It was the capital of the district of

Sittaceue, which apjtears to have been called in later

times Apolloniatis (Strab. xi. p. 524), and which

adjoined the province of Susis (xv. p. 732). Fliny,

who gives the district of Sittacene a mora northerly

direction, states that it bore also the names of Arbe-

litis and Talaestine (vi. 27. s. 31). It is probably

the same country which Cuitius calls Satra|>ene

(v. 2). [V.]

thfl Heroopolite gulf to the straits of Bab-el-Man-

deb, lietween lat. 24° and 25° in this range is

the Mount Sinaragdus, the modern Pjtbvl Kabarth,

which derived its name from the emeralds found

thirre, and early attracted by its wealth the Aegyp-

tians into that ban-en region. The principal mine

was at I>jiltcl-Znbar<h; but at fScnder-el-Soghrir

to N.. and at Sekket to S., each a jwrtion of Slount

Sinaragdus, there are traces of ancient mining ope­

rations. Small emeralds of an inferior quality are

still found in this district. (Mannert, Oroiji-aph.

vol. x. p. 21.) Strabo (xvii. p. 815) and Pliny

(xxxvii. 15. 8. 16) mention the wealth obtained

from these mines. At Stkktt there is a temple of

the Ptolemaic era; but the mines were known and

wrought at least as early as the reign of Amunoph

III., in the 18th dynasty of the native kings of

Aetrvpt. [W. B. I).]

SMYIiNA (S^upfa: Eth. %fj,vpi>aios, Smynmeus:

Smyrna or Izmir), one of the most celebrated and

most flourishing cities in Asia Minor, was situated on

the east of the mouth of the Hei inus, and on the bay

which received from the city the name of the Smyr-

naeus Sinus. It is said to have been a very ancient

town tounded by an Amazon of the name of Smyrna,

who had previously conquered Ephesus. In con­

sequence of this Smyrna was regarded as a colony

of Ephesus. The Ephesian colonists are said after­

wards to have been expelled by Aeolians. who then

occupied the place, until, aided by the Colophonians,

the Ephesian colonists were enabled to re-establish

themselves at Smyrna. (Strab. xiv. p. 633; Steph.

Ji. s. v.; l'lin. v. 31.) Herodotus, on the other hand

(i. 150), states that Smyrna originally belonged to

the Aeolians, who admitted into their air -

Colophonian exiles; and that these Cd

afterwards, during a festival which'

outside the town, made themselves mutm af 1
