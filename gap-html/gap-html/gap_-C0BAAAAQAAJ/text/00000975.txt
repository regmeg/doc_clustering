SAMAICA. SAMARIA, SEBASTE. 887

Mmh fint brought the Romans into the country

(tW Salyei; and in B.C. 154 the Oxybii nnd

venVs, or Deciates, who were threatening Massilia,

mt deialM by the consul Q. Opimius. The

or Stllorii are not named on this occasion by

■ birtnan*, and the Deceates and Oxybii, who

nr* certainly Ligurians, may have been two smaller

ifm rocloJed under the general name of Salyes or

iflarii. [Deciatks; Oxybii.] The consul M.

aUiua Flireue in B.C. 125 defeated the Salves,

)i a a.c. 123 the consul C. Sextius Calvinus

Hjpletri the subjugation of this people, and founded

QM SeitUe (Aix) in their territory.

froicmy (ii. 10. § 15) enumerates Tarascon,

bourn, Arelatum (Arelate) Colonia, Aquae Sex-

■r Gjionia, and Ernaginum as the towns of the

irn*. Tarascon, Glanum (St. Remi), Arelate, and

Surinam [Ea-f aoinvm] all lie west of Aquae

itat (Aix) and of Marseille; and we may con-

i '* 'hat the country of the Salves is the western

i* <V tbt tract between the Var and the tthone,

a tetween ibe Durance and the Mediterranean.

Tie tribes east of the Salyea, the Albici, Suetri,

nsi. Oxybii, and Deciates, and there may be

at <*hm [Commom]. were perhaps sometimes

Wed tader the name of the more powerful nation

iat>*lyes; but Strabo's statement does not ap-

* to be strictly correct, when he makes the Sa-  
tatrad along the coast to Antipolis. The coast

s»calely went of the Var belonged to the Dece-

i a4 Oxybii. Pliny says " Ligurium celeberrimi

» Alpw, Salluvii, Deciates, Oxybii " (iii. 5); the

■ tnfces of Transalpine Ligures whose names occur

-w history of the tinman conquestof this country,  
a Pliny's Iwt of the Coloniae in the interior of

kmnus east of the Khone there is "Aquae

:^ Sadluvinrum,** and we may conclude that the

*^wtm of the Solves or Sallurii were in  
r*an» coon try above Air. and thence to Aries.

V 'J tbeir proximity to the Greeks of Massilia

»wld be the first of the Ligures or the mixed

T« rroxaed by Greek blood. Possessing the

af Arelate, at the head of the delta of tbe

m tave and unfortunate people is swallowed up

-* blood-stained annals of Rome; and the race

jrv&iWy nearly extirpated by the consul Cal-

»-riling them after his conquest. [G. L]

LHAICA (3o/*o«ri Ptol. iii. 11. § 9). is dc-

LKACHOXmS LACUS (So^x""™ *Wrj

•-HiwiTii), the name given by Josephus to

ndl lake of the Upper Jordan, called in Scrip-

tie "waters of Merom," where Joshua routed

nay of Jabin, king of Hazor, which city, accord-

> Jeepbua, was situated above the lake. (Comp.

ii. 5, 7, and J wig. iv. with Josephus, Ant. v.

1 ) He eUewbere describes the lake as 60

i k^ig by 30 broad, extending its marshes to a

oiled Daphne, which Beland is probably right

••nag to Dane, i. e. Dan, as Josephus ira­

tely ideothVs it with the temple of the Golden

(Joseph. B. J. iv. 1. § 1; Keland, Paiaest.

The name, which is not elsewhere found,

>« variously derived, but the most probable

*^ty would connect it in :*ense with the He-

aaaa Merom = aqtese svperiorts, deriving the

word from the Arabic ** samaca," altus Juit (Iceland,

/. c. p. 262.) It is singular that no other notices

occur of this lake in sacred or in other writings. Its

modern name is BaJir-el-fluleh. Pocoeke writes:

"Josephus says the lake was 7 miles long, but it is

not above 2 miles broad, except at the north end,

where it may be about 4. The waters are muddy

and esteemed unwholesome, having something of the

nature of the water of a morass." (Observations on

Palaestine, vol. ii. p. 73.) Dr. Robinson ** estimated

its length at about 2 hours, or from 4 to 5 geo­

graphical miles; its breadth at the northern end is

probably not less than 4 miles." It had the ap­

pearance almost of a triangle, tho northern part being

far the broadest; "or rather the map gives to it in

some degree the shape of a pear." (BibL Res. vol.

iii. pp. 339, 340, Biblioth. Sacr. vol. i. p. 12; Stan-

lev, Sinai and Palestine, p. 383, n. 1.) [G. W.]

"SAMAMYCII. [Syrtica.]

SA'MARA. [Frtjdis; Samarobriva. ]

SAMA'RIA (5aua/)f?7n, LXX., Joseph.; x^P°

5ajuan«W, 2aua^K, Hauapaa, Ptol.). The district

has been already described in general, under Pa-

larsttna (p. 518], where also the notice of Jo­

sephus has been cited [p. 532]. It remains to add

a few words concerning its extent, its special cha­

racteristics, and its place in classical geography. It

lay, according to Josephus, "between Judaea and

Galilee (comp. St. John, ir. 4), extending from a

village called Ginaea in the great plain (Esdraelon)

to the toparchy of Acrabalta." Ginaea there can be

no difficulty in identifying with the modern Jenin,

at the southern extremity of the plain, on the raid

from Nablus to Nazareth. The toparchy of Acra-

batta, mentioned also by Pliny, it is difficult to de­

fine: but it certainly lay between Nablus and Jericho,

and therefore probably east of the toparchy of Gophna

and in the same parallel of latitude. (Eusebius,

Onomast. s. v. *Aitf>a€€t Iv; Ilelaml, Paiaest. p.

192.) The northern boundary of Samaria is well de­

fined by a continuous line of hills, which, commencing

with Mount Carmel on the W., runs first in a SW.

direction and then almost due K. to the valley of the

Jordan, bounding the great plain of Esdraelon on the

S. Its southern boundary is not so distinctly

marked, but was probably conterminous with the

northern limits of the tribe of Benjamin. It com*

prehended the tribe of Ephraim.and the half of Ma-

nasseh on this side Jordan, and, if it be extended as

far E. as Jordan, included also some part of I>*a-

char, that skirted these two tribes on the E. Pliny

(v. 13) reckons to Samaria the towns Neapolis, for­

merly called Mamortha, Sebnste, and Gamala, which

last is certainly erroneous. [Gamala.] Ptnletny

names Neapolis and Thena (©^a, v. 16. § 5), which

last is evidently identical with Thanath (Oa^Af) of

the tribe of Joseph, mentioned by Eusebius (Ono-

mast s. r.), and still existing in a village named

Thena, 10 miles E. of Neapolis, on the descent to the

Jordan. St. Jerome notes that the most precious

oil was produced in Samaria (in Hoseam, cap. xii.),

and its fertility is attested bv Josephus. [G. W.]

Hebrew Siiomrox, the capital city of the kingdom

of Israel, and the royal residence from the time of

Omri (cir. B.C. 925). of whom it is said that

"he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two

talents of silver, and built on the hill, and called

the name of the city which he built after the name

of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria" (Heb. She>
