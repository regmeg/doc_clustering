MURGIS. .177 MUTIXA.

the Hirpini, about 20 miles W. of Luceria. An

inscription found here would Beem to attest that

Hurrintia existed as a municipal town as late as

the reign of Severus; but considerable doubts have

been raised of its authenticity. (Komanelli, vol. ii.

p. 481; Mommsen, Topogrufia degli Irpini, pp.4,

5: in BulL dtJT I tut. Arch. 184S.) The coins,

with an Oscan legend, which have been generally

attributed to Murgantia, in reality belong to Teatc.

(Friedhuider, Otkuche Mirnzen, p. 49.)

2. A city of Sicily, the name of which is variously

written Murgantia, Murgentia, and Morgantia. [Mor­

gan™.] [E. H. B.]

MURGIS (Mou/ryfs), a town of Hispania Baetica,

near the frontiers of Tarraconensis, and on the road

from Castulo to Malaca, probably near Puenta de

la Guar (tin rieja. (Ptol. ii. 4. §11; l'lill. iii. 3.

s. 4; I tin. Ant. p. 405 j Ukert, ii. 1. p. 352;

Forbiger, iii. p. 56.)

MURIAXE (Moi/pioKjj), one of the four districts

of C&taonia in Cappadocia, on the west of Laviane-

sane, and south-west of Melitene. It is mentioned

only by Ptolemy (v. 7. § 8), and must not be con­

founded with Morimene. [L. S.]

MURIUS (J/uAr), a tributary of the Brave

(Dravus), which is mentioned only in the Pcuting.

Table, though the antiquity of the name is un­

doubted, and attested by the station " in Murio," which

was situated on the road leading from Augusta

Vindelicornm through Noricum. (Muchar, Aori-

amm. I p. 280.) [L. S.]

MUROCINCTA, an imperial villa in Pannonia,

where Valentinian II. was residing with his mother

Jostina, when he was proclaimed emperor. (Amm.

Marc. xxx. 10.)

MCRSA or MU'RSIA (MoG/wro, Kovptria), also

cmlled Mursa Major, to distinguish it from Mursella

(Mersella) or Mursa Minor, was an important Roman

colony, founded by Hadrian in Lower Pannonia, and

bad the surname Aelia. It was the residence of

the governor of the country, on the Dravus, and there

the roads met leading from Aquincum, Celeia, and

Poetovio. In its neighbourhood, Gallienus gained a

victory over Ingebus; and Constantine the Great

made the town the seat of a bishop, A.D. 338. Its

modern name is Eaek, the capital of Slavonia.

The Lesser Mursa (Mursa Minor or Mursella)

was likewise situated in Lower Pannonia, ten miles

to the west of Mursa Major, on the road from this

latter place to Poetovio, near the modern village of

Petmtcicz, on the right bank of the Danube, (l'tol.

MURSELLA [Morsa.]

MURUS CA'ESARIS. [Helvetii, vol. i. p.

MUSAGORES (Motrndyopoi, Pomp. Mela, ii. 7.

§ 13), three islands lying off the E. coast of Crete,

the position of which is described by Pliny (iv. 12.

8.20): "Circumvectis Criumctopon, trcs Musagorcs

appeUatae." In Mr. Pashley's map they are repre­

sented by Elaphonesia. (Comp. Hock. Kreta, vol. i.

p. 378.) [E. B.J.]

MUSARNA (Movadpra, Ptol. vi. 21. § 5, vi. 8.

J9; Marcian. Peripl. 29—32,«p.Geogr.Graec. Min.

ed. Muller, 1855), a spot on the shore of Gedrosia,

as may be inferred from the comparison of the au-

thorities. Ptolemy mentions two places of the name

one in Gedrosia, and the other in Caramania; but

there can be no doubt that the same place is in­

tended. Arrian speaks of a place which he calls va

MoTapva, on the coast of Gedrosia, which was occu­

pied by the Ichthyophagi (Indie. 26). Vincent, who

has examined this geographical question with much

care, thinks that this port must have been situated

a little west of the modern cape Passenee or Pasniee.

(Voyage of A'earchus, vol. i. p. 242.) The differ­

ence of position in the ancient geographers may be

accounted for by the fact that Musarna must have

been on the boundary between Gedrosia and Cara­

mania. Ptolemy speaks of a tribe, whom he calls

Musarnaei (KovtrapvaToi, vi. 21. § 4). There can

be little doubt that they were the people who lived

around Musarna. [V.]

MUSO'NES (Amm. Marc. xxix. 5. § 27; Moo-

aowoi, Ptol. iv. 3. § 24; Mussini, Plin. v. 4.

8. 4; Musunii, Pevt. Tab.}, a Moorish tribe, who

joined in the revolt of Firmns. (Amm. Marc. I. c.;

comp. St. Martin, Le Beau, Bas Empire, vol. iii.

p. 475.) [E. B. J.]

MUSTI (Mouo-t^, Ptol. iv. 3. § 33), a town of

Numidia, which the Antonine Itinerary places at 34

M. P. (32 M. P. Pent. Tab.) from Sicca Veneria,

92 M. P. from Sufetula, 86 M. P. from Carthage,

119 M. P. (by Tipasa) to Cirta; all which distances

(considering that the roads are indirect) agree with

the position assigned to it by Shaw (7'rar. p. 179)

and llarth (W'andernngen, p. 221) at 'Abd-er-

Rabbi, so called from the tomb of a "Marabout.'*

According to Vibius Sequester (de Flum. p. 7),

it was near the river Bagradas; but Shaw (/. a),

who first discovered the site, by the remains of a

triumphal arch, and a stone with an inscription

bearing the ethnic name "Musticensinm,'' speaks of

it as being at some distance from the present course

of the Mejerdah. [E. B. J.]

MUSULA'MII (Tac. Ann. ii. 52, iv. 24; Mio-ou-

Kauot, Ptol. iv. 3. § 24; Misulanii, I'eut. Tab.),

a Moorish tribe, whom Ptolemy (I. c.) places to the

S. of Cirta, at the foot of Audum. Tacitus (/. c.)

gives them a more westerly position, and describes

the defeat of this powerful tribe under Tacfarinas,

their leader. [E. B. J.]

MUTE'NUM, a place in Upper Pannonia, on the

road from Vindobona to Celeia, and probably occu­

pying the same site as the modern Muzon. (It.

Ant. pp. 233, 266; Cluver, Vitukl. 5.) [L. S.]

MUTI1UL, a river of Numidia, which, from its

being in the division belonging to Adherbal, must be

looked for towards the E. of that country. (Sail.

Jug. 48.) [E. B.J.]

MU'TIXA (Mnvrlvn, Strab.; Mo-rim, Pol.;

Moimpo, Ptol.: Eih. Mutiuensis: Modena), an im­

portant city of Gallia Cispadana, situated on the Via

Aemilia, between Purina and Bononia. It was

35 miles distant from the former, and 25 from

the latter city. (Strab. v. p. 216; I tin. Ant.

p. 127; //in. liter, p. 616.) It appears to luive

certainly existed previous to the conquest of this

part of Italy by the Romans, and was not impro­

bably of Etruscan origin. Livy tells us, that the

district or territory in which it was situated, was

taken from the Boians, and had previously belonged

to the Etruscans (Liv. xxxix. 55); but he does

not mention the city. Nor do we know at what

period the latter fell into the hands of the Romans,

though it was probably during the Gaulish War

(B.C. 225—222), as we find it in their undisturbed
