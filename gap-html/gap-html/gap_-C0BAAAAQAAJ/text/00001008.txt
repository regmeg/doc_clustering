applies to one of these. Then were more of them.

The general rule, however, is, that some particular

division of the name takes historical prominence,

ami that the general name of Sarmatia, as well

M the particular Sarmaiae of the parts between

D&cia and Pannouia, and those between Scythia

and Persia, disappears. [See Vandali; Thai fa-

lab.] [R. G. L.]

SARMATICA I'NSULA, an island at that

month of the Danube called Kalonstoma (to koAov

o-T((Ma). (PHn. iv. 24. s. 24.) [T. H. 1).]

SARMA'TICAE PORTAE (at 2a^a™c>l *v-

Aai, Ptol. V. 9. 11, 15), a narrow pass of the

Caucasus, whence it is also called Caueasiae Portae.

I PHn, vi. 11. s. 12, 15. h. 15.) From its vicinity

lo the Caspian sea, it was also called by some of the

ancients Portae Caspiae (Suet. Aero, 19), Claustm

Caspiarnm (Tac. //. i. G), and Via Caspia (Id. Ann.

vi. 33)i but Pliny (/. e.) note* this as an error; and

the proper Portae Caspiae were in the Taurus

(Forbiger, Geogr. vol. ii. p. 47, note 92). The Sar-

maticae Portae formed the only road between Sar-

matia and Iberia. Ptolemy (/. c.) distinguishes

from this pass another in the same moon tain, which

he calls ciJ 'W€di'iat riyAai (Porta*; Albaniae), and

places the latter in the same latitude as the former,

namely the 47th degree, but makes its longitude 3

degrees more to the E. The Albaniae Portae are

those on the Alazon, leading over the mountain from

Derbatd to Berdnn. At both spots there are still

traces of long walls 120 feet in height; and on this

circumstance seems lo have been founded a legend,

prevalent in that neighbourhood, of the Bitot Sea

and the Caspian having been at one time connected

by such a wall. (Forbiger, /bid. p. 55. note 13, b.;

comp. Hitler, Erdkw&s, ii. p. 837.) [T. H- D.]

SARMA'TICI MONIES (Jap^nica S>n), a

range of mountains on the eastern frontier of Ger­

many, mentioned only by Ptolemy (ii. 11. § 6, viii.

10. § 2). according to whom it appears to have ex­

tended north of the Danube as far as the sources

of the Vistula, and therefore consisted of the

mountains in Moravia and a part of the Car­

pathian*. [L. S.]

SARMA'TICITM MARE(d 2aPju«™os 2»kw6^

Ptol. vii. 5. 2, 6), a sea in the N. of Europe,

washing the coast of Sarmatia, and which must

thus have been the Baltic (Tac. Germ. 45). But

sometimes the Black Sea is designated by the poets

under this name, as by Ovid {ex Putt. iv. 10. 38)

and by Valerius Flaccus (Sanitations Pontus, viii.

207 ) [T. H. 1).]

SARMATINA, a town of Ariana, mentioned by

Aminianos (xxiii. 6). It is probably the same as

the Sarraagana of Ptolemy (vi. 17. § 4), as both he

and Ammianus place it next to Bitaxa, in the same

province. [V.]

SARMIZEGETHITSA (Zaput&ytOovfra, Ptol.

iii. 8. § 9: Zff>,ui£f*Y€fW<Ti7t l*i.»n Cass. 1 viii.. 9), one

of the most considerable towns of Dacia, and the

residence of the Dacian kings (fiaaiKaov, Ptol. /. c.)

It is called Sarmategte in the Tabula PeuL, and Sar-

nuuege by the Geogr. Rav. (iv. 7). It is incontes-

tably tlie same place as that called ret QaaiAtta Aokwv

by Dion Cassius (Ixvii. 10; )xviii. 8), who places it

on the river Sargetia (M. c. 14); a situation which

is also testitied by ruins and inscriptions. At a

later period a Roman colony was founded here by

Trajan, after he had expelled and killed Decebalus

king of the Dacians; as is testified by its name of

Colonia Ulpia T raj ana Augusta, and may be inferred

from Ulpian (/)/</. 50. tit. 15.1 \.\ (nun whom*

also learn that it possessed the Jus lialiraa. It

was the head-quarters of the Legio xm.

(Dion Cass, lv. 23), and at first probably

only a Roman encampment here (Id. Win. 9;

Vict. Caa. xiiL 4). Hadrian conferred inaasnfca

upon it, as appears from an inscription (Onus, a.

177. 3; Orelli, No. 812), and that empenr taatfjf
