STRATUS (%rp6.ros: l.th. 2TpdTios: its ter­

ritory 7; IrpariK-i); Suroviylt), the chief town of

Acarnania, was situated in the interior of the country,

in a fertile plain on the right bank of tlie Achelous.

It commanded the principal approaches to tlie plain

from the northward, and was thus a place of great

military importance. Strabo (x. p. 450) places it 200

stadia from the month of the Achelous by the course

of (he river. At the distance of SO stadia S. of the

town the river Anapus flowed into the Achelous;

and 5 Roman miles to its X.. the Achelous received

another tributary stream, named Petitanrus. (Time,

ii. 82; Liv xliii. 22.) Stratus joined the Athenian j

alliance, with most of the other Acarnunian towns,'

at the commencement of the Peloponnesian \\ ar. in

B.C. 429 it was attacked by the Ambraciots, with a

number of barbarian auxiliaries, aided by some Pelo­

ponnesian troops, under the command of Cnemus;

but they were defeated under the walls of Stratus,

and obliged to retire. Thucydides describes Stratus I

at that time as the chief town of Acarnania, which \

it is also called by Xenophon in his account of the

expedition of Agosilaus into this country. (Time. |

ii. 80, sen,., iii. 106; Xen. Hell iv. 6.) 'When the

Aetolians extended their dominions. Stratus fell into |

the hands of this people, whence it is called by Livy

a town of Aetolia. It is frequently mentioned

during the Macedonian and Roman wars. Neitiicr

Philip V. nor his successor Perseus was able to |

wrest the town from the Aetolians; and it remained I

in the power of the latter till their defeat by the I

Romans, who restored it to Acarnania, together with

the other towns, which the Aetolians had taken from

the Acarnanians. (Polyb. iv. 63, v. 6, 7, 13, 14, 96;

Liv. xxxvi. 11, xliii. 21, 22.) Livy (xliii. 21) gives

an erroneous description of the position of Stratus

when he says that it is situated above the Auibra-

cian gulf, ik-ar the river Inachus.

There are considerable remains of Stratus at the

modern village of SurovUjli The entire circuit of

the city was about 2i miles. The eastern wall

followed the hank of the river. Leake discovered

the remains of a theatre situated in a hollow: its

interior diameter below is 105 feet, and then; seem

to have been about 30 rows of seats. (Leake,

Northern Greece, vol. i. p. 137, seq.)
