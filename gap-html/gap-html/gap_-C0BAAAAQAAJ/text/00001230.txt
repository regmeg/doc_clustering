1144 TUEBAE AEGYPTL THEBAE AEGYPTI.

Tlicbes was indebted for its greatness originally to

its being the principal centre of Ammon-worship,—a

worship which, on the one hand, connected it with

Meroe, and, on the other, with the islands of the

Libyan desert. The strength which the Thebaic!

and its capital thus acquired not only enabled it to

rise superior to Abydus in the earlier period, but also

to expel the Assyrian invaders from the Delta. It

heroines then an interesting question which quarter

of Thelitis was its cradle? Did it spread itself from

the eastern or the western shore of the Nile? Both

Diodorus and Strabu are agreed in placing the "old

town," wiili its Aiuinonian temple, on the eastern

bank of the river; and this site too was the more acces­

sible of the two, whether its population came from

the left or, as it is more likely they did. from the

right shore. Between Luxor and Karnak lies the

claim to be considered as the site of the earliest

Diospolis. Now in the former place there is 110 con­

spicuous trace of Amnion - worship, whereas the

latter, in its ram-headed dromoi, abounds with sym­

bols of it. At Knntak, every monument attests the

presence of Amnion. Osiris indeed appears as hi?

son or companion on the sculptures, and in some of

the temple-legends they were represented as joint

founders of the shrine. But Amnion was without

doubt the elder of the two. We may accordingly

infer that the tirst Thebes stood nearly on the site ,

■if the present Kumak, at a period anterior to all

record: that it exjianded towaids the river, and was

M'parated by the whole breadth of the stream and of

the plain to the foot of the Libyan hills from the

necropolis. Finally, that as its population became

large for the precincts of the eastern plain, a

suburb, which grew into a second city, arose on the

upjwsite bank of the Nile; and thus the original

distinction between eastern and western Thebes par­

tially disappeared, and the river, having thencefor­

ward habitations on both its banks, no longer parted

by a broad barrier the city of the living from the city

of the dead.

The territory of Thebes was named Thebais (ij

OnSafy, sc. X^P0^ or °* &vta t6ttoi} the Upper

Country, Ptol. iv. 5- i$ 62), the modern *Sai> or

J>athrvs} and was olio of the three principal divi­

sions of Aegypt. Its frontiers to the S. varied ac­

cordingly as Aegypt or Aethiopia preponderated, the

Thebau Pharaohs at times ruling over the region

above the Cataracts as far S. as Hiera Sycaniina

lat. 23'-* 6' N.; while, at others, the kings of Meroe

planted their garrisons N. of Syene, and, at one

period, occupied the Thebais itself. But the ordi­

nary limits of Upper Aegypt were Syene to S., lat

24° 5' X., and Hcnnopolis Magna to N., lat. 27° 45'

X. On the K. it was bounded by the Arabian, on

the W. by the Libyan hills and desert. Aa rain

seldom falls in the Thebais (Herod, iii. 10), and as

it.^ general surface is rocky or sandy, the breadth of

i-nitivable laud depends on the alluvial deposit of the

Nile, and this again is regulated by the conformation

of the banks on either side. For a similar cause

the ]»optilation of the Thebais was mostly gathered

into towns and large villages, both of which are

often dignified by ancient writers with the appella­

tion of cities. But numerous cities were incom­

patible with the physical character of this region,

and its population must have been cs^iM

below the estimate of it by the Greeks an:

The Thebais was divided into ten iwaw; y.rV :r .
