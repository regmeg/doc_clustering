diameter being 513 feet externally and 248 inter­

nally; tlie smaller one, 410 feet externally and 147

feel internally. The banks or rows of seats are at

present 45 in number, but, from the repairs ami al­

terations which the building has undergone, it is

not certain whether this was the original number.

It is estimated that it would afford seats for about

22,000 persons.

There are also a few remains of a Roman theatre,

on the left bank of the Adige, at the foot of the bill

immediately under the castle of S. PUtro It ap­

pears from two decrees of king Berengarius, dated in

895 and 913, that the theatre was then regarded as

of the highest antiquity, and had in great part gone

to ruin ; on which account its destruction was al­

lowed. (Descriz. di Verona, pt. w. p. 108, so/].)

We have already alluded to tin' ancient gate called

the Porta <Ie Borsurt. It is evidently older than

the walls of Gallicnus, the elevation of winch in the

spate of 8 mouths is recorded upon it; since a pre­

vious inscription has been erased in order to make

room for the new* one. It is a double gate, of a

very florid style of architecture, concerning the me­

rits of which architects have held widely different

opinions. The walls of Gallienua, to judge of them

from the vestiges which still remain, were of a con­

struction sufficiently solid, notwithstanding the

shortness of the time in which they were erected.

The other remains of antiquity at Verona, as the

Porta de1 Leoni, the baths, &c, do not require any

particular description in this place.

The chief works on Verona and its antiquities are

the splendid ones of Count Scip. MafFei, entitled

Verojut IUusti'afa, and Museum Veronense. Onu-

phrius Panvinius also described its remains (Autiq.

Veron. lib. viii. Pat lGtiS). Some account of

them will likewise be found in the Deser&ione di

Verona e delta sua Provincia, by Giovambatista da

VERRUCINI, a Gallic people near the Alps in

the Provincia. Pliny (iii. 4) says: "Itegio Cama-

tullicorum, dein Suelteri, supraque Verrucini.*1

[Camatuluci; SuBLTKlti.] There is nothing to

guide us in fixing the position of the Verrucini, ex­

cept their position with respect to these two other

tribes, and the fact that there is a place named

Verignon, between Draguignan and Itiez. l)ra-

guignnn is in the depaitinent of Var, and Riez is on

the site of Reii [Rkii ApolmnahesJ. [G.L.]

VERRUGO or VERRUCA (*E#awM,Diod.: Colle

lurro?), a town or fortress in the territory of the

Volsci, which is repeatedly mentioned during the wars

of the Romans with that people. The name first occurs

in B.C. 445, when we are told that the place had

been recently occupied and fortified by the Romans,

evidently as a post of offence against the Volscians;

u proceeding which that people resented so much that

it became the occasion of a fresh war. (Liv. iv. I.)

We do not know at what period it fell again into the

hands of the Volscians, but in n. c. 409 it was re­

covered and again garrisoned by the Romans. (/&.

55, 56; Diod. xiv. 11.) It, however, fell once more

into the hands of the Volscians in b. c. 407 (Liv.

iv. 58), and apparently continued in their possession

till B.C. 394, when it was again occupied with a

garrison by the military tribune C. Aemilius, but

lost soon after in consequence of the defeat of

his colleague Sp. Post u mi us. (Liv. t. 28; Di<<d.

xiv. 1)8.) From this time it wholly disappears from

history. It is very doubtful whether it ever was a

1 town, the manner in which it is mffltitwdVrLrr,

in connection with the Arx Carventane, vrt^z *j

prove that it was a mere fort or stna^b ^i, ^-i

soncd and fortified, on account of its natural ckt-

and advantageous position. Its site emtot be su­

mmed with any certainty, but from the turrv firj

there can be no doubt that it was situated e t in­

jecting knoll or peak; hence its sit* at- r«*-
