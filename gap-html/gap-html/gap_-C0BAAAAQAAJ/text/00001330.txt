TVDK. [Tude.]

TYLK (Tv\n, Polyb. iv. 46), a town of Thrace,

on the coast of the Euxine, where the Gauls esta­

blished a seat of government (^curtAfioi'). and which

Reichard identifies with Kilios. Steph. B. (p. G70)

calls it Ti'-Ais, and places it on the Haemus. [J. R ]

TVLISSUS. a town of Crete (Plin. iv. 20), the

position of which can only lie conjecture*!. On its

ancient coins are found on the reverse a young man

holding in his right hand the head of an ibex or

wild gout, and in his left a bow. Theise types on

the coins of Tylissus led the most distinguished

numismatist of the last century (Kckhcl, vol- ii. p.

321) to fix its situation somewhere between Cydonia

and Klvrus, the bow being common on the coius of

the one, and the ibex's head on those of the other, of

these two cities. Hock (Kreta. vol. i. p. 433) and

Torres V. Ribera (Periplus Cretae, p. 324) adopt

this suggestion of Eckhel, and place Tylissus on the

kS. coast at tlie W. extremity of the island near the

modern &}lino~Kast>'ti. (l'ashlev, Trarelji, vol. i.

p. 162.) [E. B.J.]

TYLUS or TYRTJS (TvKos. Ptol. vi. 7. § 47;

Tvpos, Strab. xvi. p. 766; Steph. B. s. v.), an

island in the Persian gulf, oft' the const of Arabia.

It has been already mentioned that according to

some traditions, this island was the original seat of

the Phoenicians, who named the city of Tyre after

it when they bad settled on the coasts of the

Mediterranean. [Phoenicia, p. 607.] PJinr de­

scribes tlie island as abounding in jh-uHs. (Plin.

vi. 28. s. 32, xii. 10. s. 21. xvi. 41. s. 80; Arrian,

Anab. vii. 20; Theophr. Hist. Plant, iv. !), v.

TYMANDl'S (Tu,uai>5os: Kth. TvuavBr)v6s), a

place in Phrygia, between Phiiomeliuni and Sozo-

polis. (Cone. Chedced. pp. 244, anil 247: in this

passage the lending MavSjivwv ttoAis is corrupt;

Hierocl. p. 673, wliere the name is mis writ ten

TuuarS^o?.) It is ]>i>s>iIde that Tymandus may be

the same as the Dymas mentioned by I.ivy (xxxviii.

15), for which some MSS. liave iJiums or I)i-

uias. [L. S.]

TYMBRES. a tributary of the Sangarius, in the

north of Phrygia (Liv. xxxviii. 18), is in all pro­

bability the same river as the one called by Pliny

(vi. 1) Tembmgius, which joined the Sangarius, as

Livy says, on the borders of Phrygia and Galatia,

and, flowing in the plain of Dorylaeum, separated

Phrygia Epictetus from Phrygia Salutaris. It seems

also to bo the same river as the Thvaris and Bathys

mentioned in Bvzantme writers. (Cinnamus, v. 1. p.

Ill ; Richter,iraZ//«/tr(«il p. 522. foil.) [L. S.]

TYMPHAKA, TYMPHAEI. [Ttmphk.]

TYMPHE (Tvix(f>T}')! a mountain on the confines

of Macedonia, Kpeirns, and Thessaly, a part of the

range of Pindus, which gave its name to the district

Tvmi'Haka (Tviupala), and to the people, the Tym­

phaei (TV,uf>ao3i. Steph. B. s. v.). As it is stated

that the river Arachthus rose in Mt. Tymphe, and

that Aeginium was a town of the Tymphaei (Strab.

vii. pp. 325, 327). Mt. Tymphc may be identified wiilt

the summits near Metzovo, and the Tymphaei may

be regarded as the inhabitants of the whole of the

upper valley of the Peneins from Metzovo or Kal<i-

bdka. The name is written in some editions uf

tStrabo, Stymphe and Stymphaei, and the form Stvm-

phaea also occurs in Arrian (i. 7); but the ortho­

graphy without the s is perhaj* to l>c preferred. The

question whether Strmpbalis or &rmp4aSi i ji
