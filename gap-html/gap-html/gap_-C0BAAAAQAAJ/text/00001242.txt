1156 TIir.MISCYEA. THELPUSA.

situated upon the left or eastern bank of the river

Ladon. Its territory was bounded on the north by

that of Psophis, on the south by that of Heraea, on

the west by the Eleia and Tisatis, and on the east by

that of Cleitor, Tripolis, and Theisoa. The town is

said to have derived its name from a nymph, tlie

daughter of the river Ladon, which nymph was pro­

bably the stream flowing through the lower part of

the town into the Ladon. It is first mentioned in

history in b. c. 352, when the Lacedaemonians were

defeated in its neighbourhood by tlie Spartans.

(I)iod. xvi. 39.) In b. c. 222 it was taken by An-

tigonus Doson, in the war against Cleomenes, anil it

is also mentioned in tlie campaigns of Philip. (Po-

lyh. ii. 54, iv. 60, 73, 77; Steph. B. s. v. Ts\<povaa;

Plin. iv. 6. s. 20.) Its coins show that it belonged

to the Achaean League. (Leake, Ptloponnesiaca,

p. 206.) When Pausanias visited Thelpusa, the city

was nearly deserted, so that the agora, which was

formerly in the centre of the city, then stood at its

extremity. He saw a temple of Asclepius, and an­

other of the twelve gods, of which the latter was

nearly levelled with the ground. (Pans. viii. 25

§ 3.) Pausanias also mentions two temples of some

celebrity in the neighbourhood of Thelpusa, one

above and the other below the city. The one above

was the temple of Demeter Eleusinia, containing

statues of Demeter, Persephone and Dionysus, made

of stone, and which probably stood at the castle op-

p'Mtc to Spdthari (viii. 25. §§2,3). The temple

below the city was also .sacred to Demeter, whom the

Thelpusians called Erinnys. This temple is alluded

to by Lycophron (1038) and Callimachus (/•>. 107).

It was situated at a place called Onceium, where

Oticus. the son of Apollo, is said once to have reigned

(viii. 25. § 4, seq.; Steph. B. s. v. "OyKuov), Below

this temple stood the temple of Apollo Oncaeates, on

the left bank of the Ladon, and on the right bank that

of the boy Asclepius, with the sepulchre of Trygon,

said to have been the nurse of Asclepius (viii. 25.

J; 11). The ruins of Thelpusa stand upon the slope

of a considerable hill near the village of Vanena

(Bc«'€fa). Tli'?re are only few traces of the walls

of tlie city. At the ruined church of St. John, near

the rivulet, are some Hellenic foundations and frag­

ments of columns. The saint is probably the suc­

cessor of Asclepius, whese temple, as we learn from

Pausanias. stood longest in the city. There are

]ikewi>e the remains of a Roman building, about

12 yards long and 6 wide, with the ruins of an

arched roof. There are aUo near the Ladon some

Hellenic foundations, and the lower parts of six co­

lumns. Below Vanena there stands upon the right

bank of the Ladon the ruined church ot St. A than a-

sius the Miracuh-us, whore Leake found the remains

of several columns. Half a mile below this church

is the village of Tumbiki, where a promontory pro­

jects into the river, upon which there is a mound

apparently artificial. This mound is probably the

tomb of Trygon, and Tumbiki is the bite of the

the temple of Asclepius.
