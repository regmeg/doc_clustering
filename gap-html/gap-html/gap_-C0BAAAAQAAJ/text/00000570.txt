n district, the name of which first occurs in the

ethnographic table of Genesis, x. 29. Solomon

caused a fleet to be built in the Kdomite ports of

the Red Sea, and Hiram supplied him with Phoe­

nician mariners well acquainted with navigation,

and also Tyrian vessels, "ships of Tarehish."

(1 Kings* ix." 23; 2 Chrott. viii. 18.) The articles

of merchandise which were brought back once in

three ye;irs from Ophir were gold, silver, red sandal­

wood ("almuggim," 1 Kings, x. 11; " alguinnum,''

2 Citron, ix. 10), precious stones, ivory, a|<*s,

(4t kopiiim "). and pencocks (" thukvim," 1 Kings, x.

22; " thukyim," 1 Chroti. ix. 21). The gold of Ophir

was considered to be of the most precious quality.

(Jobt xx. 11, 24, xxviii. Iti; Ps. xlv. 9; Isa. xiii.

12; Eccbg, Til. 18). In Jer. x. 9, " the gold

from Uphaz," and in Dan. x. 5, " tlie tine gold of

Upbaz," is, by a slight change of pronunciation, the

nine as that of Ophir.

Many elaborate treatises have been written upon

the details of these voyages. The researches

of Gceenius (Thesaur. Linguae llebr. vol. L p.

141: and in Erseh find V rubers Eneycl. art.

Ophir), Ilenfey (Indien, pp. 30—32) and Lassen

(lud. Alt vol. i. pp. 537—539) have made it ex­

tremely probable that the \V. shores of tlie Indian

peninsula were visited by the Phoenicians, who, by

their colonies in the Persian Gulf, and by their in­

tercourse with the Gerrhaei, were early acquainted

with the periodically blowing monsoons. In favour

of this Indian hypothesis is the remarkable circum­

stance that the names by w hich the article! of mer­

chandise are designated are not Hebrew but Sanscrit.

Tlie peacock, \mt, is an exclusively Indian bird; al­

though from their gradual extension to the YY. they

were often called by the Greeks "Median and Per­

sian birds*" tlie Samians even supposed them to

have originally belonged to Sam OS, as the bird was

reared at first in the sanctuary dedicated to lleia

in that inland. Silks,also, which are first mentioned

in Proverbs, xxxi. 22, could alone have been brought

from India. Qnatreinere (Mem, de VA cad. des

/user. vol. xv. pt. ii. 1845, pp. ,149 — 402) agrees

with Ileeren ( f?<searches, vol. ii. pp. 73, 74, trans.),

who places Ophir on the K. coast of Africa, and ex­

plains " thukyim " to mean not peacocks, but par­

rots or guinea-fowls. Ptolemy (vi. 7. § 41) speaks

of a Saphara (2aV$apa) as a metropolis of

Arabia, and again of a Soi'PARA (So^irapo, \ii. I.

§ t>) in India, on the Barygazenus Sinus, or Gulf

of Canbat/, a name which in Sanscrit signifies

"fair-shore." (Lassen, Jfissert.de Taprolntne Jus.

p. 18; comp. Ituf. Alt. vol. i. p. f>37.) SqfiUa, on

tlie E. Coast of Africa, opposite to the island of

Madagascar (London tleog. Journ. vol. iii. p. 207),

is described by Edrisi (cd. Jaubert, vol. i. p. G7) as

a country rich in gold, and subsequently by the Por-

tuguese, after Gama's voyage of discovery. Tlie let­

ters r and / so frequently interchanged make the
