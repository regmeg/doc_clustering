10-26 SPABTA. SPARTA.

great magnificence, and the spoils of the Persian

wars were employed in tlie erection of a beautiful

stoa in the Agora, with figures of" Persians in white

marble upon the columns, among which Pausanias

admired the statues of Mardonius and Artemisia

(hi. 11. § 3). After the Persian wars Athens be­

came more and more the centre of Greek art; but

Sparta continued to possess, even in the time of

Pausnnias, a larger number of monuments than most

-'titer Grecian cities.

Sparta continued unfortified during the whole

period of autonomous Grecian history; and it was

first surrounded with walls in the Macedonian pe-

lind. We learn from Polybius(ix. 21) that its walls

were 48 stadia in circumference, and that it was

much larger than Megalopolis, which was 50 stadia

in circuit Its superiority to Megalopolis in size

must have been owing to its form, which was cir­

cular. (Polyb. v. '22.) Leake remarks that, " as the

side towards the Kurotas measured about two miles

with the windings of the outline, the computation of

Polybius sufficiently agrees with actual appearances,

though the form of tne city seems rather to have

been semicircular than circular." (Morca, vol. i.

p. 180.) Its limits to the eastward, at the time of

the invasion of Philip (b. c. 218), are defined by

Polvbius, who j-ays (v. 22) that there was a distance

of a stadium and a half between the foot of the cliffs

of Ml. Menelaium and the nearest part of the city.

h\\y al-o describes the Euro!as as flowing close to

tin* walls (xxxiv. 28, xxxv. 29). When Demetrius

Poliorcetes made an attempt upon Sparta in B. 0.

296, some temporary fortifications were thrown up;

and the same was done when Pyrrhus attacked the

city in B.C. 272. (Pans. i. 13. § 6, vii. 8. § 5.)

lint Sparta was first regularly fortified by a wall

and ditch by the tyrant Nabis in b. c 195 (Liv.

xxxiv. 27; Pans. vii. 8. § 5); though even this

wall did not surround the whole city, but only the

level parts, which were more exposed to an eii'-my's

attack. (Liv. xxxiv. 38.) Livy, in his account of

theattatkof Sparta by Philopoemen in B.C. 192,

alludes to two of the gates, one leading to Pharae,

and the other to Mount Barbosthencs. (Liv. xxxv.

30.) After the capture of the city by Philopoemen,

tli.' walls were destroyed by the Achaean League

(Taos. vii. 8. § 5); but they were shortly after­

wards restored by order of the Unmans, when the

latter took the Spartans under their protection in

oppofition to the Achaeans. (Paus. vii. 9. § 5.)

Its walls and nates were still standing when Pau-

;ani is visited Sparta in the second century of the

Christian era, but not a trace of them now remains.

When Alaric took Sparta in A, i>. 396, it was no

longer fortified, nor protected by arms or men

(Zosiin. v. 6); but it continued to be inhabited in the

thirteenth century, as we learn from the " Chronicle

of the Morea." It was then always called Lace-

daemon, and was confined to the heights around the

theatre. The walls which surrounded it at that

time may still be traced, and have been mentioned

above. It is to the medieval Lacedaeraon that the

ruins of the churches belong, of which no less than

[-ix are noticed by the French Commission. Atter

the conquest of Peloponnesus by the Franks in the

thirteenth century, William de Villehardouin built a

strong fortress upon the hill of Mixithra usually

pronounced Mistrd, a little more than two miles

west of Sparta, at the foot of Mt. Taygetus. The

inhabitants of the medieval Lacedaemon soon aban­

doned their town and took re fug* within the fortress

of Mistrd, which long confirmed to be tie eiae yjtt

in the valley of the Eurotas. The stte of ?-j»r»
