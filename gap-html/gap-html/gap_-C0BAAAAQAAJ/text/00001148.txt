1062 STRACUSAE. SYRACUSAE.

Marcellus, and were evidently still extant in the

days of the orator, who enumerates most of them by

name. All the four quarters of the city, the Island,

Achradina, Tycha, and Neapolis, were still well in­

habited; though as a measure of precaution no per­

sons of native Syracusan extraction were permitted to

dwell in the Island. (/&. v. 32.) But the pros­

perity of Syracuse seems to have sustained a severe

shock in the time of Scxtus Pompeius, who, accord­

ing to Strabo, inflicted upon it injuries, from which

it appears never to have recovered. Such was its

decayed condition that Augustus endeavoured to

recruit it by sending thither a Roman colony (n. c.

21). But the new settlers were confined to the

Island and to the part of the city immediately

adjoining it, forming a portion only of Achradina

and Neapolis. (Strab. vi. p. 270; Dion Cass. liv. 7;

1'lin. iii. 8. s. 14.) It is in this part of the town

that the amphitheatre and other edifices of Roman

construction arc still found.

liut though greatly fallen from its former splen­

dour, Syracuse continued throughout the Roman

Empire to be one of the most considerable cities of

Sicily, and still finds a place in the 4th century in

the Ordo Nobilium Urbiuin of Ausonius. The na­

tural strength of the Island as a fortress rendered it

always a post of the utmost importance. After the fall

of the Western Empire, it fell with the rest of Sicily

under the dominion of the Goths, hut was recovered

by Belisarius in A. i>. 535, and annexed to the do-

ininions of the Byzantine emperors, in whose hands

it continued till the 9th century, when it was finally

wreMed from them by the Arabs or Saracens. Sy­

racuse was, with the single exception of Taurome-

niuin, the last place in Sicily that fell into the hands

of those invaders: it was still a very strong fortress,

and it was not till 878, more than fifty years after

the Saracens first landed in the island, that it was

compelled to surrender, after a siege of nine months'

duration. The inhabitants were put to the sword,

the fortifications destroyed, and the city given up to

the flames. Nor did it ever recover from this ca­

lamity, though the Island seems to have always

continued to be inhabited. Its fortifications were

(strengthened by Charles V., and assumed very much

their present appearance. The modern city, which

is still confined to the narrow limits of the Island,

contains about 14.000 inhabitants. But the whole

of the expanse on the opposite side of the strait, as

weil as the broad table-land of Achradina and Epi-

polae, are now wholly bare and desolate, being in

great part uncultivated as well as uninhabited.

III. Topoorapiiv.

The topographical description of Syracuse as it

existed in the days of its greatness cannot better be

introduced than in the words of Cicero, who has

described it in unusual detail. "You have often

heard (says he) that Syracuse was the largest of

all Greek cities, and the most beautiful of all cities.

And it is so indeed. For it is both strong by its

natural situation and striking to behold, from what­

ever side it is approached, whether by laud or sea.

It has two ports, as it were, enclosed within the

buildings of the city itself, so as to combine with it

from every point of view, which have different and

separate entrances, but are united and conjoined

together at the opposite extremity. The junction

of these, separates from the mainland the part of

the town which is called the Inland, but this is re­

united to the continent by a bridge across the nar­

row strait which divides them. fsi jr^at i- tbt

of Syracuse, which were commonly comirirtM ':'

separate cities; and it appears thit IHo>i=jnt 3*

the same account. (Diod. xxvi. ly.ed.1v--'
