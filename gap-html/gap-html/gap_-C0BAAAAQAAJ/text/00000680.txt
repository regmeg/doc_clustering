♦eviinj, Polyb.), a tt»wii in the XK. of Arcadia, whose

territory was bounded on the N. by that of the Achaean

towns of Aegeira ami Pallene, E. by the Stym-

phalia, W. by the Cleitoria, and S. by the Caphyatis

and Orehomeuia. This territory is shut in on every

side by lofty mountains, offshoots of Mt. Cyllene and

the Arounian chain; and it is about 7 miles in

length and the same in breadth. Two streams de­

scend from the northern mountains, and unite their

waters about the middle of the valley; the united

river is now culled Foiiitttiko, and bore in ancient

times the name of Olbius and Amaliius. (Paus. viii.

14. ^ 3.) There is no opening through the moun­

tains oti the S.: but the waters of the united river are

carried off by katarothra, or subterranean channels

in the limestone rocks, and, after (Whig under­

ground, reappear as the sources of the river La don.

In order to convey the waters of this river in a

single channel to the hntavothra, the inhabitants at

an early period constructed a canal, 50 stadia in

length, and 30 feet in breadth. (Pans. /. c; comp.

Catull. Ixviii. 109.) Tins groat work, which was

attributed to Hercules, had heroine useless in the

time of Pausanhis, and the river had resumed its

ancient and irregular course; but traces of the canal

of Hercules are still visible, and one hank of it was

a conspicuous object in the valley when it was visited

by Leake in the year 1.806. The canal of Hercules,

however, could not protect the valley from the dan­

ger to which it was exposed, in consequence of the

hitavothra becoming obstructed, and the river finding

no outlet for its waters. The Pheneatae related

that their city was nine destroyed by such an inun­

dation, and in proof of it they pointed out upon the

mountains the marks of the height to which the

water was said to have ascended. (Pans. viii. 14.

§ 1.) Pausanias evidently refers to tin: yellow

border which is still visible upon the mountains and

around the plain; but in consequence of the great

height of this line upon the rocks, it is difficult to

believe it t<> be the mark of the ancient depth of

water in the ['lain, and it is more probably caused

by evaporation, as Leake has suggested; the lower

parts of the rock being constantly moistened, while

the upper are in a state of comparative dryness, thus

producing a difference of colour in process of time.

It is, however, certain that the Pheneatic plain has

been exposed more than once to such inundations.

Pliny says that the calamity had occurred five times

(xxxi. 5. s. 30); and Eratosthenes related a me­

morable instance of such an inundation through the

obstruction of the kutavolhra, when, after they were

again opened, the water rushing into the Lad on and

the Alpheius overflowed the banks of those rivers

at < Hyinpia. (Strah. viii. p. 389.)

The account of Eratosthenes has been confirmed

by a similar occurrence in modern times. In 1821

the htfavothra became obstructed, and the water

continued to rise in the plain till it had destroyed

7 or 8 square miles of cultivated country. Such

was its condition till 1832, when the s*ubterraneous

channels again opened, the Ladon and Alpheius

overt!owed, and the plain of Olympia was inundated.

Other ancient writers allude to the hUavuthra and

subterraneous course of the river of Phencus.

(Theophr. HUl. Plant, iii. 1; Diod. xv. 49.)

in the description of Pausanias compared 'J*

precipitous on every side, and thai only a sr:jJ> f*

of it was artificially fortified: but the somran. ri a

insulated hill, upon which the remains of iV-ss

are found, is too small apparently for the arropJ

of such an important city, and moreover it uu

regular slo|>e, though a very nigced surtax.

Leake supposes that the whole of this hill

the aero|x-lis of Phencus. and that the kwrr w

w.as in a part of the subjacent plain: but tlx ^.3

hill is not of that precipitous kind which ti* i

scriptioii of Pausanias would lead one to

and it is not impossible that the aeropolia djj sa

been on some other height in the nei^Lbourt»"»J.a

that the hill * n which the ancient remaua art W

may have been part of the lower city.

There were several roads from Phenyl* to'

surrounding town*. Of these the northern ttb4

Aehaia ran through the Pheneatic plain. I pal

a temple of Apollo Pythius, which was in rta«

the time of Pausanias. A little above the vm

the road divided, the one to the left leadirr m
