VIOLVASCENSIS PAGUS. [Martiaus.]

VIPITENUM, a town in Bhaetia belonging to

the Venostes. situated between Veldidena and Tri-

ner. [T. H. D.]

VIPOSCIAXA,a place in Mauretania Tingitana,

on the road from Tocolo^da to Tingis. (/tin. Ant.

it is the place culled PrUciana by Mela (iii. 10.

sub fin.), and TlriuKiava or UiffKidva by Ptolemy

(iv. 1. § 14). The same author identifies it with

Meryo, whilst La pie takes it to be Soe-el-Arba, and

Grabenj di Hemso, Dar-el-Hhamara. [T. H. P.]

VIRACELLUM (BipavtAAoy, Ptol.), a town of

Etruria, mentioned only by Ptolemy (iii. 1. § 47),

corner of that country. It is supposed by Cluverius

to be represented by Verrucolaat Verrucchia in the

mountains between the Serchio and the Magra

(Cluver. Ital. p. 75), but the identification is very

doubtful. [E. H. B.]

ritory of the Licatii in Vindelicia, a tributary of the

Licus, which it joins a little below Augusta Vin-

N. boundary of Britannia Romana and in the terri­

tory of the lirigantes, the station of the Cohors vi.

Cumberland; whilst others seek it on the S. coast

of Sohcaij Frith, and at Preston. [T. H. D.]

VllMA'KSCA (OihpoiWa, Ptol. ii. 6. §53), a

town of the Autrigones in Hispania Tarraconensis,

on the road from Pompelo to A.sturiea {Itin. Ant

xxvii. p. 13.) Coins in Sestini (p. 211). [T.H.D.]

VIROVIACUM, in Gallia,in theTable.Virovinum,

is placed ona routefromCH>teIlunt(C(«5(^) to Turna-

cum (Tourna>/). The Antonine Itinerary fixes it xvi.

from each place. The distances in the Table do not

acrrce; but the site is certain. It is Wertcic or

Verwick, n large village on the Lys, 3 leagues from

Lille in the French department of Nord. In 1514

a medal of C. Julius Caesar was dug up at FFemrie,

and some time afterwards other medals t£ lb* *V?
