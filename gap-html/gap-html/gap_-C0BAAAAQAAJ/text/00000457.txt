nations inhabiting the Alps. The inscription of

this monument lias been preserved to us by I'liny

(iii. 20. s. 24), and is one of our chief authorities

for the geography of the Alpine tribes. The ruins

of the monument itself, which wns of a very massive

character, still remain, and rise like a great tower

above the village of Turtria, the name of which is

evidently a mere corruption of Trofaf.a Augusti

(Tooraia ifgeurrov, Ptol. iii. 1. § 2), or Tropaka

Alpium, as it is termed by Pliny (/. a).

The line of the Roman road, cut in the face of tho

mountain, may be traced for some distance on each

side of Tvrbia, and several ancient milestones have

been found, which commemorate the construction of

the road by Augustus, and its reparatiou by Hadrian.

(Millin. Voy. en Piemmt, vol. ii. pp. 135, 138;

Durante, Chorographie du Comti de Nice, pp. 23

—30.)

The port of Monoecus seems to have been the

extreme limit towards the E. of the settlements of

Massilia, and hence both I'liny and Ptolemy regard it

as the point from whence the Ligurian coast, in the

more strict sense of the term, began. (Plin. iii. 5.

a. 7; Ptol. iii. 1. §§2, 3.) Ptolemy has made a

strange mistake in separating the Portus Herculis

and Portus Monoeci, as if they were two distinct

places. [E.H. B.J

MONS AUREUS (Xpoo-our 6>or) 1. A moun­

tain in Moesia Superior, which the emperor Probus

planted with vines. (Eutrop. ix. 17, 20; It. Ant.

p. 132; It II. p. 564.)

2. A town on the Danube, at the foot of the

mountain, 23 miles from Singidunum. (Tab.

Pent.) [A. L.]

MONS BALBUS, a mountain fastness of N.

Africa, to which Musinissa retired. (Liv. xxix. 31.)

Shaw (l'rav. p. 184) places the range in the dis­

trict of Vakhul, E. of Tunis; perhaps Sabalet-es-

Sahil,. [E. B. J.]

MONS BRISIACUS. This is one of the posi­

tions in the Roman ltins. along the Rhine. They

place it between Helvctutn or Hclcebus [Hkix"K1)i;sJ

and Urunci. There is no doubt that is Vieux-

Brisach or Altbreisach, as the Germans call it All

the positions of the ltins. on the Rhine are on the

west or Gallic side of the river, but Yieux-Brisach

is on the east side. The Rhine has changed its

bed in several parts, and this is one of the places

where there has been a change. Breisach is de­

scribed by Luitprand of Pavia (quoted by D'Anville),

as being in the tenth century surrounded by the

Rhine " in modum insulae." It may have been on

an island in the Roman period. The hill (mons) of

Altbreisuch is a well marked position, and was once

crowned by a citadel. Altlyreisnch is now in the

ducby of Baden, and opposite to Xeubreuack on the

French side of the Rhine. [G. L.]

MONS MARIO'RUM, a town in Hispania Bae-

tica, on the Mons Marianus, and on the road leading

from the mouth of the Anas to Emerita, now Ma­

rine*, in the Sierra Moreno. (It. Ant. p. 442;

Inscr. ap. Caro, Ant. i. 20; Spon. Miscell. p. 131;

Klorez, Ksp. Sagr. ix. p. 23.)

MONS SACER (to Uphv Spot, Ptol. iii. 17. § 4),

a mountain range on the SE. coast of Crete, near'

Hierapytna, identified with the Pytna (nirrya) of

Strabo (x. p. 472; comp. Groskunl, ad loc.; Hock,

jrreto,vol. i. p. 16.) [E. B.J.]

MONS SELEUCUS, in Gallia Narbonensis, is

placed in the Antonine Itin. next to Vapincum

(Cap), on a road from Vapincum to Vienna (I ienne).
