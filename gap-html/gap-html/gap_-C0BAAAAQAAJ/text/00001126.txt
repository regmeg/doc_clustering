137, '231). It is called Caatoxobra or Castra Larba

in the /tin. Bieroa. (p. .568), and KacrTpd£ap€ai by

Procopius (tie Aed. iv. 11. p, 305, ed. Bonn), and

r«'tani;i Cuesariensis. lying to the SK. of the mouth

jip|>ears in Ammianus Marcellinus under the name

of Oppidom Sugabarritnnum (xxix. 5). Mannert

SUCCOTH (I.XX. 2t>K\u>ed. Vat.. 2wX«. Alex.),

a city of the tribe of (lad in the valley, formerly

part of the kingdom of Sibon king of Hesbbon

(Jitsh. xiii. 27). It is connected with Zarthan in

1 Kiwjs, vii. 4G, where Hiram is said to have cast

his bnwen vessels, &c. for Solomon's temple " in

the plain of Jordan, in the clay ground between

Succoth an 1 Zarthan," elsewhere called Zaretan,

mentioned in the account of the miraculous passage

of the Israelites (Josh. iii. 16). The city doubt­

less derived its name from the incident in the life of

Jacob mentioned in Genesis (xxxiii. 17) where the

name is translated by the I.XX. as in the parallel

jiassuL'ein Jo.-ephu>(.4 nt. i.21.§ 1), Hicnvai (booths).

It was therefore south of the Jabbok. and the la-it

station of Jacob before lie crossed the Jordan to-

ward> Sluvlicm. S. Jerome, in his commentary on

the passage, says, *' Snchoth: est usque hodic civi-

t;is irar.s Jordanem hoc vocabulo in parte Scytho-

j-oleos,"' from which some writers have inferred that

Scjthopolu may have derived its name from this

place in its vicinity (Robinson, Bibl. /Us. vol. iii.

p. 175. n. 5), and this hypothesis is supported by

the re>j**etable names of Relund, Ge-enius, aud

KuHeninUller. A place called Succat is still pointed

out by the Arabs south of Beisan ( = Rethslian =

Scythopolis), on the east side of Jordan, rear the

month of Wudy Mm. [G. \V.]
