107; Diod. xii. 08), Stryme (Ileml. vu. 118:

Smd. v. ^.TpvuT}), DAtum, and .it a later periled

Crenidcs. (Bockh, J'ubl. Econ. of Athens, p. 312,

Kngl. tr.) Herodotus, who visited Thasos, says

that the most remarkable mines were those worked

by the Phoenicians on the eastern side of the island

between Aenyra and Coenyra opposite Samotlirace,

where a large mountain had been overturned in

search of the gold. (Herod, vi. 47.) The Thasians

appear to have been the only Greeks who worked

the valuable mines in Thrace, tilt Histiaens, the

Milesian, settled npon tlie Strymon and built the

town of Myremus, about n. c. 511. (Herod, v. 11,

23.) Alter the capture of Miletus (it. c. 494). His-

tiaeus made an unsuccessful attempt to subdue

Thasos (Herod, vi. 28), but the growing power of

the Thasians excited the suspicions of Dareins,

who commanded them in B.C. 492 to pull down

their fortifications and remove their ships of war to

Abdera,—an order which they did not venture to

disobey. (Herod, vi. 4b\) When Xerxes marched

throiiL'h Thrace on his way to Greece, the Thasians,

on account of their possessions on tlie mainland,

had to provide for the lVr>i:m army as it marched

through their territories, the ca>t of which amounted

to 400 talents (92.600/.). (Herod, vii. 118.) After

the defeat of the Persians, Thasos became a member

of the confederacy of Delos; but disputes having

:iiisen between the Thasians and Athenians re­

specting the mines upon the mainland, a war

envied, ami the Athenians sent a powerful force

against the island under the command of Cimon,

n. c. 4G">. After defeating the Thasians at sea,

the Athenians disembarked, and laid .siege to the

city both by land and sea. The Thasians held out

ttMiv than tw<» years, and only surrendered in the

third year. They were compelled to raze their for­

tifications; to surrender their ships of war; to give

up their continental possessions; and to pay an im­

mediate contribution in money, in addition to their

annual tribute. (Time. i. 100, 101 j Diod. xi. 70;

Pint. Cim. 14.) In B.C. 411 the democracy in

Tliasos was overthrown, and an oligarchical go­

vern ment established by 1'eisander and the Four

Hundred at Athens; but as soon as the oligarchy

had got possession of the power they revolted from

Athens, and received a Lacedaemonian garrison and

harmost. (Thuc. viii. 04.) Much internal dis­

sension followed, till at length in B.C. 408 a party

of the citizens, headed by Ecphantus, expelled the

Lacedaemonian harmost Eteonicus with his gar­

rison and admitted Thrasybulus, the Athenian com­

mander. (Xen. Hell. i. i. 12, 32, i. 4. § 9;

llein. c.Lept p. 474.) After the battle of Aegos-

potamos, Thasos passed into the hands of the Lace-

daemonians; but it was subsequently again de­

pendent upon Athens, as we see from the disputes

between Philip and the Athenians. (Dem. tie Union.

p. 80; Philipp. Epiat. p. 159.) In the Roman wars in

Greece Thasos submitted to Philip V. (Polvb. xv.

24), but it received its freedom from the Komans

after the battle of Cynoscenhalae, B.C. 197 (Polyb.

xviii, 27, 31; Liv. xxxiii. 30, 3.r»), and continued

to be a tree {libera) town in the time of Pliny

(iv. 12. s. 23).

The city of Tliasos was situated in the northern

part of the island, and possessed two ports, of which

one was closed. (Seylax, p. 27; Pto!. iii. II. § 14.)

It strxnl on three eminences; and several remains

of the ancient walls exis-t, intermixed with towers

built by the Venetians, who obtained possession of

the island after the capture of CoeEartione* W
