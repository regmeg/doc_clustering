much to their effect. Dante speaks of tlie environs

of Pola, as in his lime remarkable for the numerous

sarcophagi ami ancient tombs with which they wen1

almost wholly occupied. These have, now disap­

peared. (Dante, Jnf ix. 13.)

The antiquities of Pola have been repeatedly de­

scribed, ami illustrated with figures; among others,

in the fourth volume of Stuart and Revett's Athens,

fol. Loud. 1816, and in the Voyage Pittoresque de

Vhlrie et de la Dalmatie, fol. Paris, 1802; also in

Alton's Antiquities of Pola. fol., Lond. 1819.

The harbour of Pola is completely landlocked, so

as to have the appearance of a small basin-shaped

kike, communicating by a narrow channel with the

sea. Off its entrance lies a group of small islands

called the TsoU Brhni, which are probably those

called by Pliny Cissa and Pull aria. (Plin. iii. 26.

s. 30.) The southernmost promontory of Istria,

about 10 miles distant from Pola, derived from it the

name of Polaticum Proraontorium, It is now called

Capo Promantore. [E. H. li.]

POLEMO'NJUM (IlaXfjunior), a town on the

coast of Pontus, at the mouth of the small river Si-

denus, 10 stadia from Phadisane, and 130 from Cape

Iasonium. (Arrian, Peripl. p. IG ; Anonym. Peripl.

p. 11, &c; Ptol. v. 6. § 4; Steph. B. s. r.) Pliny

(vi. 4) places tile town 120 Roman miles from Ami-

sus, which seems to be too great a distance. (Comp.

Aniiii. Mare. xxii. S; Microti, p. 702. where it is er­

roneously called ToKffi6vtov; Tab. Penting.} Neither

Strabo nor any writer before him mentions this town,

and it is therefore generally believed that it was built

on the site of the town of Side, which is not noticed by

any writer after Strabo. Its name intimates that it

was founded, or at all events was named, after one

Polemon, perhaps the one who was made kins of that

part of Pontus, about n. c. 36, by M. Antonius. It j

had a harbour, and seems to have in the course ,

of time become a place of considerable import­

ance, as the part of Pontus in which it was situated

received from it the name of Pontus Polemoniants.

The town was situated on the western bank of the

Sidenus, where its existence is still attested by the

ruins of an octagon church, and the remains of a

massive wall; but the ancient name of the place is )

preserved by the village of Potdemnn, on the opposite

side of the river. (Hamilton, Jiesearckes, vol. i.

p. 270.) [L.S.]

I'OLICHNA (UnKlxva). 1. A town of Laconia,

mentioned only by Poly bills (iv, 36), is placed by

Leake in the interior of the country on the eastern

slope of Mt. Pamon at Rtvnda (ra Peorra), where,

among the ruins of a fortified town of the lower

empire, are some remains of Hellenic walls. (Leake,

PelfrponnesMca, p. 364.)

2. A town in the NW. of Messenia on the road

from Andania to Dorium and Cypari&sia, (Paus,

iv. 33. § 6.) [Doricm.]

3. A town of Megaris, mentioned only in a line

of Homer, quoted by Strabo, for which the Athenians

substituted another to prove that Salamis at the

time of the Trojan War was a dependency of

Athens. (Strab. ix. p. 394.)

4. (F.th. n«\ix''i'Tjjs), a town of Crete, whose |

territory bordered upon that of Cydonia. (Time.'

it. 85.) In b. C. 429 the Athenians assisted the

inhabitants of Polielma in making war upon the

Cydonians. (Thuc. I c.) Herodotus also mentions

the Policbnitae, and says that this people and the

Praesii were the only people in Crete who did not

join the other Cretans in the expedition against 1

Camicus in Sicily in order to revenge th* »V»tSi

Minos (vii. 170; Steph. li. s. r.). Cramer (A mm

Greece, vol. iii. p. 3SO) supposes the rains at P61m >.

of Armyro to be those of Policbna, which PuiiW,

however, regards as those of Lappa or Lam;*.

not far from the right bank of the Tiber, and it-^i

12 miles E. of Viterbo. The name is n« fixr* a

any writer earlier than Paulas Diaconas (Hist I*;

iv. 8), and there is therefore no evidence of iii

tiquity: but it is certain that there existed o »

cient Etruscan city about 2 miles N. of the pp-^i

village of Bomarzo. Some rums and other s^*.

vestiges of ancient buildings still remain, au>i KB*

rous sepulchres have been discovered, someot'tjei

POL ISM A (noAitr^a), a small place gq
