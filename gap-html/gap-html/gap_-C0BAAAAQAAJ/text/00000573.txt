of Orchoe and of

the district surrounding it. We now know that this

country was ruled in very early times by a Chaldacan

race, some of the kings of which Berosus has re­

corded. (Rawlinson, tn Athenaeum, 1854, No. 1377;

Euseb. Praepar. Ecang. ix. 17.) It is worthy of

notice that Eusebius has preserved an ancient

fragment from Eupolemus, who speaks of a city of

Babylonia,Camarina,'' which some call Urie(Oip'w)."

As the Assyrian name of Warka is written with a

monogram which signifies " the Moon," and as the

name Camarina would naturally be derivable from

the Arabic Kamar, " the Moon," there is an ad­

ditional connection between the two names. (Euseb.

L c.) It is also clear from the inscriptions that the

names of the two cities were constantly inter­

changed. [V.]

OKCHO'MENUS. 1. ('Opxo/ia>di; in insc. and

coins, 'HpxofuyJs: Eth. 'Opxontvtos, 'Epxo/icVtos),

usually called the Minykan Orchohknus ('Opxo-

u*vbs VLaittoi, Horn. IL ii. 511; Time. iv. 76; Strab.

ix. p. 414), a city in the north of Boeotia, and in

ante-historical times the capital of the powerful

kingdom of the Minyae. This people, according to

tradition, seem to have come originally from Thessaly.

We read of a town Minya in Thessaly (Steph. B.

». p. Mirua), and also of a Thessalian Orchomenus

Minyeus. (Plio. iv. 8. s. 15.) The first king of the

Boeotian Orchomenus is said to have been Andreus,

a son of the Thessalian river Peneius, from whom

the country was called Andreis. (Paus. ix. 34. § 6;

ol 'Opxouivtoi aToiicol flat 0e<r<raAwir, Schol. ad

ApoU. Rhod. ii. 1190.) Andreus assigned part of his

territory to the Aetolian Athamas, who adopted two

of the grandchildren of his brother Sisyphus: they

gave their names to Haliartus and Coroneia. Andreus

was succeeded in the other part of his territory by

his son Eteocles, who was the first to worship the

Charites (Graces) in Greece. Upon the death of

Eteocles the sovereignty devolved upon the family of

Halmus or Almus, a son of Sisyphus. (Paus. ix.

34.§7—ix.85.) Halmus had two daughters,Chryse

and Chrysogeneia. Chryse by the god Ares became

the mother of Phlegyas, who succeeded the childless

Eteocles, and called the country Phlegyantis after

himself. He also gave his name to the fierce and

sacrilegious race of the Plilegyac, who separated

themselves from the other Orchomenians. and at­

tempted to plunder the temple of Delphi. They were

however all destroyed by the god. with the exception

of a few who fied into Phocis. Phlegyas died with­

out children, and was succeeded by Ulnyses, the son

of Chrysojreneia by the god Poseidon. Chryses was

the father of the wealthy Minyas, who built the

treasury, and who gave his name to the Minyan race.

Minyas was succeeded by his son Orchomenus, after

whom the city was named. (Paus. ix. 36. §§ 1—6.)

Some modern scholars have supposed that the Minyae

were Aeolians (Thirlwall, Hist, of Greece, vol. i. p.

91); but as they disappeared before the historical

period, it is impossible to predicate anything certain

respecting them. There is, however, a concurrence

of tradition to the fact, that Orchomenus was in the

earliest times not only the chief city of Boeotia, but

one of the most powerful and wealthy cities of

Greece. It has been observed that the genealogy of

Orchomenus glitters with names which express the

traditional opinion of bis unbounded wealth (Chryses,

Chrysogeneia). Homer even compares the treasures

which flowed into the city to those of the Egyptian

Thebes (//. ix. 381; comp. Eustath. /. c.) It would

seem that at an early period Orchomenus ruled ov
