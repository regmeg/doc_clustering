TAPSUS FLUVIUS. [Tiiapsl.*.]

TAPU'RA (Tu'irowfja), a town of uncertain site in

Armenia Minor, is mentioned only by Ptolemy (v.

7. $ 3). [L. S.]

TAPURE1 (Tanox'peoi, PtoL vi. 14. §§ 12. 13),

a tribe in Scythia intra Imaum. [T. H. !>.]

TAPU'RI (Tdirovpot or Tdirvpoi, Strab. XL p.

520; PUn. vi. 16. s. 18), a tribe whose name

ami probable habitations appear, at different

periods of history, to have been extended along

a wide space of country from Armenia to the east­

ern side of the Oxns. Strabo places them along­

side the Caspian Gates and Rhagae, in Parthia,

(xi. p. 514), or between the Der bices and Ujrcaoi

(xi. p. 520), or in company with the Amardi and

oilier ]>eople al>ng the Hitithern shores of the Cas­

pian (xi. p. 523); in which Uvst view Curtius (vi. 4.

§ 24. viii. I. § 13), Diunysius (tie Situ Orbis. 733).

and Pliny (vi. 16. s. 18) may be considered to co-

iiu ide. Ptolemy in one place reckons them among

the tribes of Media (vi.2.$)6), and in another ascribes

them to Blargiana (vi. 10. § 2). Their name is

written with some differences in different authors;

thus Tdwovpoi and Tawpoi occur in Strabo; Ta-

puri in Pliny and Curtius; Tdrvppoi in Staph* B.

There can be no doubt that the present district of

Taberistdn derives its name from them. Aelian

(1*. //. iii. 13) gins a peculiar description of the

Tajiiiri who dwelt iu Media. (Wilson, Arinna, p.

157.) [V.]

I'APU'RI MONTES, a chain of mountains, in

Scythia, to the N. of the Jaxartes, apparently a

portion of tlie Altai ranee, towards its western ex­

tremity (Ptol vi. 14. § 7). It may, however, be

doubted whether this view of Ptolemy is really

correct. It would seem more likely that they are con­

nected with the Tapuri, a tribe who nearly adjoined

the Uyrcani [Tapvh]; and this a notice in Poly hi us

would awx'ar clearly to imulv (v. 44\ [V.]

TARACHI (Tapaxoi, 1'tol. vii. 4. § 8)."a tribe

of Taprobane or Ctyhm, who occupied the SK. corner

of the M.ind bel'jw the Mulea mountains (Aflams

Peak). They appear to bare had a port called 'HAiov

\iuT)y, probably in the neighbourhood of the present

Vmtam, Near to them was a river called the

Barace (Ptol. vii. 4. § 5). It is not unlikely that

the river and the people had once the same name,

which hat since been modified by the change of the

initial letters. [V.]

TARANDRUS (TdpavBpot; Eth. Tapdv&pios), a

place in Phrjgia of unknown site, is meutioned only

by Stephanas Byz. ( s. v.). [L. S.]

TAKAXEI, a people in Arabia Deserta of un­

known site. (Plin. vi. 28. s. 32.)

TAKAS. [Taickntlm.]

TARASCON (TapaaKuv: Tarascon).a tows ia

tlie Provincia Xarbonensis, on the east side of the

Iikone, between Aries and Avignon The railway

from A vifjnon to Marseille passes through Tarascon,

and there is a branch from Taraxcxm to Mimes.

Ptolemy (m whose text the name is written Tapow-

rrKwy) enumerates Tanaoon among the towns of the

Salyee [Sai.yks]. Strabo (iv. p. 178) says that the

Nad from Xemausus (Xirues') to Aquae Scxliac >

p;isses through Utremum (licavcairc) and Tarascon,

and that the distance from Xemausus to Aqnae

Bextiac is 53 Roman miles; which, as D'Anville ob- |

serves, is not correct. In another passage (iv. p. 187)

Strabo makes the distance from Ximes to the bank

of the Rhone opposite to Tarascon about 100 stadia,

which is exact enough. [TAKiscostiiXSES ] [G.L.]

Ausonius (Parent, iv. 11) gives the mgx
