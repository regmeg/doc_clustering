1(1-1 KIRJATIL KEDESH.

Ki:DESH(Ka5iir,I.XX.). 1. A townofX'aphtali,

20 SI. P. from Tyre. (Euscb. OnomaiU i. v. Cedn.)

Its CanaanitUh chieftain was slain at the conquest

of the land (Josh. xii. 22); afterwards it belonged

to the Levitcs, and waa one of the cities of refuge.

(Josh, xx. 7, xxi. 32 j 1 Chron. vi. 76.) Barak was

born here (Judge), iv. 6): and Tiglath-Pilcscr made

the conquest of it (2 Kings, xv. 29). It was the

scene of the victory of Jonathan Maccabaeus over the

princes of Demetrius (1 Hacc. xi. 63—73), and was

the birthplace of Tobias (KoSii T7Jr N«iJ>0aA«(fi,

Tubit, i. 2). In Josephus, tXHtaa (Antii/. ix. 11.

§ 1) or KcSao-a (Antiq. xiii. 5. § 1) is spoken of as

the boundary between Tyre and Galilee: during the

war it appears to have been hostile to Galilee

(B.J. ii. 18. § 1). The strongly fortified place in

this district, called Ko5okto-o1 by the same writer

(B. J. iv. 2. § 3), is probably the same as Kedesh.

A village on the hills opposite the marshes of llulet-

Bdniis, still called Kola, is identified by Dr.

Robinson with the ancient city. (BihL Rei. vol. iii.

p. 355.) Kedn was visited in 1844 by the ltev.

Eli Smith, who has a full account of it in MS.

(Biblioth. Sacra, vol. iii. p. 203.)

2. A town in the S. district of the tribe of Judah.

(Joih. xv. 23.)

3. A town of Issachar, belonging to the Lcvites.

KKILAU (K«Ao\ LXX.; KiAAo, Joseph. Antiq.

vi. 13. § 1; KnAa, Euseb.), a city in the tribe of

Judah (Josh, xv. 44), 8 M. P. from Elcathcropolis.

(Euscb. Onomast. s. v.) When the city was be­

sieged by the Philistines, David relieved it, but the

thankless inhabitants would have delivered him into

the hands of Saul. (1 Sam. xxiii. 1—13.) It

assisted in the building of the walls of Jerusalem

(.VeA. iii. 17,18); and, according to tradition, the

prophet Habakkuk was buried here. (Sozomen,

II. E. vii. 29; Niceph. //. E. xii. 48; Reland, Palaui.

]>. 698; Winer, BMisch. liealtcorl. s. r.; Von Rau-

liier. Paint, p. 207.) [E. B. J.]

KKNITES (Kimuoi, LXX.), a semi-nomad tribe

of Midianites, dwelling among the Amalckites. (Gen.

xv. 19; AW. xxiv. 21; 1 Sam. xv. 6.) llobab

(Jcthro), the father-in-law of Moses, and IJebcr, the

husband of Jacl, who slew Siscra (Judg. i. 16, iv.

11), belonged to this rare. The Rcchabitcs are

mentioned, with other families, as belonging to the

Kenites. (1 Chron. ii. 55; Jcr. xxxv. 2; Winer,

». v.; Hitter, Enlhtntle, vol. xv. pp. 135—138;

Kwald, Gtsch. da Voiles Israel vol. i. p. 337,

vol. ii. p. 31.) [E.B.J.]

KENMZZITES (Ktrafcuoi, LXX), a I'anaanitish

tribe. (Gen. xv. 19.) Caleb, the con of Jej liuiincli,

is called a Kenezite {Sum. xxxii. 12; Joth. xiv. 6),

and Othniel, his younger brother, is also called a

Hon of Kenaz. (Judg. i. 13, iii. 9; comp. Joih. xv. 17;

1 Chron. iv. 13.) Another branch of this race are

referred to the E.loinites. (ftrn xxxvi. 11; Winer,

i. r.; Hitter. Erdkunde. vol. xv. p. 138; Ewald,

Gtteh. da Yolktt lira* I. vol. i. p. 338.) [E. B. J.]

KKRIOTH (Kapaie, LXX). 1. A town of the

tribe of Judah. (Joth. xv. 25.) It was probably

the birthplace of the traitor Judas, who owed his

surname ('Iokooiwtiii) to this plan-. ((.'amp, Winer,

1.1. Judas.) Dr. Robinson (Hibl. tin. vol. ii. p. 472 )

-^ 'lias suggested that it may bo represented by El-  
JCirryrltin, situated at the foot of the mountain

ridge S. of Hebron, where there arc site* of roira

visible.

2. A town of Moab. (Jer. xlviii. 24. 41; A mo*.

ii. 2.) [K. B.J.]

KIHJATH, a word signifying in Hebrew "town."

or "city;" the following arc the principal places to

which this term is attached.

1. Kiiuathaim (Kif<ia0ahi, LXX.), or t!»

"double city," one of the most ancient towns in the

country E. of the Jordan, at it was in the hands •{

the Einims (Gen. xiv. 5; comp. Ewald, Geieh. del

VoUxi Israel, vol. i. p. 308), who were expelled

from it by the Moabites. (Dent, it 9, 11.) Kirja-

thaim was afterwards assigned to the children of

Reuben (A'eim. xxxii. 37; Josh. xiii. 19); but

during the exile the Moabites recovered this and

other towns. (Jer. xlviii. 1, 23; Euk. xxt. 9.)

Eusebius nod .Jerome (OnomntL I. r. Kapialaip)

describe it as being full of Christians, and lying

10 M. P. W. of Medeba. Burckhardt (7Vor. p.367)

heard of ruins called EUTeim, half an hour W. rf

the site of Medeba, which he conjectures to have

been this place, the last syllable of the name being

retained. This does not agree with the distance in

the Onomasticon, but Jerome is probably wrong in

identifying the Christian town with the ancient

Kirjathaim, as the former is no doubt, from the data

assigned by him, the modern Kurtgeiat, S- of the

Waidg Znrka Mam, and the latter the El-Ttim of

Burckhardt, to the N. of the Wailg. (Comp. Hitter,

Erdkunde, vol. xv. pp. 1185, 1186.) There was

another place of this name in the tribe of Xaphtali.

(1 Chron. vi. 76.)

2. Kiiuath-Auba, the ancient name of Hebnn,

bnt still in use in the time of Xehemiah (xi. 25).

[Hf.bhon.]

3. Kuuath-Baai. [Kuuath-Jkarim.]

4. KiRJATII-lIuzoTH, or "city of street*," a

town of Moab. (Sum. xxii. 39.)

5. Kiiuath-Jeakim, or "city of forests," one

of the four towns of the Gibeonites (Josh. ix. 17),

and not far distant from Beeruth (El-Birth). (Ezra,

ii. 25.) At a later period the ark was brought here

from Beth-Shemesh (I .Sam.vii. 1,2), and remained

there till it was removed to Jerusalem (1 Citron.

xiii. 6). The place was rebuilt and inhabited aftrr

the exile (Etra,l.c; St h. vii. 29). Josephus (Ami.

vi. 1. § 4) says that it was near to Belb-Sheii>nb,

and Eusebius and Jerome (Onomnit. i.r. Bmd-

Carathiarim) sjx-ak of it, in their day, as a villaf*

9 or 10 M. P. from Jerusalem, on the way to Iltos-

polis (l.ytlda). Dr. Itobinson (BSd. Res. voL ii.

pp. 334—337) has identified it with the prew-nl

Kuryet-eW Ent'ib, on the road to Ramleh. The

monks have found the Anatiuitii of Jeremiah

(i. 1 ; comp. nicron. in Inc.; Onomast. i. r.; Jocrpb.

Ant. x. 7. § 3), which is now represented by the

modern 'Anatn at Ktiryrt-tl-'Ewih, but the eccle­

siastical tradition is evidently incorrect. There was

formerly here a convent of the Minorites, with a

Latin church. The latter remains entirely dewrted,

but not iu ruins; and is one of the largest and most

solidly constructed churches in Palestine. (Hitter,

Ertlbtude, vol. xvi. pp. 108—110.)

6. Kiiuatii-Sepiikr, or "city of lh» cm**

(Josh. xv. 15,16 ; Judg. i. 11), also called KllUAni-

Samsaii, " city of palms." (JmA xv. 49.) At:irwa.Tl»

it took the name of Dkbir (AcSiu, I.XX.). a " wu-J"

or "oracle." Debir was captured by Josliua (x.

38), but being afterwards retaken by thcCanaaait'i.
