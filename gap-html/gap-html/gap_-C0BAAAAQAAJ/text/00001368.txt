town with water. There are also remains of a Ro­

man citadel. On a hill which commands Vesunna,

and is separated from it by the river file, there are

the remains of a Roman camp, which is called Camp

dc Cesar, though Caesar never was there; but

some of his successors may have been. There are

several other Roman camps about Perhjimtx. Se­

veral Human roads have been traced leading to Peri-

gueux. Vesunna seems to have been an important

position in Aquitania during the imperial govern­

ment of Rome. There is a French work on the

VESUVIUlS MONS (Ovetrovios, or OvcvovGios:

Mrmte Vesuvi6)y sometimes also called by Latin

writers Vesevts, and Vf.svius or Vesbits (Be'cr-

6toy, Dion Cass.), a celebrated volcanic mountain of

Campania, situated on the shore of the gulf called

the Crater or Bay of Kaples, from which it rises

directly in an isolated conical mass, separated on all

sides from the ranges of the Apennines by a broad

tract of intervening plain. It rises to the height of

4020 feet, and its ba.se is nearly 30 miles in cir­

cumference.

Though now celebrated for the frequency as well

as violence of its eruptions, Vesuvius had in ancient

times been so long in a quiescent state that all tra­

dition of its having ever been an active volcano was

lost, and until after the Christian era it was noted

chiefly for the great fertility of the tract that ex­

tended around its base and up its sloping sides

(Virg. Georg. ii. 227; Strab v. p. 247), a fertility

which was in great measure owing to the deposits of

fine volcanic sand and ashes that had been thrown

out from the mountain. There were not indeed

wanting appearances that proved to the accurate

observer the volcanic origin and nature of Vesuvius:

hence IHodorus speaks of it as " bearing many signs

of its having been a burning mountain in timed long

past " (Diod. iv. 21); but though he considers it as

having on this account given name to the Phlegraean

plains, he does not allude to any historical or tra­

ditional evidence of Its former activity. Strabo

in like manner describes it as "surrounded by

fields of the greatest fertility, with the exception

of the summit, which was for the most part

level, and wholly barren, covered with allies, and

containing clefts and hollows, formed among rocks

of a burnt aspect, as if they had been eaten away by

fire; so that a person would be led to the conclusion

that the spot had formerly been in a state of con­

flagration, and had craters from which fire had burst

forth, but that these had been extinguished for want

of fuel" (v. p. 247). He adds that the great fer­

tility of the neighbourhood was very probably owing

to this cause, as that of Catana was produced by

Mount Aetna. In consequence of this fertility, as

well as of the beauty of the adjoining bay, the line of

coast at the foot of Vesuvius was occupied by several

flourishing towns, and by numbers of villas belong­

ing to wealthy Roman nobles.

The name* of Vesuvius is twice mentioned in his­

tory before the Christian era. In u. c. 340 it was

at the foot of this mountain that was fought the

great battle between the Romans and the Latins, in

which P. Decius devoted himself to death for his

country. (Liv. viii. 8.) The precise scene of the

action is indeed uncertain, though it was probably

iu the plain on the N. hide. Livy describes it as

"baud procul radieibus Vesuvii mentis, qua via ad

Veserim ferebat;" but the situation of the Veseris is

■wholly uncertain. [Vksekls.J A^aia. it i 'xr
