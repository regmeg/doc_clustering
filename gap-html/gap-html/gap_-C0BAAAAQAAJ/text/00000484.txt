It whs destroyed by the Huns under Attila (Priseus,

(Proeop. iv. 1, where it is called Naisopolis). It

still exists under the name of Nissa, upon the river

Atssava. an affluent of the Morava.

NAMADUS (Nctuaoys, or Na^ao"?]?, Ptol. vii. 1,

§§ 5, 31, 62, 65), a great river of Western India,

which, alter rising in the M. Vindius ( Viiulhya

Mountains), fulls into the S. Barygazenus (Gulf of

Cambay), not far from the town of Beroack. In the

J'< ripl. M. Erytkr. (Gtoyr. Crate, vol. i. p. '29 1. ed.

Muller) the river is called Nainnadius (NattiaWv).

'I lie present name is Xertmdda, which, like the

(ireek form, is doubtless derived from the Sanscrit

NaritiAtla, "pleasant." (Forbes, Oriental Mem.

were a Galhe people on the north >i<W. of the lager

{Loire), mid on the sea. The liver separated them

from tli" Pietones or Pictavi. (Strab. iv. p. 190,)

Their chief town was Condivicnuin (-.Van/e^). When

Caesar was carrying on his war with the Veneti,

these maritime Galli called in to their aid the

Osismi, Xannetes, and oilier neighbouring people.

diocese of Xantts exceeded the limits of the territory

NANTUATES, a people who bordered on the

AHobroges, who in Caesar's time were included

within the limits of the Provincia. Caesar (ii. a.

iii. 1) at the close of the campaign -of ii. c. 57 sent

iscrvius Galba with tome troops into the country of

the "Nantuates Yeragri and Seduni, who extend

from the borders of the Allobroges, the I.acus

Lemannus and the river Phone to tlie summits of

tlie Alps." The position of the Seduni in the vuliev

of the Phone about Sitten or Sion, and of the

Veragri lower down at Martiyny or Marlinachy 1

being ascertained, we must place the Nantuates in

the CJtabUits, on the .south side of the heman lake,

a position which is conformable to Cae>ar's text.

Strabo (iv. p. *204) who probably pot ids information

from Caesar's work, speaks "of the Yeragri, Nan-

tuatae, and the Leman lake;" from which we

might infer that the Xautuates were near the lake.

An inscription in honour of Augustus, which ac­

cording to Guichenon's testimony was found at

Maurice, which is in the1 ValaU lower down than

Martiyny, contains the words "Nantuates patrono;"

and if the inscription belongs to the spot where it is

found, it is some evidence that the Xautuates were

in the lower part of the ValaU. lint if the Nan- I

tuates were neighbours of the Allobroges, they must

have extended westward along the south bank of

the hike into the Chablais. The Chabltmh that

part of Savoy which lies along the Lemuo lake

between the Arre and the ValaU. It is not reruin

how fur the Allobroges extended along th* Lemsa

lake cast of Geneva, which town was in tber

territory. It has been observed, that the wcrt

Kant in the Celtic language signifies *' ninnir.;

water;" and it is said that in the dialect of Swot,

every little mountain stream is called Ann.', -ta

that there are many streams of this name. .Yaai

is also a Welsh word for stream.

There is another passage, in Caesar, wb.er? \fc

name Nantuates occurs in tlie common text- (& G

iv. 10). which has caused great difficulty. Hf uti

that the Rhenus rises in The country of the Lep!0t:i

who occupy the Alps, and that it flows hy a tocj

distance (longo spatio) tlirough the country »i tin

Nantuates, Helvetii. and others. YValckei.aer affin I

(Gtag. tfc. vol. i. p. 558) that the best and &

greater part of the MSS. of Caesar have Vatu»:ium

but this is not true. The readings in this p&ssafi

are Xanluatium, Natuantium, Vatuantinm. )Ua

tuanttum, and some otiier varieties. (Caesar,

Schneid.) Strab..(iv. p. 192) >ays that the Actoat*

(Airot/uTai) inhabit the first part of the eoun* <

the Khine, and that the souice.s of the river ar

in their country near Mount Adulas. Ca-sanyji

changed A<-tuatae into Xantuatae to make it lgr*

with Caesar's text, and Cluver changed it hit

Helvetii. Both changes are opposed to sound cn'i

eism. The name in Caesars text is not e?ru^

. ami in Strabo it may be wrong, but nothing i

plainer than that these people, whatever is tea

name, are in the valley of the Rhine, OberUn i
