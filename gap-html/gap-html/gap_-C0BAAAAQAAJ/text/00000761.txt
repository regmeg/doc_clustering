the Triphylian towns in Homer (Z. c.)

PTE'KIA (riTtpla), the name of a town and dis­

PTOLEMA'IS. 1. (tiToAvaft Ptol. iv. 5 §

57), a small town of the Arsiuoite nomc in Middle

Aegypt. It was situated between Heracleopolis

Magna and Arsinoe, near the point of junction bc-

twecu the Bahr Jusef'and the Nile. The modern

village of EL Lahum occupies a portion of the site

of the Arsinoite Ptolemais.

2. Ptolemais Theron (riToAe/uair &ripur, Ptol.

Strab. xvii. pp. 768—76 ; Agatharch. ap. P/tvt.

pp. 457—459, ed. Bekkcr; Ptolemais Epitheras, Plin.

vi. 29. s. 34), was originally an Aethiopian village

situated on the southern skirts of the forest which

extended from the S. side of the Troglodytic Bere­

nice to lat. 17° N. Its convenient situation on the

coast of the Red Sea and in the heart of the region

where elephants abounded induced Ptolemy Phila-

delpbus (b. o. 282—246) to occupy, enlarge, and

fortify the village, which thenceforward was named

Ptolemais after its second founder. Philadelphia,

indeed, before he colonised this outpost of his king­

dom, used every effort to persuade the Actbiopiau

hunters [ELEniAHToriiAoi] to abstain from the

flesh of these animals, or to reserve a portion at

least of them for the royal stables. But they re­

jected his offers, replying that for the kingdom of

Aegypt they would not forego the pleasure of hunt­

ing and eating elephants. Hitherto the Aegyptians

had imported these animals from Asia, the Asiatic

breed being stronger and larger than the African.

But the supply was precarious; the cost of import­

ation was great; and the Aethiopian forests afforded

an ample supply both for war and the royal house­

hold. As the depot of the elephant trade, including

that also in hides and ivory, Ptolemais attained a

high degree of prosperity, and ranked among the

principal cities of Aethiopia. From its market it

is probable that Carthage also derived its supply of

elephants, since about the period of Philadelphia'

reign the Carthaginians employed these animals

more frequently in war. (Liv. xvii. Epit. \ Florus, ii.

2. §28.)Ptolemaishad, properly speaking, no harbour,

and the Ae^-yptian vessels were compelled to run up

to Berenice whenever the N. or E. winds prevailed;

in the present day the Red Sea coast at this point is

approachable only by boats. The roadstead of Pto­

lemais, however, was partially sheltered from the E.

winds by an island corered with olive-trees. In its
