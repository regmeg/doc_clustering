the modem name lends an appearance of confirma­

tion to this hypothesis by its resemblance to Justini­

tice Ulpiana and Pautalia as distinct places, is an

insurmountable objection to this hypothesis [TJl.ri-

ana.] Stephanus of Byzantium has a district called

Paetaua (riaiToAlo), which he assigns to Thrace,

probably a false reading. (Leake, Northern Grace,

vol. iii. p. 425.) [E. B.J.]

PAX JULIA (n&l 'louMo, Ptol. ii. 5. § 5; called

in the Geogr. Rav., iv. 43, Pacca Julia), a town of

the Turdetani, in the S. of Lusitania, ami on the

road from Esuris to Ebora (/fin. Ant. pp. 426. 427).

But on the subject of this route see Lusitania,

Vol. II. p. 220. It was a Iioman colony, and the

seat of a Conventus juridicus (Plin. iv. 35); probahly

the same town as that called Pax Augusta by Strnbo

(iii. p. 151),— as many towns bore double names in

this manner, — notwithstanding that it is placed by

him among the Cellici. (Ukert, v h ii. pt. 1. p. 388,

and the authorities there cited.) It lay on a hill

K. of Julia Myrtilis, and ia commonly identified with

Beja. [T. H. D.]

PAXI (ITa£ol), the name of two small islanils,

now called Paxo and Antipaxo, situated between

Corcyra and Leucas. (Polyb. ii. 10; Plin. iv. 12.

s. 19; Hi-n Cass. 1. 12.)

PEDAEUM or PEDAEUS (nt)Jaioi<). a place

mentioned by Homer (//. xiii. 172), which is said

by Eustathius to have been a town in Troas; but it

is otherwise entirely uuknown. [L. S.]

PEDA'LIE, a place on the coast of Cilicia, be­

tween Pinara and Ale, is mentioned only by Pliny

(v. 22), and its exact site is unknown. [L. S.]

PEDA'LIUM (riTjSdAio*'), a promontory in the

south-east of Caria, funning the southernmost point

of the western coast of the Sinus Glaucus. (Pomp.

Mela, i. 16; Plin. v. 29; Sludiatm. Mar. Magn.

§§ 228, 233, 234.) Strabo (xiv. p. 651) gives to

the same promontory the name of Arteinisium, from

a temple of Artemis, which stood upon it; its

modern name is Bvkontadhi. (Leake, Asia Minor,

p. 223, foil.) [L. S.]

PE'DASA (n<«oiro: Eth. Tl-ritaotvi). also called

PEDASL'II (Plin. v. 29), an ancient city of Caria,

in which the Persians suffered a defeat during the

revolt of the Ionians. (Herod, v. 121, vi. 20.) It

was once the chief seat of the Leleges. Alexander

the Great deprived the place of its independence by

giving it over to the Halicarnassians, together with

five other neighbouring towns. (Plin. /. c.) In the

time of Strabo (xiii. p. 611) the town had censed to

exist, and the name of the district, Pedasis (flTjo

oit), was the only remaining memorial of the place.

(Comp. Polyb. xviii. 27; Stcph. B. «. «.) As He­

rodotus assigns to Pedasa a portion of tlie territory

of Miletus, it is clear that the town must have been

situated between Miletus, Halicarnassus, ami Strato-

niceia; but its exact site is still only matter of con­

jecture, some placing it at the modern Melasso, and

others at Arabi //war, neither of which supposi­

tions is free from inconsistencies. [L. S.]

PE'IiASUS (n^oWoj), a small town of Mysia,

on the river Satnioeis, which is mentioned by Homer

(/I. vi. 35, xx. 92, xxi. 87), but was deserted in the

time of Strabo (xiii. p. 605), who (p. 584) mentions

it among the towns of the Leleges, which were de­

stroyed by Achilles. (Comp. Steph. B. ». v. Ylifcana.

Pliny (v. 32) imagines that Pedasus was the same

place as that which subsequently bore the name of

Adramyttium; but as Homer distinctly places it of
