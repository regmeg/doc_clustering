1332 UXELLODUNUM.

dhsolu made by M. Cornnau, at the request of

Turgot does not torrespond to the description in the

Gallic War, lor the river Tonrmente washes only

one of the four sides of this hill; he also says, that

nothing appears easier than to turn the river towards

the west on the north side of the town, and to pre­

vent its course being continued to the south. But

the author of the eighth book of the Gallic War

says that Caesar could not deprive the defenders of

UzeUodnnnm of the water of the river by diverting

its course,4i for the river flowed at the very foot of

the heights of Uxellodunum, and could not be drawn

olF in any direction by sinking ditches." There is a

plan of Capdeiiac in Caylus' Antiquttis (torn. v.

pL 100, p. 280), and Walckenaer observes that

this also corresponds very imperfectly with the de­

scription. The researches of Chainpollion (Arou-

velks Recherche* sur L'xellodunum), which are

cited by Walckenaer, appeared in 1820. Waleke-

naer makes some objection to Capdenuc, on grounds

which are not very strong. He says that the Lot

is above 300 feet wide where it surrounds Capdettac,

and one cannot conceive howarcbera placed on one bank

could have prevented the besieged from getting water

on the other side. If the archers and shngers were on

the river in boats or rafts, which is likely enough,

this objection is answered, even if it be true that an

archer or linger could not kill a man at the dis­

tance of 300 feet. Walckenaer makes some other

objections to Capdaiac, but they are mainly founded

on a misunderstanding or a perversion of the Latin

text.

It is possible that we have not yet found Uxello-

dunum, but a journey along the banks of the Lot,

for that is more probably the river, might lead to

the discovery of this interesting site of Caesars last

great military operation in Gallia. The position of

the place, the attack, and the defence, are well de­

scribed; and it cannot be difficult to recognise the

site, if a man should see it before his eyes. Nothing

could be easier to recognise than Alesia, It is im­

possible for any man to doubt about the site of

Alesia who has seen Alise [Mandubii]. In the

case of Uxellodunum, we have not the help of a cor­

responding modern name, unless it be a place not

yet discovered. [G. L.]
