permit. Servius had formed the different Vici into

religious corporations somewhat analogous with our

parishes, with an appointed worship of the Lares,

and proper feasts or Compitalia. During the Re­

public these corporations became a kind of political

tlubs, and were often made the engines of designing

demagogues. (Preller. Hegionett, p. 81.) Au­

gustus, in his new distribution, also adopted the

scheme of embodying the Vici as religious corpora­

tions, and for this purpose erected chapels in the

cross ways, and set up images of the gods ricat'mi, as

the Apollo Sandaliarius and the Jupiter Tragoedus.

(Suet. Aug. ."j7.) Many bases of these statues have

l>cen discovered. By the term Vicus we are to

understand a certain collection of houses insulated

by streets running round all its sides; whence the

term came also to be applied to the streets themselves

(" altera vici appellantur. cum id genus aedificiorum

definitur, quae continent ia sunt in oppidis, qua eve

itineribus regionihusqne distribute inter se distant,

nominibusque dissitnilibus discriminis causa sunt

dispartita" Fest. p. 371, et ibi Miill). Compitnm,

which means properly a cross-road, was also,

especially in ancient times, only another name for

Vicus; and thus we rind Pliny describing Rome

as divided into Compita Larum instead of Vici (in.

9). The Vici and Compita. regarded as streets,

were narrrower than the Viae and Plateae. (Suet.

Aug. 45; Amin. Marc, xxviii. 4. $ 29.) They were

named after temples and other objects. The Vici

were composed of two classes of houses called respec­

tively insulae and domus. The former were so called

because, by a law of the XII. Tables, it was ordained

that they should be separated from one another by an

interval of 2^ feet, called ambUm, and by later authors

ciradtus (Varr. L.L. v. § 22, Miill; Paul. Diac. p.

Hi, 111 Miill.) This law, which seems to have been

deigned for purposesof health and for security against

fire, was disregarded during the Republic, but again

enforced by Nero when he rebuilt the city (Tac. Ann.

xv. 43); and there is an ordinance on the subject by

Antoninus and Verus{Dig. viii. 2. 14). By insulae,

therefore, we an' to understand single houses divided

by a small space from the neighbouring ones, not

a complex of houses divided by streets. The latter

division formed a Vicus. Yet some insulae were so

large and deposed in such a manner that they almost

resembled Vici (vide Feat p. 371. et ibi Midi).

The insulae wen- inhabited by the middling and lower

classes, and were generally let out in floors ("coena-

cula meritoria," Dig. xix. 2. 30). It appears from

the same authority that they were farmed by persons

who underlet tliem; but sometimes the proprietors

kept stewards to collect their rents. Insulae were

named after their owners, who were called ''domini

insularum" (Suet. Cars. 41. Tib. 48). Thus we

bear of the insula Eucarpiana, Critonia, Arriana,

Sec. (vide Grater, 611. 13 ; Murat. 948. 9.) Kent

was high (Juv. iii. 166), and investments in houses

consequently profitable, though hazardous, since the

principle of insurance was altogether unknown.

(Gel), xv. 1, 2.) Crassus was a great speculator in

houses, and was said to possess nearly hall Koine.

(1*1 at. c. 2.) The domus, on the contrary, were the

habitations or palaces of the rich and great, and

consequently much fewer in number than the insulae,

the proportion in each Region being as 1 to 2o or 30.

The domus were also common!)' insulated, but not by

any special law, like the insulae. They were also

composed of floors or stages, but were occupied by a

bingle family (Petron. 77); though parts of them,

especially the poetic*, were sometime* Vt (*>X {V-C
