1318 VOLATERRAK UNELLI.

has a coarse of above 50 miles in a SSW. direction

till it Hows into the Tyrrhenian sea, about 16 miles

N. of the promontory of Monte Argentaro. Pliny

terms it a navigable river (" uavigiorum capax"),

and Rutilins describes it as forming at its mouth

a tranquil and secure port. (Plin.iii. 5. s. 8;

Rutil. Jtin. i. 337—340.) It flows near the modem

city of Gro&seto, and within a few miles of theruins

of Rusellae. The name of Umbro is considered to

be connected with the Umbrians, who held this

part of Italy previous to its conquest by the Etrus­

cans : and according to Pliny, the coast district ex­

tending from its mouth to Telamon, was still known

as the " tractus Umbriae." (Plin. /. c.) [E. H. Ii.]

UNELLI or VENELI (OveVeAoi). one of the Ar-

moric or maritime states of Gallia. (B. G. ii. 34, iii.

11.) Caesar mentions them with the Veneti, Osismi,

Cunosolitae, and other maritime states, The Upelli

and the rest submitted to P. Crassus in B.C. 57; but

in B.C. 5G it was necessary to send a force again into

the country of the UnelH, Curiosolitae, and Lexovii.

Q. liturius Sabinus had the command of the three

legions who were to keep the UnelH and their neigh-

bouts quiet. The commander of the Unelli was Viri-

dovix, and he was also at the head of all the forces

of the states which had joined the Unelli, among

whom were the Aulerci Eburovicea ami the Lexovii.

The force oi Viridovi* was very large, and he was

joined by desj*_-rate men from all parts of Gallia,

robbers and those who were too idle totiil the ground.

The Roman general entrenched himself in his camp,

and made the Galli believe that he was afraid and

was intending to slip away by night. The trick

deceived the Galli, and they attacked the Roman

camp, which was well placed on an eminence w ith a

sloping ascent to it about a mile in length. On the

Galli reaching the Roman camp exhausted by a

rapid march up the hill and encumbered with the

fascines which they carried for tilling up the ditch,

the Romans tallied out by two gates and punished

the enemy well for their temerity. They slaughtered

an immense number of the Galli, and the cavalry

pursuing the remainder let few escape. This clever

(cut of arms is told clearly in the Commentaries.

The L'uelli s«*nt a contingent of 6000 men to

attack Caesar at the siege of Alesia. (#. G. vii.

75.)

Ptolemy (ii, 8. § 2) names Crociatonum the

capi;al of the Veneli. [Crooiatonum.] The

people occupied the peninsula of CoUmtin orCoUntin,

which is now comprehended in the department of

La MdttcJte, except a small part which is included in

the department of Calvados. [G. L-]

(Ann. i. 70). a river in the north-west of Germany;

hut the correct reading in that passage is ad Ami-

singin being only a conjecture of Altmg manufactured

out of the modern name of a river called Unse or

I/uitse. [L. S.J
