1030 TAXUS. TAPOSIHS.

Mid marsh fever prevent all bnt a few fishermen

from inhabiting it. The mounds which cover the

site of Tanis are very high and of great extent,

being upwards of a mile from north to south, and

nearly three quarters of a mile from east to west.

The arm in which the sacred enclonure of the temple

of Pthah stood is about 1500 feet in length by

1250 broad. The enclosure, which is of crude

brick, is 1000 feet long and about 700 wide. A

gateway of granite or fine gritstone, bearing the

name of Barneses the Great, stands on the northern

side of this enclosure. The numerous obelisks and

the greater part of the sculptures of the temple

were contributed by Ramcses. His name is also

inscribed on two granite columns outside the en­

closure, and apparently unconnected with the temple. |

Though in a very ruinous condition, the fragments

of walls, columns, and obelisks sufficiently attest

the former splendour of this building. The archi­

tecture is generally in the best style of Aegyptian

art, and the beauty of the lotus-bud and palm ca­

pitals of the columns is much celebrated by tra­

vellers. Among the deities worshipped at Tanis

were Pthah (Hephaestus), Mailt, lia, Horns, &c.

The Pharaohs who raised these monuments were

of various dynasties, ranging from the kings of the

xviiith dynasty to the Aethiopian Tirhaka. The

numerous remains of glass and pottery found here,

and the hog* mounds of brick, prove that the civil

portions of Tanis were commensurate in extent and

population with the religious. The modern village

of San consists of mere huts. Early in the present

century an attempt was made to establish nitre-

works there; but they have been long abandoned;

and the only occupation of the few inhabitants of

this once flourishing city is fishing. North of the

town, and between it and the coast of the Medi­

terranean, was the lake Tanis, the present Menza-

kh, (Wilkinson, Mod. Egypt and Thebes, vol. i.

TA'OCE (Taowi, Arrian, Ind. c. 39; Strab. xv.

p. 72vS), a town or fortress of the district of Tao-

cenc, in Persia. It was, according to Strabo, the

seat of one of the three treasuries of the kings of

Persia. It is not certain from Arrian's statement

whether lie means the town or the district, but

probably the former. The town appears to have

been placed near the river Grants. Ptolemy speaks

of a promontory and a town of this name (vi. 4.

§>$ 2 and 7). It is probable that it is the same

place as that called by Al-Edrisi, Toudj or Touj

(ii. p. 391, &c). Where Dionysius (1069), enu­

merating the three palaces, speaks of the Teur/cof,

we ought most likely to read Twjcoi or Taxoi,

with reference to the people of this district. The

Grains is the river of Abushir. [Grams.] [V.]
