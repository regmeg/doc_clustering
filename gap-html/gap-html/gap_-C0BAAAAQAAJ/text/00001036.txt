SEGESTA (%4y«rra: Elk. Xty«rra.v6s, Segcs-

tanus: Ru. near Calatafimi), a city of Sicily in the

N\V. part of the island, about 0 miles distant from the

sea, and 34 W. of Panormus. Its name is always

written by the Attic and other contemporary Greek

writers Eg EST A {"Eyfara: Eth. 'Eyeardios, Thnc.

&c), and it has heme been frequently asserted that

it whs first changed to Segesta by the Romaus, for

the purpose of avoiding tlie ill omen of the name of

Egesta in Latin, (Fest. s r. Segesta, p. 340.) This

story is, however, disproved by its coins, which

prove that considerably before the time of Thucy-

dides it was called by the inhabitants themselves

Segesta, though ibis form seems to have been

softened by the Greeks into Eiresta. The origin

and foundation of Segesta is extremely objure. The

tradition current among tlie Greeks and a-lopted by

Thucydides (Time. vi. 2; Dionys. i. 52: Strab. xiii.

p. 603), ascribed its foundation to a band of Trojan

settlers, fugitives from the destruction of their city;

and this tradition was readily welcomed by the

Romans, who in consequence claimed a kindred

origin with the Segestans. Thucydides seems to

have considered the Ely mi, a barbarian tribe in the

neighbourhood of Eryx and Segesta, as descended

from the Trojans in question ; but another account

represents the Ely mi as a distinct people, already

existing in this part of Sicily when the Trojans

arrived there and founded the two cities. [Elymi.]

A different story seems also to hav e been current,

according to which Segesta owed its origin to a

band of Phocians, who had been among the followers

of Philoctetes; and, as usual, later writers sought to

reconcile the two accounts. (Strab. vi. p. 272;

Thuc. /. t\) Another version of the Trojan story,

which would seem to have been that adopted by

the inhabitants themselves, ascribed the foundation

of the city to Egesttis or Aeeestus (the Acestcs of

Virgil), who was said to be the offspring of a Trojan

damsel named Segesta by the river god Crimisus.

(Serv. ad A en. i. 550. v. 30.) We are told also

that the names of Simois and Scamander were given

by the Trojan colonists to two small streams which

flowed beneath the town (Strab. xiii. p. 608); and

the latter name is mentioned by Diodorus as one

still in use at a much later ]»eriod. (Diod. xx. 71.)

It is certain that we cannot receive the statement

of the Trojan origin of Segesta as historical; but what-

ever be the origin of the tradition, tb«r sw-j *-->

doubt on the one hand that the city wisocnpwJ b*i

people distinct from the Sicamans. the nitise nrf 4

this part of Sicily, and on the other that it wi>

a Greek colony. Thucydides, in «i'jn>TV. a: '>

allies of the Athenians at the time of the

nesian War, distinctly calls the Segrstict feart*-

rians; and the history of the Greek colocn a

Sicily was evidently recorded with siuficietit aam

accuracy for us to rely upon his aatlncitT wb*n a

with the Greek cities of Sicily, and ent^nsr =3*

relations both of hostility and alliarte mlti trt

Hellenic states, wholly different from the a'v:
