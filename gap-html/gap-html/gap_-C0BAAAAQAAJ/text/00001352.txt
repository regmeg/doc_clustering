126S VELTXUS.

VELITRAE.

a marshy pool which still exists between the ruins of

the ancient city and the mouth of the A lento. This

river itself, however, was sufficient to afford a shelter

and place of anchorage for shipping in ancient times

(Cicm/ Att. xvi. 7), and is still resorted to for the

same purpose by the light vessels of the country.

Nn other ruins exist on the site of the ancient city

except some masses of buildings, which, being in the

reticulated style, are unquestionably of Roman date:

portions of aqueducts, reservoirs for water. &c. are

also visible. (The site and existing remains of

Velia are described by Mtinter, Velia in Luamien,

8vo. Alton a, 1818, pp. 15—20, and by the Due do

Luynes, in the Annali dell1 Jwttituto, 1829, pp.

381—38(3.)

It is certain that as a Greek colony Velia never

rose to a par with the more opulent and flunriidiing

cities of Magna Gniecta. Its chief celebrity in an­

cient times Wits derived front its celebrated school of

philosophy, which was universally known as the

Eleatic school. Its founder Xenophnncs w:us indeed

a native of Colophon, but had established himself at

Velia, anil wrote a long poem, in which he celebrated

the foundation of that city. (Diog. Laert. ix. 2. §

'20.) His distinguished successors Parnienides and

Zeno were both of them born nt Velia, and the same

thing is asserted by some writers of Leucippus, the

founder of the atomic theory, though others repre­

sent him as a native of Ahdera or Melos. Hence

Diogenes Laert ins terms Velia "an inconsiderable

city, but capable of producing great men" (ix. 5. §

28). [E. H. B.]

COIN OF YKLIA.

VELINUS (Vtlino), a considerable river of

Central Italy, which has its sources in the lofty

group of the Apennines between Nursia (A'orcta)

and Interocrea (Antrodoco)* Its actual source is

in the immediate neighbourhood of the ancient

Falacrinum, the birthplace of Vespasian, where an

old church still bears the name of Sta Marui di

Font? Velino. The up]>er part of its course is

from N. to S.; but near Antrodoco it turns abrupily

to the W . pursues that direction as far as Hteii,

and theme Hows about NNW. till it discharges its

waters into the Nar (Xera) about 3 miles above

Terni (Interamna). Just before reaching that

river it forms the celebrated cascade now known as

the Falls of Tend or Cascaia delle Mar move.

This waterfall is in its present form wholly arti­

ficial. It was h'rst formed by M\ Curius Deutatus,

who opened an artificial channel for the waters of

the Velinus, and thus carried off a considerable

part of the Lac us Velinus, which previously occu­

pied a great part of the valley below Re&te. There

still remained, however, as there does to this day, a

considerable lake, called the Laens Velinus, and

now known as the Lago di Pie di Lugo. It was

on the banks of this lake that the villa of Axius,

the friend of Cicero and Varro, was situated. (Cic.

ad All. iv. 15; Varro, HR. ii. 1, 8.) Several

smaller lakes still exist a little higher up the

valley: hence we find Pliny speaking in the plural

of the Vfxixt Lacus (Plin. iii. 12. s. IT; Tat

Ann. i. 79; Vib. Seq. p. 24.) The chancier ibi

conformation of the lower valley of the Veknai an

VELITKAE (Ov4\trpax: F.tK Ow\n^

Veliternna: Vdlctri), a city of Latium sitaazfti a

the sonthern slope of the Alban hills, lovkuu «

the Pomptine Slashes, and on the left of theVi*

Appia. There can be no doubt that it wjv3 a .i- <

within the limits of LatiumT as that iiame was 03^7

understood, at least in later times: but there es mat

uncertainty as to whether it was orinriaiW 1 Lasa

1 or a Volscian city. On the oue hand Dmsiam

includes the Veliterni in his list of the thrrty ..is

I of the Latin League, a document prvbabiy 6e-.*?i

I from good authority (Dionya. v. 61). On the <zhx

'hand both Dionysin* himself and Livy reparsc:-:

Velitrae as a Volscian city at the earliest period ^i*

it came into collision with Rome. Thus Drst***.

in relating tlie wars of Ancus Martins w.:..

Vol-cians, speaks of Velitrae as a city of th.it ye*

which was besieged by the Roman kinc, fe*i ^>

nutted, and was received to an alliance go &ramafc

terms. (Id. iii. 41.) Again in 11. c. 494. ;ost i>»:

the period when its name figures in Dkamiai *

one of the Latin cities, it is mentioned b<>tjh fcr us*

author and by Livy as a Volscian city, wkxa ru

wrested from that people by the consul P. Vinrsji

(Id. vi. 42 ; Lit. ii. 30). According to Utj a Io­

nian colony was sent there the same year, w^i.:

again recruited with fresh colonists two year*

wards. (Liv. ii. 31, 34.) Dionysius, on the cuan?

makes no mention of the first colony, and irpran^

that sent in B- c, 492 as designed to snpfJy u* tx-

hausted population of Velitrae, which Lad lies rc-

duced to a low state by a pestilence. (Dinars, vi

13, 14.) It appears certain at all rrents thai Vo>

trae received a Human colony at this period ; ber, s

had apparently again fallen into decay, as -it rem.*?)*

a second body of colonist* in it. c. 404. (LteaL s.**-

34.) Even this did not suffice to secure in

giance to Rome: shortly after the Gaulish war.

Human colonists of Velitrae joined with the V .isaa

in their hostilities, and after a short tiro*? br-jfaf *t

into open revolt. (Liv. vi. 13, 21.) Tbev *yrr «-
