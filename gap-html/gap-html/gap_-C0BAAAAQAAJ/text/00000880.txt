XaJ\nt%iKln' uvonavfifvoy, in order to prop ;i tlieory

which cannot support itself. We need not, there­

fore, enter further into this view. That of flecker

(//aw//>. p. 33.5) seems probable enough, that the

Chalcidieum usurped the place of the senaeulum ot

tho curia, though we should be more inclined to

say that <>f the (Iraccostasis, as the position of the

hitter seems at all events to have been shifted about

tins period. We learn from Pliny (xxxiii. 6)

that in his time it no longer stood "supra Comi­

tium." Vet such a place seems to have existed to

llie latent ]ieri"d. and is mentioned in the Xttfitta

(Hegio viii.) under the altered name of Graeco-

sUdiuin, close to the Basilica Julia, though the

MSS. vary with regard to tlie position. It had

probably, therefore, been removed before the time of

Pliny to the south side of the forum, and perhaps

at the time when the new curia and Chalcidieum

were built. If this was so, it would tend to prove

that the comitium did nor extend across the whole

breadth nf the forum. The Atrium Minervae of

the Nvtitia must have been of a later period.

Another change in the disposition of the forum,

with reference to the politics of the times, which

was actually carried out by Caesar in his lifetime,

was the removal of the ancient rostra. The co­

mitium, which may be called the aristocratic part

of the forum, had become in a great measure de­

serted. The popular business was now transacted

at the lower end of the forum; and Caesar, who

courted the mob, encouraged this arrangement. The

steps of the temple of Castor had been converted

into a sort of extempore rostra, whence the dema­

gogues harangued the people, and Caesar himself

had sometimes held forth from them. (Dion Cass,

xxxviii, 6; cf. Cie.p, Sest, 15; App. B. C. iii. 41.)

Dion Cassius expressly mentions that the Rostra

were changed by Caesar (xliii. 49). The change

is also mentioned by Asconius: "Erant enim tunc

rostra non eo loco quo nunc sunt, sed ad Comitium

prope juncta Curiae" (W Cic. Mil. 5), where, by

this absolute and unqualified mention of the curia,

he must of course have meant the curia existing in

his time, which was the Julia; and this shows that

it stood on the ancient site of the Hostilia. Another

proof that the rostra were moved in Caesars life­

time may be derived from Livy (Ejrit. cxvi.):

"Caesaris corpus a plebe ante Rostra crematum

est." For, as Appian (/?. C. ii. 148) indicates the

place in another manner, and says that the burning

of the body took place before the Regia, it is plain

that the rostra mentioned in the Epitome just cited

must have been very near the Uegia, But we have

seen that the ancient rostra were on the comitium,

at the other end of the forum. There are other

passages from which we may arrive at the exact

situation uf the new rostra. Thus Suetonius, in

his account of the funeral of Augustus, says that a

panegyric was pronounced uj-ou him by Drusus from

the rostra under the Tabernae Veteres (" pro Rostris

sub Veteribus* Aug. 100; cf. Dion Cass. Ivi. 34).

It should be stated, however, that the common

reading of this passage is "pro Rostris veteribus,"

t.iat is, from the old rostra un the comitium; and

we shall see further on that the old rostra appear |

to have existed after the erection of tin- new. It is j

not, however, probable that they would be u»ed on

this occasion, even if they were ever used at all;

and wo see from Dion Cassias/a account of the

funeral of Octavia, the sister of AnnstaL thai

Drusus also on that occasion projmmni * ?a*-
