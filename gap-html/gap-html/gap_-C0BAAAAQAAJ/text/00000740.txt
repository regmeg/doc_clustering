must have been si touted in the district of the Pon­

tine Marshes, and was probably merely the name of

some portion of the swamps included under that

more general designation.

The line of the Appian Way was carried in a

perfectly straight line through the Pontine Marshes

from the station Sub Lanuvio, at the fi>ot of the

Alb.in Hills, to within a short distance of Tarracina.

The stations along its course and the distances are

differently given in the Itineraries; but they may all

he readily determined with the assistance of inscrip­

tions and Roman milestones still existing. At the

beginning of the marshes, or rather in the level

tract immediately adjoining them, was the station of

Tints Taukknak, distant 17 miles from Aricia, at

point where a branch road from Antium fell into

the Appian Way. The site of this was fixed by the

Abbe' Chaupy and other writers at a place called

Ia Castellf, 2 miles on the Roman side of Cisterma;

but there seems no reason to reject the distances

given in the Antoninc Itinerary, which would place

it 5 miles further from Home, or 3 miles beyond

Cisterna, where some ruins still remain, referred by |

Chaupy to the station Ad Sponsas of the Jerusalem

Itinerary, but which wuuld suit equally well for

those of Tres Tabernae. [Tit us Tabbbkab.]

Six miles from this spot, and just 39 miles from

Ii'ome (as shown by a milestone still remaining

there), is a place still called Torre tU Treptmti,

marking the site of TRBPOMTIirM, the spot from

whence the canal of the Dccennovium commenced,

and from which therefore the 19 miles from which

it derived its name were measured. Four miles

further on considerable remains mark the site of

FORUM Ami, which in the Augustan age was a

busy and thriving town; but in the fourth century

had sunk to a mere Mntatio or post station. The

Antonine Itinerary gives the distance from Rome to

Forum App'ii at 43 miles, which is exactly correct;

from thence to Tarracina it reckons 18 miles; the

Jerusalem Itinerary makes the distance 19 miles,

and give* an intermediate station called Ad Medias

(Paludes), which was 9 miles from Forum Appii

and 10 from Tarracina. The site of this is still

marked by a spot called Torre di Mesa, where a

striking Roman monument still remains; but the

real distance from Forum Appii is only 8 miles,

which coincides with the Antonine Itinerary, {/tin.

Ant. p. 107; Jtin. Hitr. p. 611.) The whole of

this part of the road has been carefully examined

and described by the Abbe' Chaupy {Decowcrte de

in Mcdton d'Horace, vol. iii. pp. 382—452); and

the distances discussed and corrected by Westphal,

{Rom. Kampat/ne, pp. 67—70). [E. H. 11.]

PONS AENI, or. as it is called in the Peuting.

Table, Ad Aenum, was a frontier fort in Yindelicia

on the river Aenus, and was garrisoned by a detach­

ment of cavalry. {It. Ant. pp. 236, 257; Not.

Imp.) It is commonly believed that its site is now

marked by the village of Pfunzen, which in the

middle ages bore the name of Pen tana; but Mnchar

{Soricum. i. p. 285) identities it with Emudorf

near Kraibtirf/. [L. S.]

PONS AERA'RIUS, in Gallia Xarboneusis, is

placed in the Jerusalem Itin. on the road from Xe-

of xii. from N emails us and viii. from Arelate. The

Antoninc [tin. marks xix. from Nemansns to Are­

late in one distance. The road must therefore have

been straight between these twu places. D'Anvjlle
