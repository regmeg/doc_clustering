424 NICAEA.

NIC EH.

to tlie E. of tli.it river, was naturally included in

Italy, anil is accordingly so described by Strabo

Pliny, and Ptolemy. (Strab. iv. p. 184; Plin. iii.

5. s. 7; Pt**l. iii. 1. § 2.) We have no account of

its early history, beyond the fact that it was a

colony of Manilla, and appear! to have continued

alwaja in a state of dependency upon that city.

(Strab. iv. pp. 180, 184; Plin, /. c; Steph. B.*.r.)

It was situated on the bordera of the LigurUn tribes

of the Oxybii and Decintes; and, as well as its

neighbour Antip>»lis, was continually harassed by

tin; incursions of these barbarians. In u. t'. 154

both cities wen? actually besieged by the Ligurians;

and the Massiliaus, finding themselves unable to re­

pulse the assailants, applied to Rome for assistance;

the consul Q. Opimius, who was despatched with

an army to tlieir succour, quickly compelled the

Liguri.tns to lay down their amis, and deprived them

of a considerable part of their territory, which was

annexed to the dependency of Manilla. (I'ol. xxxiii.

4, 7; Liv. Epit. xlvii.) From this time, nothing

more is heard in history of Nicaea. which continued

to belong to the jurisdiction of Masjilia, and, even

after it came to be subject to the Romans, and

included geographically in Italy, was still for munici­

pal purposes dependent upon its parent city. (Strab.

iv. p. 184.) At a later period, the new division of

the provinces again transferred to Gaul the towns of

Nicaea and Cemenelium, together with the whole

district of the Maritime Alps, westward of the

Tropaea Augnsti. Hence, we find Nicaea described

by Amrniamu (xv. 11. § 15) as belonging to Gaul;

and during the decline of the Empire, after it had

become an episcopal see, the names of its bishops are

found among the Gaulish prelates. It does not ap­

pear to have ever been a town of much importance

Under the Roman Empire; and waa apparently

eclipsed by the city of Cemenelium (CVmie;), in

its immediate neighbourhood. But it had a pood

pi>rt, which must always have secured it some share

of prosperity, and after the fall of Cemenelium, it

rose to be the most important city in this part of Gaul,

and became the capital of an independent district

called the Contmfa (fi Nizztt (County of Nice). This

eventually fell into the hands of the House of Savoy,

and now forms part of the dominions of the king of

Sardinia. Nice itself is a flourishing place, with

about 30,000 inhabitants, but has no remains of

antiquity. The ancient city probably occupied the

height, now the site of the castle, and the immediate

neighbourhood of the port, which though small,

is secure. Nice is situated at the mouth of the

river Faglume, a considerable mountain torrent,

eridentlv the stream called I\uxo by Plinv and

Mela. (Plin. /. c.; Mel. ii. 4. § 9.)

About 2 miles E. of Nice is a deep bay or inlet

between two rocky promontories, forming a spacious

natural, harbour now known as the (inIf o/ Villa-

Jranca, from a town of that name, which has

however existed only since the 13th century. This

is probably the Poims Olivui.a of the Maritime

Itinerary (p. 504). The Anao Portos of the

same Itinerary is probably a small cove, forming a

well-sheltered harbour for small vessels on the E.

side of the headland, called Copo di S. Ospizio,

which forms the eastern boundary of the (itilf of

ViUaframca, A similar cove a few miles further E.

just below the modern village of F.za. is probably

the Avisio PoKTUI of the same authority; but the

distances given between these [joints are greatly

overstated. [K. H. B.J

Nicaea was destroyed by the Ph/H'tans, and lti iav

habitants founded the Bithynian Nicaea. But erst

if this is true, the town must have been rebuilt seas

afterwards, since we find it in the hands of the A

tolians during the Koinan wars in Giw«. (Po*7

x. 42, xvii. 1 ; Liv. xxviii. 5. xxxii. 32.) Setae-

qnently the town is only mentioned by Strabo (is.

p. 426). Leake identifies Nicaea with the castle

Pundonitza, where there are Hellenic remains,
