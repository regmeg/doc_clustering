anecdote preserved in Athenaens (viii. p. 348) of tlif*

witty musician Stratonieus, who, on coming to

Mvlu-sa. and observing its many temples, but few

inhabitants, placed himself in the middle of tin;

market-place, and exclaimed, '* Hear mi', oh ye

temples." As to tin' history of this city, we know

that Philip of Macedonia, tin* son of Demetrius, en­

deavoured in vain to obtain |>ossession of it; and it

was probably to reward the place for its opposition

to him that tin1 Romans, alter the war with Anti-

uchu*, declared its citizens free (I*«lyb. xvi. '24, xxii.

27; Liv, xxxviii. 39). In a petty war with the

neighbouring Euromian*, the M\Ia-saus were vic­

torious, and took some of their towns; hut were

afterwards compelled to submit to the Ithodians

( Polyb. ,\xx. 5; Liv. xiv. 2.").) In the time of Strabo,

the town appears to liavc been still flom islam', and

two eminent orators, Euthydeinus and Hybrens,

exercised considerable influence over their fellow-

citizens. Hybreas, however, incurred the enmity of

Lnbiemts, bis political adversary, whose pretensions

lie tried to re-ist. But he was obliged to take refuge

in Rhodes; whereupon Lahienus marched with

army against Mylassa, and did great damage to the

town. (Strab.xiv.p.660.) It mentioned,however,

as late as the time of Hieroeles (p. GSS). It is ge­

nerally admitted that the site of the ancient Mylassa

is marked l.y the modem .1/' fttsso or Mthtwi, where

considerable ancient remains have been observed by

travellers. A temple, erected by the people of My­

lassa in honour of Augustus and Roma, considerable

ruins of which bad existed until modern times, was

destroyed about the middle ,.f last centtiry by the

Turks, who built a new moMjne with the materials

(Pococke, Tranh, torn. ii. p. 2. c. f>.) Chandler

(Atrto Mii<->r, ]>. 234) saw leneith the hill, on the

east side of the town, an arch or patcway of marble,

ot the Corinthian order; a broad marble pavement,

with vestiges of a theatre; and round the town ranges

of columns, the remains of porticoes. (' 'omp. Leake,

COIN OT MYLASSA,

MYNDUS (MJi'So?: Fth. MiJp5in5) a Dorian

colony of Troezen, on the coast r>f Caria, situated on

the northernmost of the three Dorian peninsulas, a

few miles to the northwest of Halicarnassus. It was I

protected by strong walls, and had a good harbour.

(Paus. ii. 3*0. § S; St rah. xiv. p. 058; Arrian, A nab. ,

i. 20, ii. 5 ) But otherwise the place is not of J

much importance in ancient history. Both Pliny

(v. 20) and Ntephauus L»y/.. (s. r.) mention Paine- ,

myndus as a place close by Myndus; and this pa-

laemyndus seems to have been the ancient place of

the Carians which became deserted after the esta­

blishment of the Dorian Myndus. (Comp. Strah. xiii.

p. 61 1.) Mela (i. ]('») and Pliny (/. c.) also speak

of a place called Neapolis in the same peninsula; and

as no other authors mention such a place in that

part of the country, it lias been supposed that

Myndus (The Dorian colony) and Neapolis were the |

same place. But it otight to he rt:merri**red tb*l

Pliny mentions both Myndus and Neapolis a* tn

different towns. Myndian ships are n enti'wi ii

the expedition of Anaxagoras against Naxos. (H^-l

v. 33.) At a later time, when Alexander b^i-1;"

Halicarnassns, he was anxious first to make hi"iL<^

master of Myndus; but when he attempted to Ut

it by surprise, the Myndians, with the aid ef rw

foreements from Halicarnassns repulsed him

some loss. (Arrian, /. c.; comp. Hecat. Fnupn. 223
