the Thessalian side of Pindua near the Bourcea of

2. Pklasgiotis (TlfKaayiuTts), inhabited by the

Pelasgiotae (TI(\a<ry:wT(v), extended S. of the Pe­

neius, and along the western side of Pelion and

Ossa, including the district called t lie Pelagic plain.

(Strab. ix. p. 443.) The name shows that this dis­

trict was originally inhabited by iVdasgians; and its

chief town was Lnrissa, a well known name of IV-

lasfjic cities. The towns of Pelasgiotis were:

Elatea, Morsu M, Metropolis, Gyrtos or Gyk-

tmna, Arqura, La kiss a, Sycurium, Ckanxon,

Amyrus, Armknium, Piierae, Cynoscei-iialae,

ScOTl'SSA, PaLAEPHARL'8.

3. Tn essamotis (Wf(r(Ta\iCi»ris), the central

plain nf Thessaly and the upper course of the river

Peneius, so called from its having been first occu­

pied by the Thessalian conquerors from Epeirus.

Its towns were: Pktresiae, Phyllus, Metropolis,

Cierium, Eciiydrium, Pharsalus, the most

important in the district, Thetidicm.

4. Phtih< >tis (4>d(wT(s). inhabited by the Achaean

Phthiotae ('Axaoi $0imtiu), under which name they

are usually mentioned as members of the Amphic-

tyouic league. This district, according to Strabo,

included the southern part of Thcs>aJv, extending

from the Maliac gulf on the E. to Dolopia and

Mount Pindus on the \Y\, and stretching as far N.

as Pharsalus and the Thessalian plains. (.Strab. ix.

p. 430.) Phthiotis derived its name from the Ho­

meric Plithia (*#iTj, //. i. 155, ii. 683), which ap­

peals to have included in the hemic times not only

Hellas ami Dolopia, which is expressly called the

furthest part of Plithia (//. ix. 4S4), but also the

southern portion of the Thessalian plain, since it is

probable that Phthia was also the ancient name of

Pharsalus. (Leake, Northern Greece, vol. iv. p. 484,

Beq.) The cities of Phthiotis were: Amphanaeum

(Scylax, p. 2")), or Amphanae ('A^fpiwai, Steph. Ii.

i.itaea, Coronela, Xyniae, Lamia, Phalara,

Echinus.

5. Magnesia (Mcrynjuici), inhabited by the

Magnetc.s (Md7fT;Tfs), was the long and narrow

blip of country between Mts. Ossa and Pelion on

the W. and the sea on the E., and extending

from the month of the Peneius on the N. to the

Pagasaean gulf on the S. The Magneto were

members of the Ainphictyonic league, and were

settled in this district in the Homeric times. (//.

ii 756.) The Thessalian Magncte* are said to

have founded the Asiatic cities of Magnesia on

Mt. Sipvlus and of Magnesia on the river Marauder.

(Arifltot. ap. Athen, iv. p. 173; Conon, 29; Strab.

xiv. p. G47). The towns of Magnesia were: Ger-
