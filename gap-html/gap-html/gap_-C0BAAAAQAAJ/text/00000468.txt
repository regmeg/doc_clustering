tome i. p. 349); as indeed he maintains, that some

of the maritime towns of the coast of Hcdjat and

Yemen date inure than 400 or 600 years from their

foundation, and that the towns whose walls were

once washed by the waters of the gulf, and which

owed their existence to their vicinity to the sea, have

disappeared since its retirement, with the exception

of those whose soil was sufficiently fertile to maintain

their inhabitants. In a sandy and arid country these

were necessarily few, so that there are not more than

six or seven that can be clearly identified with ancient

sites. Among these Musa still exists under its an­

cient name unchanged (lb. pp. 238, 239. 284) at

the required distance from the Straits of Hnb-tl-

Manddi, via. 300 stadia, reckoning 500 stadia to a

degree, (lb. pp. 2G9, 270.) Vincent makes it

short of 40 miles. {Pwiphis, p. 319.) In the

middle ages when the sea had already retired from

Musa, another town named Mottle or Mauridjw*s

built as a seaport in its stead, which seems to have

usurped the name of the more ancient town, and to

have been mistaken for it by some geographers. This

Mosek still exists, in its turn abandoned by the sea;

but about 25' north of the true position of Musa.

(Ib. p. 270.) "The mart of Yemen at the present

day is Mokha. . . . Twenty miles inland from

Mokha Niebuhr discovered a Moo.ni still existing,

which he with great probability supposes to be the

ancient mart, now carried inland to this distance by

the recession of the coast." (Vincent, /. c. p.315.)

There is a circumstance mentioned by Ilruce of the

roadstead of Mokha, which coincides with a state­

ment cited from Arrian with regard to Muza. Bruce

tays that *' the cables do not rub, because the bottom

is sand, while it is coral in almost every other port.**

(lb. p. 313. n. 142.) Moota itself Niebuhrfound to

l»e 6\ hours = 4^ German miles, due cast of Mokha,

at the commencement of the mountain country, the

intervening space being extremely dry and thinly

peopled. It is an ordinary village, badly built, only

recommended by its water, which is drunk by the

wealthier inhabitants of Mokha. ( I'ogage tii Arabic,

MUZIRIS (Movftpfr, PeripL At. Erythr. o. 54,

p. 297, ap. Gtoyr. Grate Min. ed. Muller,*l855), a

port on the west coast of Hindustan, situated between

Tyndis and Nelcynda. and at the distance of 500

Stadia from either, where, according tc the author of

the Peri pi us, ships came from Ariaca and Greece

(that is. Alexandria). Ptolemy calls it an empo­

rium (vii. 1. § 8), and places it in Limyrica. There

can Ik- little doubt that it is the place which is now-

called Mawjalorc. and which is still a considerable

port. [V.]

MY'CALE (MukciAtj). the westernmost branch of

ML Matogis* in Lydia; it forms a high ridge and

terminates in a promontory called Trogylium, now

cape .S'. Maria. It runs out into the sea just oppo­

site the island of Samoa, from which it is separated

only by a narrow channel seven stadia in breadth. It

was in this channel, and on the mainland at the foot

of Mount Mycale, that the Persians were defeated,

in h. c. 479. It is probable that at the foot of

Mount Mycale there was a town called Mycale or

Mycalleasua, for Stephanas Byx. (*. v.) and Scylax

(p. 37) speak of a town of Mycale in Caria or

Lydia. The whole range of Mount Mycale now

bears the name of Sanunm. (Horn. 77. ii. SG9;

MVCALKSSCS (Mvko\t}(t<t6s: Eth. Myra^ff.

trios), an ancient town of Boeotia, mcntiyued by

Homer. (//. ii. 498, Synm. Apoli. 224.) It wis

said to have been so called, because the cow, vbka

was guiding Cadmus and his comraies to Theba,

lowed (f'1uy'CI/'Ta70) in this place, (Pans. ix. 19.

§ 4.) In B.C. 413, some Thracians, whun 1st

Athenians were sending home to (heir own country,

were landed on the Euripus. and surprised Mycs-

lessns. They not only sacked the town, but put si

the inhabitants to the sword, not sparing sMatf

women and children. Thucydides says thit i

was one of the greatest calamities that had <

befallen any city. (Thuc. vii. 29 ; Tans. i. 23. J 3

Strabo (ix. p. 404) calls Mycalessus a village i

the territory of Tanagra, and places it upoo I

road from Thebes to Chalets. In the time of P

sanias it had ceased to exist; and this writer!

the ruins of Harms and Myc alee sua on his i

Chalcis. (Paus. ix. 19. §4.) Pausanias I

a temple of Demeter Mycalesaia, standing in l

territory of the city upon the sea-coast, and sit

to the right of the Euripus, by which he en"

meant south of the strait. The only other ind

of the position of Mycalessus is the staten

Thucydides {I.e.), that it was 16 stadia j

from the Hermaeum, which was on the ses

near the Euripus. It is evident from these j

that Mycalessus Stood near the Euripus ; and 1

places it, with great probability, upon the

immediately above the southern bay of

where the ruined walls of an ancient city stitt

main. {Northern Greece, vol. ii. pp. 249, l"^

2G4.) It is true, as Leake remarks, that this |

tii in d'K-s lint agree with the statement of Stl

that Mycalessus was on the raid from Thebe

Chains, since the above-mentioned ruins area) I

two miles to the right of that road; but S *

writes loosely of places which he liatl never >

Mycalessus is also mentioned in Strab. lx pp.

410; Paus. iv. 7. s. 12.

MYCE NAE, a town in Crete, the foundaH

which was attributed by an historian of the Attf

age (Veil. Paterc. i. 1) to Agamemnon.

Mycenae for Myuina, which is mentioned as \

of Crete in the text of Pliny {ic.). Siebec ('

vol. ii. p. 280) believed that he had discoTOP /

remains of this city at a place called M

Mast's, on the river Armyro. (Hock, A i - n, /1
