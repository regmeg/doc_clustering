which separated Leucas from the mainland. It is

placed by Leake in t ho plain of Zaverdha, but no

ruins of it have been discovered. Its name docs not

occur in Strabo. Thyrium is first mentioned in

n. c. 373, when its territory was invaded by Iphi-

crates. (Xen. Bell. vi. 2. § 37.) Xenophon de­

scribes it us a place of importance; and it appears

as one of the chief cities of Acarnania at the time

of the Roman wars in Greece, when its name fre­

quently occurs. At this period Thyrium was one

of the places at which the meetings of the Acar-

nanian League were usually held. [Acahnania.]

It was one of the many towns whose ruin was oc-

ca-sioned by the foundation of Nicofolis, to which

it^ inhabitants were removed by order of Augustus.

THYRSUS or TYRSUS (0o><™ mafiAs. PtoL;

&6pao$. Pans.: Tirso), the most considerable river

of Sardinia, which still retains its ancient name al­

most unaltered. It has its sources in the mountains

in the NK. corner of the island, and flows into the

Gulf of Oriitano on the W. coast, after a course of

above 75 miles. About 20 miles from its mouth it

flowed past Forum Trajani, the ruins of which are

still visible at Fordungianus; and about 36 miles

higher up are the Bagi*idi Benetuttt, supposed to

be the Aouae Lesitanae of Ptolemy. The Itineraries

give a station " ad Caput Tyrsi " (It in. Ant. p. 81),

which was 40 M P. from Olbia by a rueged moun­

tain road: it must have been near the village of

Iiudutb. (l>c la Marmora, W-y. m Sardaigne, vol.

ii. p. 445.) Pausanios tells us that in early times

the Thyrsus was the boundary between the part of

the island occupied by the Greeks and Trojans and

that which still remained in the hands of the native

barbarians. (Pans. x. 17. § 6.) [E. H. Ii.]

THYSDRUS (efoSpor, Ptol. iv. 3. § 39), the

oppidum Tusdritanuin or Thysdritanurn of Puny (v.

4. s. 4). a city of Byzacium, in the Roman province

of Africa, lying midway between Thenae and lliaj>-

sus, and west of the promontory Brachodes. It was

ben* that the emperor Gordianus first set up the

standard of rebellion against Maxim in (Herodian.

vii. 4. sen,.; Capitol. Cord. c. 7, seq.), and it was

from him, probably, that it derived its title of a

II. man colony. We find the name variously written,

as Tiisdia, by Hirtius or win-ever was the author of

the history of the African War (B. Afr. 2G, 27, Sec),

and Tusdros, in the ttin. Ant. (p. 59). Now El
