or Bodencus (BrfSVyitot, Pol. ii. 16; Plin. iii. 16.

s. 20), a name said to be derived from its great

depth. It is well known that it was early identified

by the Greeks with the mythical Eridahus, and

was commonly called by them, as well as by the

Latin poets, by that name, even at a late period.

The origin and history of this name have been already

given in the article Eridakus. It may be added,

that the poplar trees which figure in the fable of

Phaeton (in its later form) evidently refer to the tall

and graceful trees, still commonly known as Loni-

bardy poplars, from their growing in abundance on

the banks of the Po. [E. H. B.]

PADUSA. [Padus.]

PADYANDUS (naoVcu/Jos), a town in Cataonia,

or the southernmost part of Cappadocia, about 25

miles to the south-east of Eaustinopolis, near the

pass of Mount Taurus known by the name of the

Cilician Gates. (Htol. v. 7. § 7.) The town, which

was extended by the emperor Valens, is mentioned

in the Itineraries, but its name assumes different

furm8 ; as, Paduandus {Tab. Peat.), Podaudos (/<.

AnL p. 145), Mansio Opodanda (ft. Micros, p. 578),

and Khegepodandos (Hierocl. p 699). The place is

described by Basilias (Epist. 74) as one of the most

wretched holes on earth. It is said to have derived

its name from a small stream in the neighbourhood.

(Const. Porphyr. Vit. Basil. 36 j comp. Cedren. p.

575; Jo. Scylitz. Hut. pp. 829, 844.) The place

is still called /Wend. [L. S.]

PAEA'XIA. [Attica, p. 332, b.]

PAEA'NIUM (ntuaVior), a town in Aetolia,

near the Achelous, a little S. of Ithoria, and N. of

Ocniadae, which was on the other side of the river.

It was only 7 stadia in circumference, and was

destroyed by Philip, B. c. 219. (Polyb. iv. 65.)

Paeanium was perhaps rebuilt, and may be the

same town as Phana (•frdi-u), which was taken by

the Acliaeans, and which we learn from the narrative

in Pausanias was near the sea. (Pans. x. 18.)

Stephanus mentiens Phana as a town of Italy; but

for IloAif 'ItoAIoi, we ought probably to read

rioAtt Airu'Aiuv. (Steph. 1$. s. v. ♦dVou.)

PAELO'NTIUM (nouAdrr.oi-, Plol. ii. 6. § 33),

a town of the Lungones in Asturia, variously identi­

fied with Apfaus, Pula de Lena, and Concejo de

Pilonna. [T. H. D.]

PAEMAXI, mentioned in Caesar (B. G. ii. 4)

with the Coudrusi, Eburones, and Caeroesi, and the

four peoples are included in the name of Gemiani.

DAnville conjectures that they were near the Cou­

drusi, who probably held the country which is now

called Condroz. [Condrusi.] The Paemani may

have occupied the country called Pays de Fam-

menne, of which Durburg, Larvehe on the Ourt/te,

and ltocltefort on the Homme are the chief

towns. [G. L.]

PAEON (noioV, Scyl. p. 28), a town of Thrace,

mentioned only by Scylax. [T. H. I).]

the Argolic colonisation of Emathia, appear to have
