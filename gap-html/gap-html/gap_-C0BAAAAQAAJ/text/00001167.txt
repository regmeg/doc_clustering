TAAXACII (Beya* and Qavadx), a town in

Palestine, not far from Megiddo, with which it is

generally mentioned, was originally one of the royal

cities of the Canaanitcs, (Josh. xii. 21; Jtidges, v.

19; 1 Kings,lv. 12.) It was assigned to Maimssch

(Josh. xvii. 11), but was afterwards one of the

cities given to the Levites. (Josh. xxi. 25.)

"Tannach by the waters of Megiddo" was the

scene of the great battle of Deborah and Barak.

(Judges, v. 19.) In the time uf the Judges the

Canaanitish inhabitants still remained in Taanach

(Judges, i. 27), but in the reign of Solomon it ap­

pears as an Israclitish town. (1 Kings, iv. 12.)

Eusebius describes it as 3 Roman miles, and Jerome

as 4 Roman miles from Legio, which is undoubtedly

the Megiddo of Scripture, [Lkgio.] Taauach U

still called Ta'annmk, a village standing on the slope

of the hills which skirt the plain of Esdraelon to­

wards the south. (Robinson, ISibi Jits. vol. ii. p. 316,

vol. iii. p. 117, 2nd ed.; Stanley, Sinai and I'alts-

tine, p. 331.)

TABAE (Toffoi: Eth. TaSrjvSs), a town which, ac­

cording to Strabo (xii. p. 570),waa situated on the eon-

tines between Phrygia and Caria, and which, in another

passage (p. 576), he evidently includes in Phrygia.

The country was situated in a plain which derived

from the town the name of n*oi'ur TaStjv6v. (Strab.

xii. p. 576.) S:ephanus Byz. (*. r.) on the other

hand calls Tabae a Lydian town, though he at the

same time mentions another in Curia; hut it is highly

probable that not only both are one and the same

town, but also the same as the one assigned by

Strabo to Phrygia, and that in point of fact the town

was in Caria near the confines of Phrygia. Mythi­

cally the name of the place was derived from a hero

Tabus, while others connected it with an Asiatic

term rdSa, which signified a rock. (Steph. It. I. c.)

The latter etymology is not inconsistent with Stralm's

account, for though the town is described an being

in a plain, it. or at least a part of it, may have been

built on a rock. The plain contained beveral other

little towns besides Tabae. Livy (xxxviii. 13). in his

account of the expedition of Maulius, states that he

marched in three days from Gordiutichos to Tabae. It

must then have been a considerable place, for, having

provoked the hostility of the Romans, it was ordered

to pay 20 talents of silver and furnish 10,000

medimni of wheat. Livy remarks that it stood o:i

the borders of Pisidia towards the shore of the

Pamphylian sea. There can be no doubt that

D'Anville i* correct in identifying the modern

Thaous or Davos, a place of some note north-east

of MtHjIfihy with the ancient Tabae. Col. Leake

(A*ia Alinnr, p. 153), relying too implicitly on

Strabo, looks too far east tor its site; fur llierocles
