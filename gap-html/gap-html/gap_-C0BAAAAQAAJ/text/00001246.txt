1160 THERJL THERA.

the reign of Claudius, a.d. 46. This event, with

tile difference of only a simple year, i.s mentioned by

several writers. (Seller. Qtt. Xat. W. 2f>, vi. 21;

Dion Cass. Ix. 29; AureL Vict. Cats. 4, Epit. 4;

Oros. vii. G; Am in. Marc. xvii. 7; Georg. Cedren.

i. p. 1*J7, ed. Par.) Moreover Pliny himself, in

another passage (iv. 12. s. 23), says that Tbia ap­

peared in our age ("in nostru aevo"), which can

hardly apply lo the consulship of Si lan us and Balboa,

since he was not born till a.j>. 2.'i.

In a. i>. 726, during the reign of Leo the [saurian,

Hiera,or the Palaea Kammeni, received an augmenta­

tion i»n the NK. side. (Theoph. Chronogr. \>. 33S,

ed. Paris.; Cedren. i. p. 454, ed. Paris.; Nicephor.

p. 37. ed. Par.) There have lieen several eruptions

in modem times, of which a full account is given by

Lieut. Leyce.ter and Ross. Of these one of the most

important was in 1573, when the Mikra Kammeni

is said to have been formed. But as we have already

seen from several authorities that an island was

formed in the reign of Claudius, a.1>. 46, we must

suppose either that the last-mentioned island sunk

intti the sea at some unknown period, ami made its

appearance a second time as the Mikra Kammeni in

1573. or that there was only an augmentation of

the Mikra Kammeni in this year. The latter sup­

position is the mure probable, especially since Father

liichard, who records it, was not an eye-witness, but

derived his information from old people in the island.

There was another terrible eruption in 1650, which

Father Richard himself saw. It broke out at an

entirely different spot from all preceding eruptions,

outside the gulf, off the NK. coast of Thera, about

<\\ miles from C. Kulumbo, in the direction of Ios

and Anydros. This submarine outbreak lasted about

three months, covering the sea with pumice, and

giving rise to a shoal, winch was found by the

English Survey to have 10 fathoms water over it.

(See map, A.) At the same time the island of

Thera was violently shaken by earthquakes, in which

many houses were overthrown, and a great number

of (H.-rsons and animals were killed by the pestilential

vajHjurs emit Led from the volcano. The sea inundated

the Hat eastern coast of the island to the extent of

two Italian miles inland. The ruins of two ancient

towns at Peri&$a and Kamari were disinterred, the

existence of which was previously unknown, and

which must have been overwhelmed by some pluvious

eruption of volcanic matter. The road also, which

then existed round Cape Mes&a-Yoiuio, was sunk

beneath the witters.

For the next 50 years, or a little longer, the vol­

canic, fires slept, but in 1707 they burst forth with

redoubled fury, and produced the largest of the three

burnt islands, the Aeo Kammeni. It originally con­

sisted of two islands. The first which rose was called

the White Island, composed of a mass of pumice ex­

tremely porous. A few days alter wards there ap-

peared a large chain of dark rocks, composed of

brown trachyte, to which the name of the Black

Island was given. These two islands were gradually

united; atid in the course of the eruptions, the black

rocks became the centre ol the actual island, the

-Vta Kammini. The White Island was first seen  
>i:i the 23rd of May, 1707. and for a year the dis-

rharges of the volcano were incessant. After this

time the eruptions were less frequent; but they con­

tinued to occur at intervals in 1710 and 1711; and

it was not till 1712 that the fires of the volcano

became extinct. The island is now about "1\ miles

ill circuit; and has a perfect cone at its SK. side, 1

\ which is 351 feet high. From 1712 fan lo tie

present day there has been nn further ercpLac.

There are several thenna! and imivrxl c
