THEBAIS. [Tiiebak Akgviti.]

TIIEBE (B^t?7j), a famous ancient town in Mvsia,

at the southern foot of Mount Placius, which is often

mentioned by Homer as governed by Ection, the

father of Andromache (//. i. 366. vi. 397, xiii. 479).

The town is said to have been destroyed during the

Trojan War by Achilles (IL ii. 691; Strab. xiii. pp.

5S4, 585. 612, foil ) It most have been restored

after its first destruction, but it was decayed in the

time of Strabo, and when Pliny (v. 32) wrote it

had entirely disappeared. The l*lief of some of the

ancient grammarians (Etym. M. ». r.; Didym. ad

llom. IL I 336; Diac. ad Ileiiod. Scut. 49; and

Eustath. ad llom. II. ii. 691) that Thebe was only

another name for Adrainyttium, is contradicted by

the most express testimony of the best writers.

Xenophon (A nab. vii. 8. § 7) places it between

Antandrus and Adramyttinm, and Strabo, perhaps

more correctly, between Adramyttium and Carina,

about 80 stadia to the north-east of the former.

(Comp. Pomp. Mela, i. 18; Steph. B. t. v.) Al­

though this town perished at an early period, its name

remained celebrated throughout antiquity, being at­

tached to the neighbouring plain («>;' >;> wtjiof.

Campus Thebanus), which was famed for its fer­

tility, and was often ravaged and plundered by the

different armies, whom the events of war bronght

into this part of Asia. (Herod, vii. 42; Xenoph.

I.e.; Strab. xiii. p. 588; Liv. xxxvii. 19.) Stc-

phanus B. (s. r.) mentions another town of this

name as belonging to the territory of Miletus in

Asia Minor. [L. S.]

but it still bears its ancient name Ttkich. (Kitter,

THEI'SOA (e«<roa: EtK eeiaoeVwi). 1. A town

of Arcadia, in the district Cynuria or Parrhssia, on

the northern slope of Mt. Lycaeus, called after tl»e

nymph Theisoa, one of the nurses of Zeus. Its in­

habitants were removed to Megalopolis upon the

foundation of the latter city. Leake places it at the

castle of St. Iltlm above Lavxiha. Ross discovered

some ancient remains N. of A ndriliiina, which he

conjectures may be those of Theisoa. (Paus. viii.

38. §§ 3, 9, viii. 27. § 4; Steph. B. «. ».; Leake,

2. A town of Arcadia, in the territory of Orcho-

menus, the inhabitants of which also removed to

Megalopolis. It is mentioned along with Methy-

drium and Teulhis as belonging to the confederation

('7( r7*\tia) of Orchomcnos. It is probably repre­

sented by the ruins near Ditnibana. (Pans. viii.
