nomads of Africa (the Septnagint and the Vulgate

understand the Lydians), may be reasonably sup-

posed to belong to the same region. Without the

Towel points, the name will represent the powerful

ami warlike tril>e whom the Greeks call Pharusii.

Tiie similarity of the names seems to have given rise-

to the strange story which Sallust (Ji.J. 18) copied

from the Tunic books, that Hercules had led an

army of Persians into Africa. (" Pharusii quondam

Persae." Plin. v. 8; com p. Pump. Mela, iii. 10, § 3.)

The fierce tribes of Africa thus furnished the Phoe­

nicians with inexhaustible supplies of mercenary

troops, as they afterwards did to Carthage. (Kcn-

rirk, Phoenicia, pp. 135, 277.) [E. B. J.]

PHARY'GIUM (Qapi-yiov), a promontory of

Phocis, with a station for shipping, lying E. of

Anticyra, between Marathus and Myus, now called

Aphid, (Strab. ix. p. 423; Leake, Xorthern Greece,

Palestine built by Herod tlie Great in the Aulon or

Ghor, N. of Jericho, by which means a tract for­

merly desert was rendered fertile and productive.

(Joseph, xvi. 5. § 2, xvii. 11. § 5, xviii. 2. § 2,

B. ./. i. 21. § 9.) The name seems still to have

existed in the middle ages, for Broeardus, qxiotcd by

Jvobinson, speaks of a village named Phasellum,

situated a league N. of J)uk, and corresponding to

tin; position of El-Attjek, where there are ruins.

PHASE'LIS (*I»a(TTj\ij: 4»a(T7)A.(Tij5). a ma­

ritime town of Eyeia, on the Painphylian gulf,

whence some say that it was u town of Painpbylia

(Plin. v. 36; Steph. B. * v.; Dionys. Per. 855;

Stadiam. Mar. May. § 205); but Strabo (xiv. p.

667) distinctly informs us that Phasclis belonged

to Lyeia. and that Olbia was the first Painphylian

town on the coast. The town was a Dorian

colony (Herod, ii. 178), situated on a headland,

and conspicuous to those sailing from Cilicia to

lihodes. (Lit. xxxvii. 23; Cic. in Verr. ii. 4.)

Behind it rose a mountain of the same name, pro­

bably the same which is elsewhere called ret 2<i\t'^a

(Stadias*. Mar. Mag. § 204; Strab. xiv. p. 666);

and in its vicinity there was a lake and a inountain-

pnss leading between Mount Climax and the sea-

coast into Pamphylia. Phaselis had three harbours,

and rose to a high degree of prosjierity, though it

did not belong to the political confederacy of the

other Lycian towns, but formed an independent state

by itself. It is mentioned by Thucydides (ii. 69,

comp. via. 88, 89; Polyb. xsx. 9) as a place of

some importance to the commerce of the Athenians

witli Phoenicia and Cilicia. At a later period, having

become the haunt of the pirates, it w:is attaeked

and taken by Servilius Isauricus. (Cits in Verr.

iv. 10; Eutrop. vi. 3; Vlor. iii. 6.) Although it

was restored after this disaster, yet it never reco­

vered its ancient prosperity; and Lucan (viii. 249.

&C.) describes it as nearly deserted when visited by

Poinpey in his flight from Pbarsalus. According to

Athenaeus (xiv. p. 688) the town was celebrated

for the manufacture of rose-perfume, and Nicunder

{op. A then. p. 683) praised its roses. It was the

common opinion among tlie ancients that the pha­

se! i (<fHiai}\oi), a kind of light sailing boats, were

invented at Phaselis, whence all the coins of the

town show the image of such a boat. Pausanias

(iii. 3. § 6) reports that the spear of Attuta

was exhibited in the temple of Allien* it lk*.

is corrupted into Phasydes; and the Acts of 0»

cils show it to have been toe see 4 a biik'p. ft

may also be remarked that Phasclis was the txok-

place of Theodeetes, a tragic poet and rtn-tcnciai «f

some note. (Steph. B. $. v.; comp. Scvlax. jl 31;

Ptol. v. 3. § 3, 5. § 2; Eckhel, Doct'r. .W S,

p. 6.) There are still considerable remains ol tftej

ancient Phaselis. The lake in its vicinity, i
