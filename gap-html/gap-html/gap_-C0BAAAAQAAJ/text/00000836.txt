ROMA.

The number of slaves kept as domestic servants must

have been exceedingly large. Horace mentinns

(S'it. i. 3. 12) that tlie singer Tigellius had some­

times as ninny as 200 slaves; but when he was

taken with a sudden fit of economy, he reduced

them to the very modest number of 10. No doubt,

however, he was a first-rate vocalist, and, like his

brethren in modern times, a man of fortune. Til-

lius the praetor, who was a stingy churl, when be

went to Tibur, had 5 slaves at Ins heels to carry

his cooking utensils and wine. (fb. i. 6. 107.)

Horace himself, who of course was not so rich a man

as Tigellius, when be sat down to his frugal supper

of cakes and vegetables, was waited upon by 3

slaves; and we may presume that these did not

compose his entire household. {Ib. v. 115.) In

the reign of Nero, 400 slaves were maintained in

the palace of Pedanius Secundus, who were all put

t'i death, women and children included, because one

tit' them had murdered his master. (Tnc. Ann. xiv.

42. seu.) The slaves no longer consisted of those born

and bred on the estates of their masters, but were

imported in multitudes from all the various nations

under the wide-spread dominion of the Romans.

(*' Pustquam vero nationes in familiis habemus,

quibus diversi ritus, externa sacra, aut nulla sunt,

colluviem istam non nisi metu coercueris." {lh. c

44.) The ease of Pedanius, however, was no doubt

an extraordinary one. It cannot be imagined that

the plehs urbana, who received the public rations,

were capable of maintaining slaves; nor probably

are many to be assigned to the aliens. But if we

place the patrician and equestrian families at 15,000,

and allow the moderate average number of 30 slaves

to each family, this would give a total number of

450,000. Some also must l>e allowed to the richer

part of tin* plebt—to persons who, like Horace, were

not patrician nor equestrian, yet could afford to keep

a few slaves; as well as to the aliens resident at

Rome, so that we can hardly compute the number

iif domestic slaves at less than 500,000. To these

must he added the public slaves at the disposal of

the various municipal officers, also those employed

in handicraft trades and manufactures, as journey­

men carpenters, builders, masons, bakers, and the

like. It would not perhaps be too much to estimate

these at 300,000, thus making the total slave popu­

lation of Rome 800,000, This sum, added to that of

the free inhabitants, would give a total of 2,045,1)00.

The Xotitia and Curiosum state the number of

inmlae at Rome at 46,602, and the number of

thimus at 1790, besides balnsa, lupanaria, mili­

tary and police stations, &c. If we had any means

of ascertaining the average number of inhabitants in

each insula, it would afford a valuable mettled of

cheeking the preceding computation. But here

again we are unfortunately reduced to uncertainty

and conjecture. We may, however, pretty surely

infer that each insula contained a large number of

inmates. In the time of Augustus the yearly rent

nf the coenaeula of an insula ordinarily produced

40,000 sesterces, or between 300/. and 400/. sterling.

(ftig. H»- til- 2. s. 30, a p. Gibbon, eh. 31,note 70.)

Petronius (c. 95, 97), and Juvenal (Sat. hi. passim)

describe the crowded state of these lodgings. If we

take them at an average of four stories, each accom­

modating 12 or 13 persons, this would give say 50

persons in each insula; and even then the inmates,men,

women and boys, would be paying an average yearly

rent uf about per head. The inmates of each

domits can hardly be set down at less, since the

family, with tutors and other hangers <*. tmy pe>

haps be fairly estimated at 10, and tlie >]y.r% a

each domus at 40. We learn fruit) YaWua Mu-

imus (iv. 4. § 8), that sixteen men uf tbe mr-

brated Gens Aelia lived in one small Iwlx rti

their families; but this seems to hav* tan a

exceptional cue even in tbe early times, ami rx-s-t

be adopted as a guide under the Empire. Vr

taking the mtuiac actually inhabited at 40,000—

since some must have been to let, or under repi? —

and the inhabited domus at 1500 s41,500,aah»

number of inmates in each at 50. we thoaai aaw

a total population of 2,075,000, a sum not pww

at variance with the amount obtained bj \U y*~

vious method. But the reader will have sea: *

in which they are most calculated to arrest t»

attention of the modern reader, and to fix ixr> «

objects of ancient Rome, and then to the Faroff *t
