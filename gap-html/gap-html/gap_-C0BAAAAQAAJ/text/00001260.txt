afterwards reprinted as " Prolegomena" to the f>U-

sertatio df Thessatonica ejuAque Agro Geogmphica,

Berlin, 1839. With this should be compared his

work on the Via Efjnatia. To these authorities we

outfit to add the introduction to some of the com­

mentaries on St. Paul's Epistles to the Thestalonians,

—especially those of Koch (Berlin 1849) and Ltine-

mann (Gb'ttingen, 1850). [J. S. H.]

THK'STIA. [Thestiexsfa]

THESTIENSES (fc)€ffTie7s, Pol. v. 7), are usually

railed the inhabitants of a town Thestia in Aetolia.

But no town of this name is mentioned by the

ancient writers, and it is not improbable that the

town itself was called e«o"T«ij. The name occurs

only in Poly bins, and the exact site of the place is

unknown. We only learn, from the narrative of

Polybms, that it was situated in the Northern part

of the upper plain of Aetolia. The name is per­

haps connected with Thestius, one of the old Aeto*

lian heroes.

THETI'DIUM (etrlhov, Strab. ix. p. 431;

Polyb. xviii. 3,4; trhTib'ttoy, Etirip. Androm. 20;

BefTTiSeior, Steph. B. *. t'.: Etk. ©cnowi), a place

in Thessaly, close to Pharsalus, where Flamimnna

encamped at the end of the second march from

Pherae towards Scotussa, before the battle of Cyno-

scephalae. It derived its name from Thetis, the

mother of Achilles, the national hero of the Achaean

Phthiotae. Leake places it at or near May'ila, on

the opposite bank of the Enipeus. (Northern

Greece, vol. iv. pp. 472, 473.)

THEUDO'RIA, one of the chief towns of the

Atbamairs in Epeirus, is identified by Leake with

the modern Thodhoriana, a village situated near

Aft writ Tzumerka in a pass which leads from the

Achelous to the Arachthus. (Liv. xxxviii. 1;

Leake. Northern Greece> vol. iv. p. 212.)

THEUMA, a town of Thessaly, near the frontiers

of Dokipia (Liv. xxxii, 13.)

THEUPROSOPON. [Phoenicia, p. 606, a.]

THEVESTE (Seoviarv, Ptol. iv. 3. § 30), an im-

portant town of Numidia, hut which is only mentioned

in the later writers. It was a Roman colony (Grutcr,

fixer, p. 600; ftin. Ant, p. 27), and the place where

many roads running in a SE. direction into the Roman

province of Africa, hail their commencement. (Cf.

Jtin. Ant. pp. 33, 46, 47, 53, 54.) It is the town of

Tebessa, recently discovered by General Negrier, con­

siderable ruins of which still exist, especially the

ancient walls, the circumference of which indicates

a town capable of containing 40,000 inhabitants.

which was separated from Colchis by the river Ophis,

Its name probably should be Sannice, as the Sanni,

or Tzani, were a well-known people in this region.

(Cf. Mannert, iv. p. 378, vi. pt. 2. p. 421; Gail, ad

Annan, p. 95.) [T. H. 1>.]

THIAR, a town of the Contestani in Hi span ia

Tarraconensis, between Carthago Nova, and llici (I tin.

and Orikuela, near which latter place are many ruins.

THIBA (0i'ga: Eth. eiftot), a district in Pontus,
