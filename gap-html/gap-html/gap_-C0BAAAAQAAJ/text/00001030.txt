instance, however, the statement of Strabo is very

specific. It is to the effect that the ambassadors to

Alexander were Kc'Atoi ir*pl rbv 'A5piar(vii. p. 301),

anil that Ptolemy wna the authority. Nevertheless,

Ptolemy may have written TaAdrai, and such

Galatae may have been the Galatae of the Olbian

Inscription. [See infra and SciRi.]

Tlie next Macedonian who crossed the Danube

was lA'simachua, who crossed it only to re-cross it in

his retreat, and who owed his life to the generosity

of a Getic prince Dromichaetes. This was about

B.C. 31*2.

Our next authorities (fragmentary and insufficient)

for the descendants of the Ilerodotean Scythians are

the occupants of the Greek towns of the Eux'ine.

Even those to the south of the Danube, Callatis,

Apollonia, &c, had some Scythians in the neiirh-

hood, sometimes as enemies, sometimes as protec­

tors,—sometimes as protectors against other barba­

rians, sometimes as protectors of Greeks against

Greeks, as was the ease during the Scythian and

Thracian wars (if Ly*imachus. Thechief frontagers,

however, were Getae. Between Olbia, to the north

of the Danube (=01biopolis of Herodotus), and

the native tribes of its neighbourhood, the relations

are illustrated by the inscription already noticed.

(Bbckh, Jtutcr, Grace, no. 2058.) It records a

vote uf public gratitude to Protogenes, and indicates

the troubles in which he helped Ins fellow-citizens.

The chief of those arose from the pressure of the

barbarians around, by name Saudaratae, Thi>ametae,

Sciri [see Sciri], Galatae, and Scythae. The date

of tins inscription is uncertain; but we may see the

import, of the observations on the word Galatae

when we find the assumption that they were Gauls

of Gallia used as an instrument of criticism:—-" The

date of the above inscription is not specified; the

terror inspired by the Gauls, even to other barba­

rians, seems to suit the second century b. c. better

than it suits a later period." (Grote, Uiit. of

Greece, vol. sii. p. 644, note.) What, however, if

the Galatae of WcUlnchia were as little Galli as the

t 'ermaiiians of Persia are Germans, or as Galacz is

the. same as Calais? The present writer wholly dis­

connects them, and ignores the whole system of

hypothetical migrations by which the identity is

supported.

A second Olbia in respect to its Helleno-Scythic

relations, was Bosporus, or Panticapaeum, a Greek

settlement which lasted from B.C. 480 till the reign

of Mithridates. [Panticapaeum.]

From Bosporus there was a great trade with

Alliens in corn, hides, arid Scythian slaves,—Scythes,

as the name of a slave, occurring as early as the

time of Thcoguis, and earlier in the Athenian

drama than those of Davus and Geta (Dacian and

Getic) which belong to the New Comedy,—Scythes

and Scythaena being found in the Old.

The political relations were those of independent

municipalities; sometimes (sovereign, sometimes pro­

tected. The archons of Bosporus paid tribute to

the Scythian princes of their neiglitwurhood, when

they were powerful and united; took it, when the

Scythians were weak and disunited. Under this

latter category came the details of the division of

t;ie Maeotae, viz., Sindi, Toraeti, Dandarii, Thetes,

&e. Of these, Parysades I. (a Scythic rather than

a Greek name) was king, being only arc/ton of his

native, town. Jn the civil wars, too, of Bourns, the

Scythians took a part; nor were there wanting ex­

amples uf Scythian n aimers even in the case of the

Panticapaean potentates. Eumelos tort, bis Uf* if
