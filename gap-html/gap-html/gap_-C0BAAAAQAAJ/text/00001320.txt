1236 TROGILIUM.

TEOGLODYTAE

Calaureia, named Pogon, where the Grecian fleet was

ordered to assemble before tlie battle of Salamis

(Herod* viii. 42; Strab. viii. p. 373.) The port-

town, which was named Celenderis (Pans. ii. 32.

§ '.)). appears to have stood at tlie western extremity

of the bay of Pogon, where some ancient remains are

found. Tlie high roc ky peninsula of Met liana,

which belonged to the territory of Troezen and is

united to the mainland by a narrow isthmus, is

described in a separate article. [Methana.] There

were formerly two islands ofl* the coast of Troezen,

named Calaureia and Sphaeria (afterwards Iliera),

which are now united by a narrow sandbank.

(Leake. Mwea, vol. ii. p. 442, seq.; Boblaye, Re-

cherclies, #c. p. 56; Curtius, Peloponnetos, vol. ii.

p. 431, seq.)

TROGI'LIUM (Tfwy't\iov), a promontory formed

by the western termination of Mount Mjrcale, op-

pottitc the island of Samos, Close to this pro­

montory there was an island bearing the same name.

(Strab. xiv. p. 636; Steph. R. s. v. TpuryiKos, ac­

cording to whom it was also called Trogilia; Act.

A post, xx. 15, where its name is Trogyllion.) Pliny

(v. 31.s. 37) speaks of three islands being called Tro-

giliae, their separate names being Pbilion, Argennon,

and Sandalion. [L. S.]

TROGI'LIUM, a town of Lu&itania, according to

Luitprand (Adversaria, § 3D, ap. Wessel. ad I tin.

p. 43$), the same place which Pliny (iv. 35) calls

Custra Julia. It is incontestably the T ureal ion of

the Geogr. Kav. (iv. 35) and the modern Truxillo.

(Cf. Florez, Esp. Sugr. xiii. p. 114, and Ukert, ii.

pt. i.p. 395.) [T.H.D.]

TliOGI'TIS (TpuryiTis), a small like in Ly-

caonia, mentioned only by Strabo (xii. p. 5G8),

and probably the same as the one now called

JIghun. [L. S.]

X<*>pa, Diodor. i. 30; Ptol. iv. 7, 27.) Under tlie

term Tro;rlodytae the ancienrs appear to have in­

cluded various races of men. For we meet with them

in Muuretania (Strab. xvii. p. 828) ; in tlie interior of

Libya east of the Garamantes, along the Arabian

shore of the lied Sea, as well as on the opposite coast

of Aethiopia and Aei;ypt, and on both in such

numbers that the districts were each of them named

"Regio Troglodytica;" and even on the northern

side of the Caucasus (Strab, xi. p. 506). The

Caucasian Troglodytae were in a higher state of

civilisation than their eastern namesakes, since they

cultivated corn.

Hut the race most commonly known as Troglo­

dytae inhabited either shore of the lied Sea, and

were probably a mixture of Arabian and Aethiopian

blood. '1 heir name, as its composition imports

(rpjjy\-n. Sea?), was assigned to them because they

either dug for themselves cabins in the lime and

sandstone hills of that region, or availed tliem-

selves of its natural caverns. Even in the latter

case, the tillages of the Troglodytae were partly

formed by art, since long tunnels, for the pas­

sage or stabling of their herds, were cut between

village and village, and the rocks were honey­

combed by tiieir dwellings. Rruce saw at Gojam

in Nubia a series of Mich caverns, inhabited by

herdsmen, and witnessed the periodical passage of

the cattle in Sennaar from the lowlands to the

hills. The same cause led to similar migrations in |

ancient times, vii^ the api-earaiwrf fstpfrl

Airatharchides of Cnido* is the nr-ci fit

who mentions the Troclociytae (<tp.Pwnm.i4k

p. 786) animal food was their sUpk art;

eat not only the flesh but aUo tbe bow* tii

of their cattle. Their drink ww i nuitart

and blood. Since, however, ohIt tl»e cker-c^ "-

beasts were slaughtered for tuod, it may »ir»-3i

that the better animals were resentc w ■

Aegyptian and Aethiopian markets. Tn* i«
