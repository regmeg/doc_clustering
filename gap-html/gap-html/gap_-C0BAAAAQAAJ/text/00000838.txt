divinity as Dens Fidiui (Fest. p. 241, Miill.), whose

saecllum is mentioned by Livy (viii. 20) as. situated

near the temple of Quirinus. It is also recorded in

the fragments of the Argive Iwoks as seated on the

Colli* Mucialis (Varr. /,./.. v.§ 62, MuTl.),which hill

comes next in order after the Collis Salutaris. We

have already mentioned the temple of Quirinus as

having been situated near the present church of

S. Andrea and it may therefore be assumed that the

Porta Sanqualis spanned the ascent to it at or near

the modern Via d#Un Dataria.

Between the PortaSanqualis and theCapitolinehill

there were probably two gates : at all events there

must undoubtedly have been one in the very narrow

ravine which in early times separated the Capitoline

from the Quirinal, and which a Horded the only

outlet from the neighbourhood of the forum. This

was, perhaps, the Porta Ratumena, which we

learn from Pliny (viii.65: "undo postea nomen esV)

and Plutarch (Popl. 13: wapa tV ttvKyv, vvv

'Varovfxivav koXovitiv) was still existing in their time.

Becker, indeed, disputes the inference of its existence

from Pliny's words,and disbelieves the assertion of Plu­

tarch. But there is nothing at all incredible in the fact,

and therefore no reason why we should disbelieve it.

We know, from the* example of London and other cities,

that a gate, and especially the name of agate marking

its former site, may remain for ages after the wall

in which it stood has been removed. Even the local

tradition of its name would have sufficed to mark its

site; but it seems highly probable, from the nature

of the ground where it stood, that the gate itself had

been preserved. The road through so narrow a gorge

could never have been disturbed for building or other

purjioses; and it is probable that the gate remained

.standing till the ravine was enlarged by cutting away

the Quirinal in order to make room for Trajan's

torn in. We learn from the passages just cited, us

well as from Fest us (p. 274"), that the gate derived

its name from a charioteer, who, returning victorious

from the Circen>ian games at Veii, was thrown out

of his chariot and killed at this spot, whilst t'-ie

affrighted horses, thus freed from all control, dashed

up the Capitoline hill, and, as the legend runs, did not

finish their mad career till they bad thrice made the

circuit of the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus. (Plin.

viii. 65.) So remarkable an omen would have been

quite a sufficient ground in those days for changing

the name of the gate. But it matters little what

faith we may be disposed to place in the legend; for
