fa lustorians of Alexander's march leave us to

p*# that Sogdiana abounded with large towns;

many of these, as Professor Wilson has re­

ts! (I. c), were probably little more than forts

ted along the lines of the great rivers to defend

country from the incursions of the barbarous

'U (2oAm: Eth. 2oA«vr or 2<fAioj), an im­

portant town on the coast of Cilicia, between the

mouths of (he rivers Lam us and Pyramos, from each

of which its distance was about 500 stadia. (Strab.

xiv. p. 675; Stadiasm. Mar. Mag. § 170, &c.)

The town was founded by Argives joined by Lin-

dians from Rhodes. (Strab. xiv. p. 671; Pomp.

Mela, i. 13; Liv. xxxvii. 56.) It is first mentioned

in history by Xenoplmn (Anab. i. 2. § 24) as a

maritime town of Cilicia; it rose to such opu­

lence that Alexander the Great could fine its citizens

for their attachment to Persia with 200 talents.

(Arrian, Annb. ii. 5. § 5; Curt. iii. 17.) During the

Mithridatic War the town of Soli was taken and de­

stroyed by Tigranes, king of Armenia, who probably

transplanted most of its inhabitants to Tigranocerta.

(Dion Cass, xxxvi. 20; Plut. fW 28; Strab. xi.

p. 532 ) But the place was revived by Pompey, who

peopled it with some of those pirates who had fallen

into his hands, and changed its name into Pom-

pciupolis. (T\ofxirT}iouwoKtf, Plut. /. c; Strab. xiv.

p. 671; Appian. Mithr. 105; Ptol. v. 8. § 4; Plin.

v. 22; Steph. B. a. r.; Tac. Arm. ii. 58; Hierocl.

p. 704.) Soli was the birthplace of Chryaippus

the philosopher, and of two distinguished poets,

Philemon and A rat us, the latter of whom was

believed to be buried on a hill near the town. The

Greek inhabitants of Soli are reported to have spoken

a very corrupt Greek in consequence of their inter­

course with the natives of Cilicia, and hence to have

given rise to the term solecism (ffoAoiiaffftoj). which

has found its way into all the languages of Europe;

other traditions, however, connect the origin of this

term with the town of Soli, in Cyprus. (Diog. Laert.

i. 2. § 4; Eustath. ad Dion. Per. 875; Suid. a. v.

16\oi.) The locality and the remains of this ancient

city have been described by Beaufort (Karamania,

p. 261, foil.). "The first object that presented

itself to us on landing," says he, " was a beautiful

harbour or basin, with parallel sides and circular

ends; it is entirely artificial, being formed with sur-

rounding walls or moles, which are 50 feet in thick­

ness and 7 in height. Opposite to the entrance uf

tlie harbour a portico rises from the surrounding

quay, and opens to a double row of 200 columns,

which, crossing the town, communicates with the

principal gate towards the country. Of the 200

columns no more than 42 are now standing; the

remainder lie on the spot where they fell, intermixed

with a vast assemblage of other ruined buildings

which were connected with the colonnade. The

theatre is almost entirely destroyed. The city

walls, strengthened by numerous towers, entirely

surrounded the town. Detached ruins, tombs, and

from tlie walls, on the outside of the town, and it is

evident that the whole country was once occuyn*ed

by a numerous and industrious (■•ople." The natives

now call tlie place Mezettu. (Comp. Leake, Ana

Minor, p. 213, ML) The little river which passed

thruugh Soli was called Li par is, from the oily nature
