882 SALERXUM. SALENTINI.

had as early as tins pushed their arms into the

lapygian peninsula, and it is probable that the

Salentines are here confounded with the Peucetians,

with whom, according tu .some accounts, they were

clo»e]y connected. (Plin. iii. 11. 8. 1G.) Hut the

name is used with still greater laxity shortly after,

when Livy speaks of Thuriae ;ls " Qrbem in Sallen-

tii.is " (x. 2), if at least, as there seems little doubt,

the place there meant is the well-known city of

Thurii in Lucania [Titmin].

The name of the Sallentines does not again oomr

in history till the Fourth Samnite War, when they

joined the confederacy formed by the Samnitcs and

Tarentines against Home; and shared in their defeat

by the consul L. Aemilius Barbula in b. c. 281. a?,

we find that general celebrating a triumph over the

Tarentines, Sammtes, and Sallentines. (Fast. Capit.

ann. 47.'i.) For some time after this the appear­

ance of Pyrrkus in Italy drew off the attention of

the 1 tomans from more ignoble adversaries, but when

that monarch had finally withdrawn from Italy, and

Tarentum itself had fallen into the hands of the

Romans, they were left at leisure to turn their

arms against the few tribes that still maintained

their independence. In n. c. 207 war was declared

against the Salentines, and both consuls were em­

ployed in their subjugation. It way not likely that

they could oiler much resistance, yet their final

conquest was not completed till the following year,

when both consuls aL'ain celebrated triumphs '* dc

Messapits Salientiuisque." (Fast. Capit; Zonar. viii.

7; Liv. F.pit. xv; Florus, i. 20; Eutrop. ii. 17.)

All the Roman writers on this occasion mention the

Salentines alone; the Triumphal Fasti, however, re­

cord the name of the Messapians in conjunction with

them, and it is certain that both nations were

included both in the war and the conquest, for

Brnndusium, which is called by Florus "caput

regionis," and the occupation of which was evidently

the main object of the war (Zonar. /. c), seems to

have been at that period certainly a Messapian city.

The Salentines are again mentioned as revolting to

Hannibal during the Second Punic War (B.C. 213),

but seem to have been again reduced to subjection

without difficulty. (Liv. xxv. 1, xxvii. 41.)

From this lime their name disappears from history,

and is not even found among the nations of Italy

that took up anus in the Social War. But the

"Sallentinus ager" continued to be a recognised

term, and the people are spoken of both by Pliny and

Slraho as distinct from their neighbour* theCalabri.

(Stnib. vi. p. 277; Plin. iii. 11. s. 16; Ptol. iii. 1. §

13; Mel. ii. 4; Cic. pro Hose. Am. 46.) The

"regio Salentina" is even mentioned a.s a distinct

portion of Calabria as late as the time of the Lom­

bards. (P. Diac. But. Lang. ii. 21.)

The physical character and topography of the

country of the Salentines arc given in the article

Calabiua. The following towns arc assigned by

Pliny to tlie Salentines, as distinguished from the

Calabrians, strictly so called: Alktium, Barta,

Nekktum, Uxextum, and Vkbktum. All these

are situated in the extreme southern end of the

lapygian peninsula. The list given by Ptolemy

nearly agrees with that of Plinv; but he adds

Khndiae, which was considerably further X., and is

reckoned on good authority a Calabrian city [Rhu-

DIAe]. The place he calls Banota is probably the

Bast a of Pliny. To these inland towns may proba­

bly be added the seaports of Calljpolis, Castbum

JIi.NEitVAi:, and perhaps Hydkintim also, though

the hist seems to have early Rcnvd % Cti»»fc

colony. But it is probable that at an earii#T pr. 4

the territory of the Salentines was m^.t- ■

more extensive. Stephanus of Byzantium spnb 4

a city of the name of Sailentia, from ■iuch

derived the name of the Salientines, ba: ittzxL'-**

of this is found in any other writer, and it is (Sta­

bly a mere mistake. [L. H. Y>]
