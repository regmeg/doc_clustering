S1MYLLA (SipvAAa, Ptol. Tii. 1. § 6), a com­

mercial entrepot on the western coast of liindostan,

in the district called 'Aptana SaSiWftV. It is noticed

in the Peri pi Ql by the name of StjjUt/AAa, and was

probably at or near Basstin, a little X. of Bom-

SI'MYHA (Si^ifpa). a maritime city nf Phoenicia

mentioned by Pliny in connection with Marathus

and Antaradus, N. of Tripolis, Orthosis, and the

river Kleutherus (v. 20). It is placed by Ptolemy

between the mouth of the Kleutherus and Orthosia,

and, if the figures can be trusted, 10* west of the

former, 14' north; in the same latitude with Or­

thosia (i. e. 34° 40'), but 40' east of it, which

would seem either to imply an ignorance of the

coast, or to intimate that Simyra lay at some dis­

tance fr<>m the shore, and that the Eleatherus ran

southward to the sea. Strsbo says that it was oc­

cupied hy the Aradians, to ether with the neigh­

bouring Marathus (xvi. p. 753), apparently placing

it north of the Elrutherus. In addition to what has

been said under Ma RATH US, and in confirmation of

the identification there attempted, the following may

be cited from Shaw, and will serve to illustrate the

situation of Simyra: " The ancient Marathus may

he fixed at some nuns near the Serpent Fmtntain,

which make, with tiou-tcaddr and Tortosa, almost

an equilateral triangle. About 5 miles from the

river Akkert and 24 to the SSE of Tortosa, there

are other considerable ruins known by the name of

iynmrakt with several rich plantations of mulberry

and other fruit trees growing in and round about

them. These, from the very name and situation,

can be no other than the remains of the ancient

Simyra . .. the seat formerly of the Zemarites. Pliny

v. 20) makes Simyra a city of Coelesyria. and ac­

quaints us that Mount Libanus ended there to the

northward; but as Sttmrah lies in the Jeune (i.e.

the great plain), 2 leagues distant from that

mountain, this circumstance will better fall in with

Area, where Mount Libanus is remarkablv broken

off and discontinued." {Travels, pp. 2G8, 269.) The

ruins of Area are 5 miles E. of Sumrah, and 2 leagues

WSW. of Area is the Sakr-el-Berd, the Cold

Hirer, which Shaw and others identity with the Kleu­

therus. It is manifest how irreconcilable all this

is with Ptolemy and other ancient geographers.
