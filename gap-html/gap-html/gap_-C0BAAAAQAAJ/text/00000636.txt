moderate elevation, situated between Parnassus and

Mount Hedylium; hi' adds that these two moun­

tains were separated from each other by an interval

nf 5 stadia, through which the Cephissus flowed.

(Stiab. ix. p. 424.) Parapotamii was destroyed by

Xerxes (Herod, vui. 33), and again a second time

hy Philip at the conclusion of the Sacred War.

(Tans. x. 3. § 1.) It was never rebuilt. Plutarch

in his lite of Sulla (c. 16) speaks of the acropolis of

t'ne deserted city, which he describes as a stony

height surrounded with a precipice and separated

from Mi. Hedylium only by the river Assus.

PARAVAEI (riopouaici, Time. ii. 81); Rhianus,

ap. Steph. B. s. t\),an Epirut tribe, whose territories,

conterminous with those of the Orestae, were situated

..ii the banks of the Aous (Viosa), from which they

took their name. In the third year of ihe Peloponne-

sian War. a body of them, under tlteir chief Oroedus,

ti> Pelinnaeum in Thessuly, which stood a little to

ihe E. of Trikkala, remarks that Alexander passed by

the highlands of Paravaea,— Ldzari and Smdlika,

with the adjacent mountains.

Tlie seat of this tribe must be confined to the

valleys of the main or E. branch of the Aous, and

the mountains in which that river originates, ex­

tending from the Aoi Stena or KlUura, as far S. as

the binders of Tymphaea and the Molossi, and

including the central and fertile district of Kt/nitzOy

with the X. part of Zagori. (Leake, Nor Own

PARE'MBOLE ( ri ap e ,u So a tj, Melet. Brev. p.

IRS; Pammbole, //. Ant. p. 101; It. Ilieros. p.

568) was a port or castle (Castra, Plin. v. 9. s. 10)

on the borders of Aegypt and Aethiopia, and alter­

nately attached to either kingdom. Parembole was

situated between Syenc and Taphis, on tlie left bank

of the Nile, lat. 23° 40' N. In Roman times it was

nut' <if the principal fortresses of the southern ex­

tremity of tlie empire, and was usually occupied by

u legion. On the recession of the Roman boundary

in Diocletian's reign, Parembole was handed over to

the Nubae, and was frequently assailed by the

Itlemmyes from the opposite bank of the river.

(1'rocop. B. Pers. i. 19.) The ruins of its temples

may still be seen at the village of Ihbot or Debou.

From the square enclosure of brick found there it

would seem to have ken a penal settlement for

criminals as well as a regular station for soldiers.

(Rosellin. Man. del Culto, p. 189.) [W. B. D.]

PARE'NTIUM (Wapivnov; Parenzo}, a city of

stria, on the W. coast of the peninsida, about

30 miles N. of Pola. (Plin. iii. 19. s. 23; Ptol. iii.

I. § 27; Itin. Ant. p. 271; Tab. Pent.-. Anon. Rav.

iv. 31.) From the mention of the name by Ste-

phanus of Byzantium («. r.) it is probable that it

existed as an Istriau town previous to the Roman

settlement there. Pliny calls it an " oppidum civinm

Romarmrutn," anil it would seem that it was already

one of the most considerable town-, in the province,

though it did not then enjoy the rank of a colony.

But we learn from inscriptions that it subsequently

attained this rank under Trajan, and bore the

titles of Colonia Ulpia Parentiurn (Orcll. Inner.

72. 3729; Zumpt, dt (.'ohm. p. 402.) In common

with the other cities of Istna, its most flourishing

period belongs to the close of the Western E'nfin.

The modern city of Partnzo is a small place, tot

retains its episcopal see, which dates fwiw

early period. [K. H - Bj
