1220 TRAXSDUCTA. TRAJECTUM.

for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge Trnjanopolis

is placed on the Egnatiau Way at a considerable dis­

tance \V. of the Hebrus, and at a point which fulfils

tolerably well the conditions of distance from the

two places above mentioned.

Trajanopolis became the capital of the province of

Rhodopc, and continued to be a place of importance

until the fourth century. It is remarkable, how­

ever, that it is not mentioned by Ainmiauus in his

general description of Thrace (xxvii. 4); according

to him, the chief cities of Rhodopewere Maximiano-

polis, Maroneia, and Aenus. (Ptol. iii. 11. §13;

Hierocl. p. 631: Procop. de Aed. W. 11 : Const.

Porph. de Caerim. ii. 5-4: Cantacuz. i. 38, iii. 67,

et alibi; ft. Ant. pp. 175, 322, 332, 333; ft.

I UAJECTUM, in North Gallia, is not mentioned

in any Roman writing before the Itin. of Antoninus.

It was on the Roman road which ran along the

Rhine from Lugdunum Batavorum, and the site is

Utrecht in the kingdom of the Netherlands, at the

bifurcation of the old Rhine and the VechL The mo­

dern name contains the Roman name abbreviated,

and the part U seems to he a corruption of the word

Oude (Vetus); but D'Anvillc observes that the name

is written Utrecht as early as 870. [G. L.]

TRAJECTUS in Gallia, placed by the Antonine,

Itin. on a road which runs from Aginnom {Agen)

through Excisum and Trajectus to Vesunna {Peri-

gnntx). Trajectus is xxi. from Excisum {Ville

AVure), and xviii. from Vesunna, and it marks the

passage of the Duranioa (Dordogne) between these

two positions at a place called rontons on tlie Dor-

dogne, opposite to which on tlie other bank of the

riwr is La Linde, mentioned in the Table under the

name of iJiolindum. [Dioundum.] L.]

TRAIS. [Trakss.]

TRALLES or TRALLIS (TpctAAeis, TpdAAir:

Eth. Tpa.Wia.v6s), a large and nourishing city of

Caria, on the southern slope of mount Messogis, a

little to tlie north of the Scamander, a small tribu­

tary of which, the Eudon, flowed close by tlie city,

while another passed right through it. Its acropolis

i\as situated una lofty eminence in the north of the

city. Tralles was said to have been founded by Ar-

gives in conjunction with a body of Thraeians, whence

its name Tralles was believed to he derived (Strab.

xiv. pp. 648, 649; Hesych, s. p.; Diod. Sic. xvii. 65;

Plut. Age*. 16). for it is said to have previously been

called Anthea, Eranthea, Erymna, Charax, Seleucia,

and Antiochia (Steph. 15. 5. pp. TpoAAii, Xdpa£;

Etym. SI. p. 381*; Plin. r. 29). Others, however,

st:ite that it was a Pelasgian colony, and originally

bora the name of Larissa (Agath. ii. 17; Schol. ad

Horn. II. x. 42'J). It was situated in a most fertile

district, at a point where highroads met from the

south, east, and west; so that it must have been a

place of considerable commerce. (Cic. ad Alt. v.

14, ad Fam. iii. 5, ad Quint. Frat. i. 1; Strab. xiv.

p. 663.) The inhabitants of Tralles were celebrated

for their great wealth, and were generally appointed

asiarchs, that is, presidents of the games celebrated

in the district. But the country in which Tralles

was situated was much subject to earthquakes;

in the reign of Augustus many of its public build­

ings were greatly damaged by a violent shock; and

the emperor gave the inhabitants a handsome sum

of money to repair the losses they had sustained.

(Strab. xii. p. 579.) Out of gratitude, the Trallians

petitioned to be permitted to erect a temple in honour

of Tiberius, bnt without efT<>ct. (Tit .ha tr. Si)
