TAURANTTIUM. a district of Armenia Major

TATRA'SIA (Taurari), an ancient city of Sam-

m, in the country of the Hirpini Kit tinted on the

It bank of the river Calor, about 16 miles above

; ndi-n with the Tamarua. The name of the

tt known only from the inscription on the tomb

I. vip.> Barbatus, which records it among the

n of Samnium taken by him during the Third

mite War. (OrelL lnser. 550.) It was probably

■■n fiv assanlt, and suffered severely, for no suh-

arnt mention of the town ocenrs in history : but

territory ("ager, qui Taurasinorum fuerat"),

rh was doubtless confiscated at the same time, is

rtwoed l«f afterwards-, as a part of the "ager

fj-oi populi Romani," on which the Apuan Li-

jr.i who had U-en removed from their own

l«j were established by order of the senate.

Jl. 38.) These Ligiirians appear to have

filled in the plain on the banks of the Ta­

li near its junction with the Cnlor; but there

be little doubt that the modern village of Tau-

, though 16 miles further S., retains the name,

marks (approximately at least) the site of the

f« Tanr&sia.

rreral modem writers identify these Taurasini

ifi with the Armani Cam pi near Brneventum,

ii were the scene of the defeat of Pyrrlius by M\

a« Drutatus (Klor. i. 18; Oms. iv. 2), and the

ntion is probable enough, though unsupported

irsuthoritv. [Bewkvkxtum.] [K. H. B.J

fctRI (Tavpot, Strab. vii. p. 308), the inhabitants

w Cbersonesos Tauriea, or modern Crimea.

*'re probably the remains of the Cimmerians,  
wtr? driven out of the Chersonese by the Scy-

a (Herod, iv. II, 12; Heeren, Idcen, i. 2.

1: Mannert, ir. p. 278.) They seem to have

u'Wtdcd into several tribes: but the two main

'« of* them were the nomad Tauri and the

utnral. (Strab. vii. p. 311.) The former

Vricultural Tauri were somewhat more civil-

i*: altfvethrr they were a rude and savage

1 delighting in war and plunder, and jKirti-

y addicted to piracy. (Herod, iv. 103; Strab.

3US; Mela,u. 1 ; Tac. Ann. xii. 17.) Ncver-

. :n eariv times at least, they appear to have

tmitad under a monarchical government

d. iv. 119). Their religion waa particularly

y aid horrible, consisting of human sacrifices

nrgio goddeas, who, according to Ammianua

'>Unua (xxii. 8. a. 34), was named Oreiloche,

b the Greeks regarded her as identical with

Artraiis, and called her Tauropolos. (Soph.

72; Eur. Ipk. Taw. 1457; I>iod. iv. 44;

Tat. viii. 2; Strab. xiiL 535; BbVkh. ftiscr.

These victims consisted of shipwrecked

K or Greeks that fell into their bands. After

: than, they stack their heads upon poles, or,

according to Amnuanus (/. c), affixed them to the

wall of the temple, whilst they oast down the bodies

from the rook on which the temple stood. (Herod,

iv. 103; Ov. ex Pont. iii. 2. 45, acq., Trist. iv. 4.

63.) According to a tradition among the Tauri

themselves, this goddess was Iphtgenia, the daughter

of Agamemnon (Herod. /. r.) They had also a cus­

tom of cutting off the heads of prisoners of war, and

setting them on poles above the chimneys of their

houses, which usage they regarded as a protection

of their dwellings {lb). If the king died, all

his dearest friends were buried with him. On the

decease of a friend of the king's, he either cut

off the whole or part of the deceased person's ear,

according to his dignitv. (Nic. Damase. p. 160,

Orell.) [T. H. D-]

TAURIA'NUM (7rartW>), a town on the W.

const of Bruttium, near the mouth of the river Me-

taurus (Marro). Its name is mentioned by Mela,

who places it between Scylla and Metaunim. It

was probably, therefore, situated to the S. of the

river, while the town of Metaunim was on its N.

bank. Subsequently all trace of the latter disap­

pears; but the name of Tauriana is still found in

the Tabula, which places it 23 miles S. of Vibo

Valentia. (Mel. ii. 4. § 8; Tab. Pent.) It became

the see of a bishop in the later ages of the Koman

empire, and retained that dignity down to the time

of Gregory VII., when the town had fallen into

complete decay. Its ruins, however, still exist, and

the site is said to retain the name of Trariano.

(Hoisten. Not. ad Cluver. p. 299; Komanelli, vol. L

p. 70.)

There can be no doubt that the "Tauroertum

oppidmn" of Pliny (iii. 5. s. 10), which he mentions

immediately after the " Metaurus amnis," is the same

pla.e that is called by Mela Taurianum. [K. H. B.]

TAU'RICA CHERSONE'SUS (y Tavptxh X*p-

ffSrnoos, Piol. iii. Arg. 2, &c), a peninsula stretch­

ing into the Pontus Kuxinu* from Sarmatia, or the

country of the nomad Scythians, with which it is

connected by a narrow isthmus, anciently called

Taphrus, or Taphrae, now the isthmus of Perecop

The peninsula also bore the name of Chrraonesus

Scythica. and whs sometimes styled simply Tauriea,

(Ph'n. iv. 12. s. 26; Scylax, i. *p. 29, Hilda.) It w

now called the Crimea, from the once famous city of

Kuki-Krim; but since its incorporation with the

Ku>Man empire, the name of Ttturica has also been

again applied to it.

The isthmus which connects the peninsula with

Sarmatia is so slender, being in some parts scarcely

40 stadia or 5 miles across (Strab. vii. p. 308;

Clarke, Trar. ii. p. 314, 4th ed. 1816), as to

make it probable that in a very remote period

Tauriea was an island. (Plin. /. c.; cf. Pallas,

Voyages, &c, ii. p. 2, Yr. Transl. 4to.) The

ancients compared it with the Peloponnesus, * ith ai

to size and stupe (Strab. vii. p. 310; cf. Herod, iv.

99); and this comparison is sufficiently happy, ex-

cept that Tauriea throws out another smaller penin­

sula on its K. side, the Bosporan j«eninsula, or penin­

sula ot" KrrUch, which helps to form the S. boundary,

or const, of the Palus Maeotis. The Chersonese is

about 200 miles across in a direct line from Cape

Tatrhan, its extreme W. point, to the Straits of

KerUch, and 125 miles from N. to S., from Perecop

to Cape Kikineu. It contains an area of about

10.050 sqnare miles. Nearly three-fourths of

Tanrica consist of tint plains little elevated above

the sea; the remainder towards the S. is mouu­
