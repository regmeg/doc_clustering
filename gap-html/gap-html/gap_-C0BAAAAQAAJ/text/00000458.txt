MO'PSIUM (MfJ^tov: Eth. Mtyto*, Steph. IS.,

Mo^rcievr, a dialectic form of Moif*«os), a town of

Pelasgiotia in Tbessaly, situated upon a hill of the

same name, which, according to Livy, was situated

midway between Larissa and Teinpe. Its ruins are

still conspicuous in the situation mentioned by Livy,

near the northern end of the lake Karatjair or

Nessonis. (Steph. li. v.; Strab. ix. pp. 441, 443;

Liv. xlii. 61, G7; Leake, Northern Gnur, vol. iii.

MOPSO'PIA (Mu^oiri'a). an ancient name of

Attica, derived from the hero MopaopUS or MopsopS.

(Strab. iv. p. 397; Lycophr. 1339; Stej.li. B. s.r.)

MOPSUCRE'NE (MJ^ou Kpvi'imi), a town in the i

ea-stern part of Cilicia, on the river Cydnus, and not

far from the frontier of Gataonia to which Ptolemy

(v. 7. § 7), in fact, assigns it. Its site was on the

southern slope of Mount Taurus, and in the neigh­

bourhood of the mountain pass leading from Cilicia

into Cappadocia, twelve miles north of Tarsus. It

is celebrated in history as the place where the em-

}*ror Constantius died, A. i>. 301. (Soiom. v. 1;

Pbilostorg. vi. 5 ; Eutrop. x. 7 ; Ainm. Marc. xxi. 29;

Jtiit. Ant. p. 145, where it is called Namsucrone;

It. Uierot. p. 579, where its name is mutilated into

Maiisvrrine.)

MOPSUE'STIA (M'tyov «Vr/a or Mo^uixo-na ■

Kth. Moi^fOTTjs), a considerable town in the extreme

east of Cilicia, on the river Pyramus, and on the

road from Tarsus to Issus. In the earlier writers

the town is not mentioned, though it traced its

origin to the ancient siiothsayer Mopsus; but Pliny

(v. 22), who calls it Moi»sos, states that in

his time it was a free town. (Comp. Strab. xiv.

p. 676; Cic. ad Fam. iii. 8; Steph. R. s. v.;

built at M"psuestia by the emperor Constantius.

(Malala, Chrvn. xiii.) lt was situated only 12

miles from the coast, in a fertile plain, called 'AAt/iui'
