ORESTAE ('OpeWoi, Hecat. ap. Slepk. B. : r.;

Thuc. ii. 80; l'olyb. xviii. 30; Strab. vii. p. 326,

ix. p. 434; Plin. iv. 17), a people who are shown

by Thucydides (/. c.) to have bordered upon the

Macedonian Paravaci, and who partly, perhaps, as

having been originally an Epirote tribe (Steph. B.

*. t). terms them a Molossian tribe), were united  
with the other Epirots, under their prince Antiochus,

in support of the expedition of Cneinus and the Am-

braciots against Acarnania. Afterwards they were

incorporated in the Macedonian kingdom. In the

peace finally granted to Philip, B c. 196, by the

Romans, the Orestae were declared free, because

they had been the first to revolt. (Liv. xxxiii. 34.)

Orestis ('Opeo-Tis, Ptol. iii. 13. §§ 5, 22; Steph.

B. s. r.; Liv. xxvii. 33, xxxi. 40) or Okestiab

('OptoTiar, Strab. vii. p. 326), was the name given

to the district which they occupied, which, though

it is not named by I.ivy and Diodorus among the

countries which entered into the composition of the

Fourth Macedonia, was probably included in it, be­

cause the greater part, at least, of Orestis was situ­

ated to the E, of Pindus. This subdivision of Upper

Macedonia is represented by the modern districts of

Grdmista, Anatelitza, and Kastoria. (Leake,

/Northern Greece, vol. iii. p. 305, vol. iv. pp. 121—

124.) [E. B.J.]

ORESTHA'SIUM ('OptaSiatov, Paus.; 'Opi-

oBuoy, Thuc; 'Opforeio!', Her., Eur.), a town in the

south of Arcadia, in the district of Maenalia, a little

to the right of the road, leading from Megalopolis to

Pallantium and Tegea. Its inhabitants were re­

moved to Megalopolis on the foundation of the latter

city. Its territory is called Orestliit by Thucydides

(iv. 134), and in it was situated Ladoceia, which

became a suburb of Megalopolis. [Ladoceia.]

Leake places Oresthasium at or near the ridge of

Tzimbaru, and conjectures that it may have occu­

pied the site of the village of Marmara or Marnui-

ria, a name often attached in Greece to places where

ancient wrought or sculptured stones have been

found. (Paus. viii. 44. § 2, comp. viii. 3. § 1, 27. §

3, 39. §4; Herod, ix. 11; Plut. Aritt. 10; Thuc. v.

ORETA'NI ('npnroW, Ptol. ii. 6. § 59), a

powerful people in the S. of Hisjunia Tarraconensis,

inhabiting the territory E. of Baetica, as fsr as Car­

thago Nova, and spreading to the N. beyond the

river Anas. The Baetis flowed through their

country in its earliest course. (Polyb. x. 38, xi.

30; Strab. iii. pp. 152, 156; Plin. iii. 3. s. 4; Liv.

xsi. 11, xxxv. 7.) Thus they inhabited the E. part

of Granada, the whole of Mancha, and the W. part

of Murcia. Their chief city was Castulo, now

Catlona. [T. H. D.]

for the Oretani (" Oretani, qui et Gcrmani nomi-

nantur," Plin. iii. 3. s. 4), and Oretum was one of

their towns; probably the Orisia of Artemiiiorus,

quoted by Steph. B. (s. v.), and the Oris of Straba

(iii. p. 152). It has been identified with Granatula,

a village near Almagro, where there is a hermitage

still called De Orelo, and close by several ruins, a

Roman bridge, &c. (Morales, Ant p. 8, b.. p. 76, a.;
