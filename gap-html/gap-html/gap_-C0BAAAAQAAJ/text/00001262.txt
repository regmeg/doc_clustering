THOKNAX (0<ipra{). 1. A mountain near the

city of Hennione in Argolis, between whirl] and Mt.

Pron the road run from Hermione t<» Halice. It

was subsequently culled Coccygium, because Zeus

was said to have been here transformed into a cuckoo;

and on its summit was a temple of Zeus Coccygius.

(Paus. ii. 36. 1, 2; Leake, Pehponnesiaca, p.

2S8; Curtius, Peloponnesus, vol. ii. p. 463.)

2. A mountain in Laconia, on the road from

Sparta to Sellasia, upon which stood a colossal sta­

tue of Apollo Pythaeus. (Herod, i. 6'J; Paus. iii. lU.

§ 8; Steph. B. s. v.; Leake, Morea, vol. ii. p. 534,

JMoponnesiaca, pp. 34S, 352; Boblaye, Reck. p. 75;

THO'SPIA (0w<nrfo, Ptol. v. 13. § 19, viii. 19.

§ 12), the capital of the district Thospitia. [T. H.D.]

THOSPI'TIS (©c^Ti-ms, Ptol. v. 13. § 18), a

district of Armenia Major. It lay at the northern

side of the Lacus Thospites (v &0}<tv7ti$ At^n/,

Ptol. ib. § 7), through which the Tigris flowed (Plin.

vi. 27. s. 31). It is perhaps the same lake tailed

Thonitis orThopitis by Strabo (Swiutis or ©onrirtj,

xl. p. 529), and Priscian (Lacus Thonitidis, Perieg,

913), the water of which is described by Strabo as

nitrous and uudrinkable. It is probably the modern

Wan, in the district of Tatp, and hence called by

the Armenians Dzoto TospaL [T. H. 1).]

if not exclusively, employed of gladiator->), a country

at the south-eastern extremity of Europe, and sepa­

rated from Asia only by the Propontis and its two

narrow channels, the Bosporus and the Hellespont.

I. Name. — Besides its ordinary name, the coun­

try had, according to Steph. B. (.<». v.), two older ap-

pellations, UtpKn and 'Apia; and Gellius (xiv. 6)

mentions Sithon as another. Ue.->pectmg the origin

of the->e names, various conjectures have been made

both in ancient and in modern times; but as none of

them, with the exception to be presently mentioned,

are of much value, it is not worth while to devote

any space to their consideration. * The exception

alluded to is the etymology adopted by (Jol. Mure

{Hist, of Lang, and Lit. of Anc. Greece, i. p. 153,

nole), which is far more probable and satisfac­

tory than any other that the present writer has seen,

and which derives the name Thrace from the adjec­

tive Tpaxe'a» '* rugged," by the common transfer of

the aspirate. Thus the name would indicate the geo­

graphical character of the various districts to which

it is given; for, as we shall see, it was by no means

confined to the country which is the special subject

of the present notice.

II. Extent. — In the earliest times, the region

tailed Thrace had no detmitc boundaries, but was

often regarded as comprising all that part of Kuroi>e

which lies to the north of Greece. Macedonia, in

the south, is spoken of by Hecataeus as belonging to

it (cf. Mel. ii, 2, sub tin., where the Chalcidic pen­

insula is described under the title of Thrace); and
