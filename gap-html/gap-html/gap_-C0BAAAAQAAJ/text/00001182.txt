1096 TARENTUM.

TARENTUM.

loss Oiat Herodotus, without &tating the numbers,

says it was the greatest slaughter of Greeks that

had occurred up to his lime. The loss seems to

have fallen especially upon the nobles and wealthier

citizens, so that it became the occasion ot'a political

revti] hi i m, and the government, which had pre-

viourdv been an aristocracy, became thenceforth a

pure democracy. (Arist. Pol. v. 3.) Of the in­

ternal condition and constitution of Tarentum pre­

viously to this time, we know scarcely anything,

but it seems probable that its institutions were at

first copied from those of the parent city of Sparta.

Aristotle speaks of its government as a iroAtTcia, in

the sense of a mixed government or common wealth;

while Herodotus incidentally notices a king of Ta­

rentum (iii. 156), not long before the Persian War,

who was doubtless a king after the Spartan model.

The institutions ot a democratic tendency noticed

with commendation by Aristotle {Pol. vi. 5) pro­

bably belong to the later and democratic period of

the constitution. We hear but little also of Tarentum

in connection with the revolutions arising out of the

influence exercised by the Pythagoreans: that sect

had apparently not established itself bo strongly

there as in the Achaean cities; though many Taren-

tincs are enumerated among the disciples of Pytha­

goras, and it is clear that the city had not altogether

escaped their influence. (Iambi. Vit. Pyth, 262,

Porphyr. Vit Pyth, 56.)

The defeat of the Tarentines by the Messapians,

which is referred by Diodorus to B. C-473 (Diod.

xi. 52). is the first event in the history of Tarentum

to which we can assign a definite date. Great as

that blow may have been, it did not produce any

permanent effect in checking the progress of the

city, which still appears as one of the most flourish­

ing in Magna Graecia. We next hear of the Ta­

rentines as interfering to prevent the Thurians, who

had been recently established in Italy, from making

themselves masters of the district of the Siritis.

On what grounds the Tarentines could lay claim to

this district, which was separated from them by the

intervening territory of Melaponturn, we are not in­

formed; but they carried on war for some time

against the Thurians, who were supported by the

Spartan exile Cleandridas; until at length the dis­

pute was terminated by a compromise, and a new

colony named Heracleia was founded in the con­

tested territory (b. c. 432). in which the citizens of

both states participated, but it was agreed that

it should be considered as a colony of Tarentum.

(Antioch. up. Strab. vi. p. 204; Diod. xii. 23, 36.)

At the time of the Athenian expedition to Sicily,

the Tarentines kept aloof from the contest, and

contented themselves with refusing all supplies

and assistance to the Athenian fleet (Time. vi.

44), while they afforded shelter to the Corinthian

and Laconian ships under Gylippua {lb. 104),

but they did not even prevent the second fleet

under Demosthenes and Eurymedon from touch­

ing at the islands of the Choerades, immediately

opposite to the entrance of their harbour, and taking

on board some auxiliaries furnished by the Messa­

pians. (Id. vii. 33.)

Another long interval now elapses, during which

the history of Tarentum is to us almost a blank;

yet the tew notices we hear of the city represent it

as in a slate of great prosperity. We are told

that at one time (apparently about 380—360 B.C.)

Archytas, the Pythagorean philosopher, exercised a

paramount influence over the government, and tilled

the office of Strategus or eeneral no Te^> 4dar, sr^i
