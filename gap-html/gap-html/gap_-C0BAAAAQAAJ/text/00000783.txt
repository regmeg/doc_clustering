ilt'UIG.VI. a German tribe on the right hunk

id north of the Longobardi,

which may have derived its name from its inhabiting

a marshy district, or from reed or rud. (Tac.

Germ. 40.) Various conjectures have been hazarded

about their exact abodes and their name, which some

have wished to change into Reudingi or Deuringi, so

as to identify them with the later Thuringi; but all

is uncertain. [L. S.]

REVESSIO ('Pi!*™*), in Gallia, is the city of

the Vellavi, or Velauni, as the name is written in

Ptolemy (ii. 7. § 20). Revessio is the name of the

place in the Table. In the Not Provinc. it is

written Civitas Vellavorum. Mabillon has shown

that the place called Civitas Vetula in the middle

ages U i. Paulim or PauBum, and the Civitas

Vetula is supposed to be the ancient capital of the

Vellavi. & Paulien is in the department of Haute

Loire, north of Le Puy. [G. L.]

Agathem. ii. 10: Volga) a river of Asiatic Sar-

tnatia, which according to Ptolemy (I c), the

earliest geographer who had any accurate know-

ledge of this longest of European streams, had its

twin sources in the E. and W. extremities of the

Hyperborean mountains, and discharged itself into

the Hyrcanian sea. The affluents which Ptolemy

(vi. 14. §4) describes as falling into it from the

Rhyminici Monies, and which must not be con­

founded with the river Rbymmus [Kiivmmus], are

the great accession made to the waters of the

Volga by the Kama in the government of Kasan.

Ammianus Marcellimis (/. c.) says that its banks

were covered with the plant which bore the same

name as the river — the "rha" or "rheon"

of Dioscorides (fta, biiov, iii. II) and "rhacoma"

of Pliny (xxvii. 105), or officinal rhubarb. (Comp.

Pereira, Mat. Med. vol. ii. pt. 1. p. 1343.)

The old reading Rha in the text of Poinponius

Mela (iii. 5. § 4) has been shown by Tzschucke

(ad loc.) to be a mistake of the earlier editors, for

which he substitutes Casius, a river of Albania.

The Oakus ("Oopoj, Herod, iv. 123, 124), where,

according to the story of the Scythian exjiedition,

the erection of eight fortresses was supfmsed to

mark the extreme point of the march of Dureius,

has been identified by Klaproth, and Schafarik

(Slav. Alt. vol. i. p. 499)—who mentions that in

the language of some tribes the Volga is still

called "Rhttu"—with that river. [E. B. J.]

KHAABE'M ('PaaSVof), a people of Arabia

Dcserta, next to the Agabeni, who were on the con­

fines of Arabia Kelix. (Ptol. v. 19. § 2.) Above

them were the Masnni; the Orcbeni lay between

them and the NW. extremity of the Persian Gulf.

Ptolemy rather indicates the direction, than defines

the positions, of these several tribes." (Geog. of
