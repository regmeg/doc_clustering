CI 3 PHOENICIA PHOENICIA.

Australia, as distinguished from our occupation of

India. A modern writer lias, with much erudition and

ingenuity, endeavoured to trace the progress ot

Phoenician colonisation from the threefold cycle of

ancient myths respecting the wanderings of Bel or

Baal—the Cronos of the Greeks, and patron cod of

By bins anil Berytus; of Astarte or Io (Venus-

Urania), who was especially worshipped at Sidon;

and of Melcarth or the Tyrian Hercules. (Movers.

Pltoen. vol. ii. pt. ii. eh. 2.) With these myths are

combined the legends of the rap of Europa, of the

wanderings of Cadmus anil Marmonia, of Helen,

Dido, &c. That some portion of historical truth

may lie at the bottom of these myths can hardly be

disputed; but a critical discussion of them would

require more space than can be here devoted to the

subject, and we must therefore content ourselves

with giving a -short sketch of what seems to he the

most probable march of Phoenician colonisation.

Cvprus, which lay within sight of Phoenicia, was

probably one of the first places colonised thrnce.

Its name of Chittim, mentioned in Genesis (x.), is

preserved in that of Citium, its chief town. (Cic.

Fin. iv. 20) Paphos and Palaopaphos, at the

SW. extremity of the island, and Golgos, near the

SE. [joint, were the chief seats of the worship of

Venus-Urania, the propagation of which marked

the progress of Phoenician colonisation. The origin

of the colony is likewise shown by the legend of

the conquest of Cyprus by Belus, king of Sidon

(—'■ turn Belus opinium Vastabat Cyprum, et victor

ditione tenebat," Virg. Aen. i. 6*21, et ib. Serv.), who

was (he reputed founder of Citium, Lapathus, and

other Cyprian towns. (Alex. Ephes. in Slepkan. v.

Aiiirij^os.) A great many Phoenician inscriptions

have been found in tins island. Hence the Phoe­

nicians seem to have proceeded to the coast of Asia

Minor, the islands of the Greek Archipelago, and the

co:nt of Greece itself". Phoenician myths and tra­

ditions are interwoven with the earliest history of

Greece, and long precede the Trojan War. Such

are ttie legends of Agenor in Cilicia, of Europa in

Rhodes and Crete, of Cadmus in Tbasos, Boeotia,

Euhoea and Thera. Rhodes seems to have been

early visited by th*1 Phoenicians; and, if it did not

actually become their colony, there are at least

numerous truces that they were once predominant in

the island. It is mentioned in Genesis (x. 4) in con­

nection with Citium and Taitessus. (Comp. Epiphan.

adv. finer?*. 30. 25, and Movers, vol. ii. pt. ii. p.

248. note 127.) Conon, a writer who flourished in

the Augustan period, mentions tiiat the Heliades,

the ruling dynasty in Khodes, were expelled by the

Phoenicians {Fab. 47. ap. Phot. p. 187), and

■numerous other tradirions testify their occupation of

the island. Traces of the Phoenicians may also be

found in Crete, though they arc fainter there than

at Rhodes. It is the scene of the myth of Europa,

the Sidonian Astarte; and the towns of Itanos, which

also bore the name of Aradeu (Steph. B. s. v. *\t<xv6s;

Hierocl. §11; Arts, xxvii. 12), I.ebena, and Phoe-

nice, were reputed to have been founded by them.

We Icam from Thucydides (i. 8) that, the greater

part of the Cyclades were colonised by Phoenicians.

There are traces of them in Cilicia. Eycia, and

Caria. We have already alluded to their intimate

connection with the last-named country, and Thucy­

dides, in the passage just cited, mixes the Carians

and Phoenicians together. Chios and Samos are

also connected with tin1 Phoenicians by ancient

myths; and at Tencdos, Melicertes, worshipped with

the sacrifice of infants, is the Tyrian Meclarih. "u»

called Palaemon by the Greeks. (Lveophr. '*»

229.) There are traces of Phoenician 00***5 a

Bithynia, but not more eastward in the Etim

tended farther. Mythological anabgie* lo&nn

The fable ran. that they had come thither ic m&

for the purposes of mining at M'-unt Panganf ■

Cadmus and Ins Arabs once dwelt at Ctr^s *

Euboea, having crossed over from Boeotia, Ui til

settlement of the Phoenicians in the Utter retry)

there is historical testimony, to whatever emLt-^

tlie legend of Cadmus may be entitl**d. (H*r>H

Paphians, the ancient inhabitants of Cepbdfed

were the reputed descendants of Cadmus.

To colunise Sicily required bolder nar.:***

people, the Phoenicians seized its pre^jnwn'5 4
