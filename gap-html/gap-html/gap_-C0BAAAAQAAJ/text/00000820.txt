ROMA. ROMA.

see no reason why Janus, a very ancient Latin

divinity, and to whom the Mona Janiculus appears

to have been sacred before the building of Rome,

should not have been honoured with a regular temple

besides the little affair which was the index of peace

and war. As the question, however, is connected

with the situation of the Argiletum and Forum

Caesaris, we shall have occasion to revert to it, and

have mentioned it here only becau.se the legend of

Tarpeia. and consequent building of the temple, are

closely connected with the history of the city.

K'imiilus, after his mysterious disappearance, was

deified under the name of Quirinus, and his suc­

cessor, Numa, erected a temple to the new God on

the Quirinah (Dionys. ii. 63; Ov. Fast. ii. 509).

This liill, which w;ts previously named Agonus

(Fest. p. 254; Dionys. ii. 37), appears in the time

of Nunm to have been divided into four distinct

eminences, each named after some deity, namely,

Quirinalis, Salutaris, Mucialis, and Latiaris (Varr.

L.L. v. § 51, Mull.); but from what deity the

name of Mucialis was derived remains inexplicable.

The name of Quirinalis, which, however, some derive

from the (Juirites, who had come with Tatins from

Cures, and settled on the hill (Varr. and Fest. //. CO.),

ultimately swallowed up the other three. The

temple of Quirinus probably stood near the pre­

sent church of A'. .-1 ttdrea <h I Noviziato. I his

question, however, as well as that concerning the

sites of the other three temples, will recur when

treating of the tojio^raphy of the city. Numa,

who wa> himself a Sabine, also founded a capital

(Hieron. i. p. subsequently called, by way

of distinction, "vet us Capitol'ium," on the Qui-

rinal, which hill had been chiefly colonised by his

countrymen. Of course the name of" Capitolium"

could not have been applied to it till after the found­

ation of the I toman Capitol, and originally it was

the arx of the city,containing the three usual temples

of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva. (Varr. L.L. v. §

158, Mull.) This ancient temple of Jupiter is al­

luded to by Mart ial (v. 22. 4). and probably stood

on the southern part of the Quirinal on the present

height of Maipuinrtpoli.

Tuihis Hostilius is slid to have added the Caelian

bill to the city after the destruction of Alba Longa,

when the population of Koine was doubled by the in­

habitants of Alba being transferred thither ; and in

order t" render the Caelian still more thickly inha­

bited Tullus chose it for his own residence. (I.iv. i.

30; Lutrop. i. 4; Victor, Vir. III. 4.) The two

accounts of the incorporation of this hill by Komulus

and Tullus contain, as we have before remarked,

nothing contradictory ; otherwise, Dionysius Hah- I

carna^senH.-. would hardly have committed himself

by adopting them both (ii. 30, 50, iii. 1). The

first Tuscan settlement had been transferred to

another place. Hut when Cicero (<fe Rep. ii. 18)

and Strain) (v. p. 234) state that the Caelian was

added to the city by Aneus Martius, this is a real

divergence tor which we cannot account ; as the hill

could hardly have been incorporated by Tullus and

again by Aneus.

Aneus is also said, by the two authorities just

quoted, to have added the A vent hie; and there is no

improbability in this, for Romulus never made it a

proj.«?r part of his city, and we learn from Plutarch

(Sum. 15) that it was uninhabited in the time of

Numa. We must remember that tlie earlier en­

closures were made rather to ;u-s,ert a future claim

to the ground wheu the number of citizens was in­

creased, than that they were absolutely wir.vi i
