• *<«*rj Expire, when it figures in the Gothic

wars as a place of some importance from its strength

as a fortress, and was one of the last strongholds

maintained by the Goths against Norses (Procop.

B. G. ir. 34). It early became an episcojial bee, a

dignity which it has retained without intermission

till the present time, though now but an insignificant

town with about 1500 inhabitants.

The only remains of antiquity now visible at Kepi

are some ancient sepulchres hewn in the rock, and

some portions of the ancient walls, much resembling

in their construction those of Sutrium and Falerii.

These are considered by Dennis as belonging to the

ancient Etruscan city; but it is more probable that

they date only from the Roman colony. (Dennis's

Etruria, vol. i. p. 111; Nibby, Dintorni, vol ii.

p. 398.) [E. H. B.]

NE'PHELIS (NeipeX/s), a small town on the

coast of Cilicia, situated, according to Ptolemy (v. 8.

§ 1), between Antioch and Anemurium; but if, as

some suppose, it be the same place as the ZttytAtov

mentioned in the Stadiasmus Maris Magni (§§ 181,

182), it ought to be looked for between Selinus and

Celendcris. Xoar the place was a promontory of the

same name, where, according to Livy (xxxiii. 20),

the fleet of Antiochus the Great was btatioued, when,

after reducing the towns of Cilicia as far as Selinus,

he was engaged in the siege of Coracesium, and

where he received the ambassadors of the Rhodians.

(Comp. Leake, Atia Minor, p. 119.) [L. S.]

NE'PHERIS (Niptpis), a natural fortress situ­

thage. (Strab. xvii. p. 834.) . [E. B. J.]

NEKEAK, a tribe, mentioned with several others,

who are equally unknown, by Pliny, and placed by

him in the neighbourhood of the Insula Pattalene,

the modern Saunuhtran (vi. 20. s. 23). [V.]

NERE'TUM, or KERITUM (NVrrof, Ptol. i

Eth. Meretinus: Nardi), a city of the Sallentini, in

the ancient Calabria, mentioned both by Ptolemy

and Pliny among the inland towns of that people.

Its name is also found in the Tabula, which fixes

its position 29 M. P. from Manduria on the rood to

Uxentum (Ugtnto), and 20 M. P. from the latter

city. These data enable us to identify it with cer­

tainty with the modem town of Nurdi, a con­

siderable place about 9 miles N. of CaUipoli. It

is clear from Pliny that it was a town of inuniciiial

rank, and the same thing is confirmed by inscrip­

tions; but there arc no ancient remains at Nardo.

(Plin. iii. 11. s. 16; Ptol. iii. 1. § 76; Tab. Peut.;

Orel I. Inter. 3108. Other inscriptions, with the

name of husic, KERIT. published by Muratori,

vol. ii. pp. 1113, 1120, and by Ilomanelli, vol. ii.

pp. 49, 50, are probably spurious. See Orelli,

NERIGOS. PUny (iv. 16. s. 30), in speaking of

the islands in the north of Britain, says that, according

to some, Nerigos was the largest, and that from it

people used to sail to Thule. As besides this pas­

sage we have no other information, it is impossible,

with absolute certainty, to say what island is meant;

but as Norway is in Danish still called Norge, and

in Swedish Norrige, it is now generally assumed

that Nerigos is tbe modem Norway; the south­

western headland of which, projecting into the sea,

might easily lead the ancients to the belief that it was

an island. In the same passage Pliny mentions the

island of Bergi, which may possibly be only the
