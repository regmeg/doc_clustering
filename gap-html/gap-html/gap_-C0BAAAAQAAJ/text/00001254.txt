test with L»ris«a, which was then under the 150-

vernment of Medius, probably tlic head of the

Atcu.1d.i6. Lycophron was supported by Sparta;

and Medina accordingly applied for succour to the

confederacy of Greek states which had been lately

formed to resist tlie Lacedaemonian power. With

their assistance Merlins took Pharsalus, which was

then occupied by ;i Lacedaemonian garrison, and is

Kaid to have sold all its inhabitants as slaves.

(Diod. xiv. 82.) The return of Agesilaus, and his

victory over the Tnessalians, probably deprived Me-

dius anil his party of their power, and Larissa no

longer appears as the rival of l'herae for the supre­

macy of Thessaly, Pharsalus soon recovered from

llie blow which it had received from Med i us, and

hpcame, next to Pherae, the most imporlaut city in

Thessaly. The inhabitants of Pharsalus agreed to

entrust the supreme power to Polydamaa, one of

their own citizens, in whose integrity and abilities

all parties placed the greatest confidence. The

acropolis and the whole management of the finances

were placed in bis hands, and lie discharged his

trust to the satisfaction of all parties. (Xcn. Udl.

vi. 1. §§ 2,3.)

Meantime the supreme power at Pherae had passed

into the hands of Jason, a man of great energy and

ability, and probably the son of Lycophron, though

this is not expressly stated. He inherited the ambi­

tions \iews of Lycophron, and meditated nothing

l"ss than extending his dominion over the whole of

Greece, for which bis central situation seemed to

oflffr many facilities. He cherished even still more

extensive projects of aggrandisement, and, once mas­

ter of Greece, he looked forward to conquer the Per­

sian empire, which the retreat of the Ten Thousand

Greeks and the campaigns of Agesilaus in Asia

seemed to point out as an easy enterprise. But the

first step wjis bis election as Tagus of Thessaly, and

the submission of all the Thcssalian cities to his

authority. For this purpose it was necessary to ob­

tain the acquiescence of Pharsalus, and although he

might have gained his object by force, he preferred

to effect it by negotiation, and accordingly frankly

disclosed his schemes to Polydannas, and ottered him

the second place in Thessaly, if he would support his

views. Polydamaa asked theadvice of the Spartans,

and finding that he could receive from them no help,

he acceded to the projxtsals of Jason, and induced

the Pharsalians to espouse his cause. .Sxin after

this, probably in 11. 0. 374, Jason was elected Tagns

of Thessaly, and proceeded to settle the contingent

of cavalry and heavy-armed troops which the Pbar-

salian cities were to furnish. He now possessed a

force of 8000 cavalry and more than 20.000 in­

fantry; and Alceta.s I., king of Kpeirus, and Amyn-

tas II., king of Macedonia were his allies. (Xen.

11.11 vi. I. 2 — 10; Diod. xv. 60.) He could in

effect command a greater force than any other state

in Greece; and from the disunion and exhaustion of

the other Grecian states, it seemed not improbable

that he might be able to carry his ambitions projects

into effect. He had already formed an alliance with

Thebes, and after the battle of Leuctra (B.C. 371)

he was invited by the Thebans to join them in

attacking the Lacedaemonian camp. Hut Jason's

policy was to prevent any other power from obtaining

the preponderance in Greece, ami accordingly upon

his arrival at Leuctra lie advised the Thebans not

to drive the Lacedaemonians to despair, and obtained

a truce for the latter, which enabled them to secure

their safety by a retreat (Xen Hell, vi. 4. § 20,

1 seq.) Tn the following year be iwwwi las ■>
