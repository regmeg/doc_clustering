('Qrraw). 1. An ancient city of

B.

Latium, situated on the confines of the Aequian

territory. It is twice mentioned during the wars of

the Romans with the latter people: first, in B.C. 481,

when we are distinctly told that it was a Latin city,

which was besieged and taken by the Aequians

(Liv. ii. 43; Dionys. viii. 91); and again in B.C.

457, when the Aequians, by a sudden attack, took

Corbio, and, after putting to the BWord the Koman

garrison there, made themselves masters of Orlona

also; but the consul Horatius engaged and defeated

them on Mount Algidus, and after driving them

from that position, recovered possession both of

Corbio and Ortona. (Liv. iii. 30; Dionys. x. 26.)

From these accounts it seems clear that Ortona was

situated somewhere in the neighbourhood of Corbio

and Mount Algidus; but we have no more precise

clue to its position. No mention of it is found in

later times, and it probably ceased to exist. The

name is much corrupted in both the passages of

Dionysius; in the first of which it is written 'Opoor,

but the Vatican MS. has 'Opura for 'Optoma: in

the second it is written Biprwi'a. It is very pro­

bable that the Hortenses, a people mentioned by

Pliny (iii. 5. s. 9) among the " populi Albenses," are

the inhabitants of Ortona; and it is possible, as

suggested by Niebuhr, that the ♦opru'tibi (a name

otherwise wholly unknown), who are found in Diony-

sius's list of the thirty cities of the Latin League, may

bo also the same people. (Dionys. v. 61; Niebuhr,

vol. ii. p. 18, note.) The sites which hare been

assigned to Ortona are wholly conjectural.

2. (Ortona a Mare), a considerable town of the

Frentani, situated on the coast of the Adriatic, about

midway between the month of the Aternus (Pes-

cara) and that of the Sagrus (Sanaro). Strabo

tells us that it was the principal port of the Fren­

tani (v. p. 242). He erroneously places it S. of the

Sagrus; but the passage is evidently corrupt, as is

one in which he speaks of Ortona or Histonium (for

the reading is uncertain) as a resort of pirates.

(Strab. /. c, and Kramer ad loc.~) Ptolemy correctly

places it between the Sagrus and tho Aternus;

though he erroneously assigns it to the Peligni.

Pliny mentions it among the municipal towns of the

Frentani; and there seems no doubt that it was one

of the principal places possessed by that people.

(Plin. iii. 12. s. 17; Ptol. iii. 1. § 19.) Some in­

scriptions have been published in which it bears the

title of a colony, but these are of dubious authen­

ticity (see Zumpt, de Colon, p. 358, note); it is not

mentioned as such in the Liber Coloniarum The

Itineraries place it on the road from the mouth of the

Aternus to Anxanuui(/.ancta»o). The name is still

retained by the modern town of Ortona; and antiqui­

ties found on the spot leave no doubt that it occupies

the same site with the ancient one. (/tin. A nt. p. 313;

Tab. Peut.; Romanelli, vol. iii. p. 67.) [E. H. B.]

ORTOI'LA ("OpTorXo, Ptol. ii. 17. §3; Orto-

pula, Plin. -iii. 25), a town of the Libumi, identi­

fied with Carlopago or Carlobago, in the district of

the Morlacca, where several Roman remains have

been found. (Neigebaur, Die Sud-Slaven, pp. 225,

228.) [E. 15. J.]
