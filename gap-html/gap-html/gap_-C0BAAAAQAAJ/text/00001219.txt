I LV riBL'RGIUM or TEUTOBURGIUM (T.o-

lucres of the Dravua and l>anubius, on the

1 man ilursa to Comacuin, was the statiou of

fraefect of Uia sixth legion and a corps of

naliati iiorsemen. (/(. Ant. p. 243; Ptol.

o § 5; Sot.t. Imp.; Tub. Petit., where it is

arilteB Tittoburgium.) The name seems to

utt thai it was originally a settlement of the

Teutones, which may hare been founded at the time

when they roamed over those countries, about

B. c. 113. No remains are now extant, and its

exact site is only matter of conjecture. (Muchar,

A'orikum, vol. i. p. 265.) [L. S.]

TEUTOBERGIENSIS SALTUS, a mountain

forest in Western Germany, where in a.d. 9 the

Roman legions under Varus suffered the memorable

defeat, and where, six years later, their uiiburied

remains were found by Drusns. (Tac. Ann. i. 60.)

A general description of the locality without the

mention of the name is found in Dion Cassins

(Ivi. 20, 21; comp. Veil. Pat. ii. 105, 118, foil.).

This locality has in modem times been the subject

of much discussion among German antiquaries;

but the words of Tacitus seem to imply clearly that

he was thinking of the range of hills between the

sources of the I.upia and Amasis; that is, the range

between Lippspringe and llawtenbeck. (Giefers,

Be Alisone Cattelio deque Varianae CUulu Loco

Commentatio. p. 47, foil ) [L. S.]

TEUTONES or TEUTONI (T.iW.j), the

name of a powerful Gennan tribe, which about

B. C. 113 appeared on the frontiers of Gaul at the

Bame time when the Cimbri, probably a Celtic people,

after defeating the Romans in several battles,

traversed Gaul and invaded Spain. The Teutones,

however, remained behiud ravaging Gaul, and were

joined by the Ombrones. At length, in u. c 102,

they were defeated by C. Marius in a great battle

near Aquae Scxtiae, where, according to the most

moderate accounts, 100,000 of them were slain,

while SO.000 or 90,000 are said to have been taken

prisoners. A body of 6000 men, who survived that

terrible day, are said to have established themselves

in Gaul between the Maat and Schelde, where they

became the ancestors of the Adualici. (Liv. EpiL

lib. Ixvii.; Veil. Pat. ii. 12; Hor. iii. 3; I'lut.

Mar. 36, foil.; Oros. v. 16; Caes. B. G. ii. 4, 29.)

After this great defeat, the Teutones are for a long

time not heard of in history, while during the

preceding t n years they are described as wandering

about the Up]#r Rhine, and eastward even as far

as Pannonia. In later times a tribe bearing the

name of Teutones is mentioned by Pomp. Mela

(iii. 3),Pliny (xxxvii. 11), and Ptolemy (ii. ll.§17)

as inhabiting a district in tho north-west of Ger­

many, on the north of the river Albis, where

according to Pliny, they dwelt even as early aa

the time of Pvtheas of Ma&silia. Tlie question

here naturally presents itself whether these Teutones

in the north of Germany were the same as those

who in the lime of Marius invaded Gaul in con­

junction with the Cimbri, who in fact came from

the same quarters. This question must be an­

swered in the affirmative; or in other words, tho

Teutones who appeared in the south were a branch

of those in the north-west of Germany, having

been induced to migrate southward either by inun­

dations or other calamities. The numerous body of

emigrants bo much reduced the number of lh<«e

remaining behind, that thereafter they were a tribe

of no great importance. That the name of Teutones

was never employed, either by the Germans thenu

selves or by the Romans, as a general name for tbe

whole German nation, has already been explained ill

the article Gekmania. Some writers even regard the

Teutones as not Germans at all, but either as Sla­

vonians or Celts. (Latham, Epileg. ad Tac. Germ.

p. ex.) The fact that the country between the lower

Elbe and tlie Baltic was once inhabited by the
