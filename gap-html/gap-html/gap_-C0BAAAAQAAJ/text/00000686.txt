on the Ejnatian n>:ul, 33 M. P. from Amphi'polis,

and 21 M. P. from Acontisma. (Ithi. Anton.;

/tin, Hierosol.) The Theodoj-ian Table presents

two minis from Philippi to Heraeleia Sintica. One

of the roads passed round tlie X. aide of the Juke

Cereinitis, measuring 55 M. P.. the other took

the S. side of the lake, and measured 52 M. P.

When Macedonia was divided into two provinces

by Theodosius the Younger, Philippi became the

ecclesiastical head of Macedonia Prima (Xeale,

Hut, of East. Church, vol. i. p. 92), and is men-

tinned in the Handbook of Hierocles.

The site, where there are considerable remains of

antiquity, is still known to tlie Greeks by its ancient

name: by the Turks the place is called Felibedjik.

PHILIPPI PROM. (+i\nnnw &Kpa, Stadiasm.

§ Ho), a headland on the e.iast of the Great Syrtis,

identical with the Hippi Pimm, of Ptolemy (iv. 3.

ij 14). and with the remarkable projection of hi^h

cliff into the sea. on which are traces of a strong

fortress, at Has firrtjatctid. Beechey (Expedition tit

the X. Cotut oj'Africa, p. 188) identities this cliff,

which he calls Bengerwad, with Euphrantas; but

Ibis is a mistake, as is shown by Bortfa (Wander-

iinqm, p. 367), who refers the station Ai> Turhem

(Pent. Tab.) to this headland. [E. U. J.]

PHILIPPO'POLIS. I. (tiAimrtfiroAis, Ptol. iii.

11. § 12; Polyb. v. 100; Slepli. B. a. r.), a town of

Thrace, founded by Philip "I Macedon, on the site

of a previously existing town, called Emnolpias or

Poneroix>Iis, (Amm. Marc. xxvi. 10. § 4; Plin. iv. 11.

s. IS) From its situation on a bill with three

peaks or summits, it was also called Triinonthun.

(Plin. Lc; VvA.l.c.) It lay on the SE. side of

the Hebrus. The Thraeians, however, regained

possession of it (Polyb. /. c.; Li v. xxxix. 53), and

it remained in their bands till they were .subdued by

tlie Romans. Its size may 1m: inferred from the fact

of the Goths having slaughtered 100,000 persons in

it (Amm, Marc. xxxi. 5. § 17). though doubtless

many persons from the environs bad taken refuge

there. The assumption that it likewise bore the name

of Hadrianopolis, rests only on an interpolation in

Ptolemy. It is still called Philtppopali, and con-

tinues to b<- one of the most considerable towns of

Thrace. (I'ac. Aim. iii. 38; I tin. Ant. y>. 130;

2. A city of Arabia, near Bostra, founded by the

Roman emperor Pbilippus, who reigned a. m. 244 —

de Caw. 28; Cedronus, p. 257, ed. Paris., vol. i. p.

451, od. Bonn; Zoiiar.xii. 19.) Some writers suppose

that Philippopolis wits only a later name of Bostra,

and it must be admitted that the words of Cedremis

and Zonaras are ambiguous; hut they are mentioned

as two different places in the Councils. (Labbei,
