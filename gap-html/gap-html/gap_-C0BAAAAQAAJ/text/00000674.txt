suffered from ilic attacks of the Aetolians and

Kleans. Its territory was annexed by Augustus to

Patrae, when the latter city was made a Roman

colony after the battle of Actinra. Pharae contained

a large agora, with a curious statue of Hermes.

The remains of the city have been found on the left

bank of the Karnvnitza, near Prevtzo. (Herod, i.

30. § 3: Kalamdki), an ancient town of Measenia,

situated upon a hill rising from the left hank of the

river Nedon, and at a distance of a mile from the

Mcsseiuan gulf. Strabo describes it as (situated 5

Madia from the sea (viii. p. 361), and Pausaniaa 6

(iv. 31. § 3); but it is probable that the earth

deposited at the mouth of tlie river Nedon has, in

the course of centuries, encroached upon the sea.

Pherae occupied the site of Kukwuita, the modern

capital of Messenia; and in antiquity also it seems

to have been the chief town in the southern Messe-

nian plain. It was said to have been founded by

Pilaris, the son of Hermes. (Paus. iv. 30. § 2.)

In the Iliad it is mentioned as the well-built city of

the wealthy Diodes, a vassal of the Atridae (v. 543),

and as one of the seven places offered by Agamem­

non tu Achilles (ix. 151); in the Odyssey, Telcma-

clius rests hereon his journey from Pylos to Sparta

(iii. 490). After the capture of Messene by the

Achaeans in b. c. 182, Pharae, Abia, and Thnria

separated themselves from Messene, and became

each a distinct member of the league. (Polyb. xxv.

1.) Pharae was annexed to Laconia by Augustus

(Paus. iv. 30. § 2), but it was restored to Mcssenia

by Tiberius. [Mbssejcia, p. 345.J Pansanias found

at Pharae temples of Fortune, and of Nicomachus

and Gorgasita, gnmdsons of Aselcpius. Outside the

city there was a grove of Apollo Carucius, and in it

a fountain of water. (Pans. iv. 30. § 3,seq.,iv. 31.

§ 1.) Strabo correctly describes Pharae as having

an anchorage, but only tor summer (viii. p. 361); and

at present, after the month of September ships retire

for safety to Armyro, so called from a river strongly

impregnated with salt flowing into the sea at this

place: it is the 05e*p OAjuipdV, mentioned by Pau-

sanias (iv. 30. § 2) as on the road from Abia to

Pharae.

There are no ancient remains at Kalamata,

which is not surprising, as the place has always been

well occupied and inhabited. The height above the

town is crowned by a ruined castle of the middle

ages. It was the residence of several of the Latin

chieftains of the Morea. W illiam Villehardouin II.

was born here. In 1685 it was conquered and

enlarged by the Venetians. It was the head­

quarters of the insurrection of 1770, and again of

the revolution of 1821, which spread from thence

over the whole peninsula. (Leake, Morea, vol. i.

p. 342, seq. ; bob lave, HecAerchss, *jr. p. 104;

PHARAN or PARAN ('bapdv), the name of a

desert S. of Palestine, between this country and

Aegypt. (Gm. xxi. 21 ; I Kings, xi. 18.) It is

usually identified with the Wady luin'm,a beautiful

and well watered valley, surrounded by mountains,

NW. of Sinai, and near the western arm of the

Red Sea (Xiebuhr, Rei*t Ix-schrrihtty, vcl L p. M

Arabia*) p. 402); but though Fdra» m*j a*

preserved the ancient name of the desert, it a,

pours from Nnmbcra (x. 12, 53, no. 26) tl

the latter was situated in the desert of Kaon

which was upon the borders of the coontrr if 1

Edomites, nnd which the Israelites reached al

their departure from Mt, Sinai, on their waj t^sj

the land of Edom. (Burckhardt, Syria, p. 618-1

In the Wady Feirt'm are the remains of an isci

church, assigned to the fifth century, and «1

was the seat of a bishopric as early uial

(Robinson, Biblical Researches, vol. i. p. II

This city is described under the name of Fa

by the Arabic Edrisi, about A. P. 1150, tad

Makrizi about a. d. 1400. (Bunkhardt, if

p. G17.) It is apparently the same as Pharsa(<

pay), described by Stephanus B. (#. r.) a* a <

between Aegypt and Arabia, and by Ptolemy (t.

§§ 1, 3) as a city of Arabia Petraea near the m

era arm of the Red Sea. A species of uaed

found in this valley had the name of Pbusl

(Plin. xxxvii. 9. s. 40.) The valley of Pbaraml

tinned by Joseph us (B. J. iv. 9. § 4) is obnam

different place from the Wady Feiran, somewhat

the vicinity of the Dead Sea, and is perhaps

connected with the desert of Paran, spsku

above. (Robinson, Biblical Researches, rxL I
