which the mins still remain. Throughout the whole

of Mannarica do vestiges of AcgyptiaD architecture

before the Greek period have been found. The sea-

onion, usciltamaritima,n and madder, "rubia," which

cover the plains, remind the traveller of what Hero-

dotus (iv. 189,190) says about the practice of the

Libynu women dying their goat-skins with red, and of

the portable houses constructed of stalks of asphodel,

intertwined with rushes. Now, as then, the u jerboa"

(Mkous, Herod, iv. 192) is common. The few coins

of Marmaric towns, such as those of Apis and

Batrachus, are of the same workmanship as the

Aegyptian mints. (Eckhel, vol. iv. p. 116.)

Ptolemy (iv. 5. § 22) enumerates the following

tribes in Marmarica:—In the Lybian nome, along the

coast, the Zygkitae (Zuyonai), Ciiattam (Xar-

Taroi), and Zygenses (Zi/yeir); further to the S.,

in the interior, the lit ji.sms (BooftiV) and Oo-

daf.mi. In the di.-trict of Ammonium (§ 23), the

Anagombri ('Avdyopgpoi), Iobacciii ('IoSojc-

Xoi), and Rt uhtak ('PovaSirai). In the Mar­

maric nome, to the N., on the coast, the I.iky

akciiak (AiSu<lf>xa')> the Axekitar (Arnpirai),

and Bassachitae (Boo-axcr""); to the S. of these,

the Ai i.n w. (Ao-vlAai), Nasamones (Naaa/iii-

«5), and Bacatae (Bokotoi); tlicn the Auscm-

sae (Auffxhrai), who belong more properly to Cy-

rcnaica; Tapaxitae (Tawaylrat); .-nil further to

the S. lheSKNTiTE9(2crTiT«s), Obilab ('OS(Aoi),

and Akzaki (Af^iafioi).

MAROBU'DUM (tiapieovtiiy), a town of the

M-m'<>ii lii mi in Bohemia (Ptol. ii. 11. § 29), and

undoubtedly identical with the royal residence of

Maroboduus, with a fortress attached to it, mentioned

by Tacitus. {Ann. ii. 62.) The same place, or

rather the fortress, is called by Strabo (vii. p. 290)

Buiaeinon, and is identified with the modem Budarii,

in Bohemia. [L. S.]

MAKOXEIA (Mapwvua: Eth. Mapuvlrn!), a

rich and powerful city of the Cicones, in Thrace,

situated on the Aegean sea, not far from the lake

Imnaris. (Herod, vii. 109.) It was said to have

been founded by Maron, a son of I)ionysus (Eurip.

Cycl. v. 100, 141), or, according to some, a com­

panion of Osiris (Diod. Sic. i. 20); but Scymnus

(675) relates that it waa built by a colony from

Chios in the fourth year of the fifty-ninth Olympiad

(b. c. 540). Pliny (iv. 11. -. 18) tells us that

the ancient name was Ortagurea. The people of

'■I 1 ... 1 venerated Dionysus in an especial manner,

as we learn from their coins, probably on account of

the sujierior character of their wine, which was cele­

brated as early as the days of Homer (Od. i. 40).

This wine was universally esteemed all over the

nm-ient world; it was said to possess the odour of

Nectar (Xonnus, i. 12, xvii. 6, xix. 11), and to bo

capable of mixture with twenty times its quantity

of water (Horn. Od. ix. 197); and, according to

Pliny, on an experiment being made by Mucianns,

who doubted the tnith of Homer's statement, it was

fnunil to bear even a larger propr*tion of water,

(Plin. xiv. 4. s. 6; comp. "Victa Maroneo foedatus

luniina Baccho," Tibull. ir. 1. 57).

Maroneia was taken by Philip V. of March,n in

B. c. 200 ; and wlien he was ordered by the Romans

to evacuate the towns of Thrace, he vented his rage

by slaughtering a great number of the inhabitants of

the city. (I.iv. xxxi. 16, xxxix. 24; Polyb. rxH.

6, 13, xxiii. 11, 13.) The Romans subseqnemly

granted Maroneia to Attalus; but they almost imme­

diately afterwards revoked their gift, and declared it

a free city. (Polyb. xxx. 3.) By Con-tanune

Porphyrogenitus (Them. ii. 2), Maroneia is reckoned

among the towns of Macedon. Tlie modern nana*

is Marogna. and it has been the seat of an arrh-

bishopric. (Comp. Ptol. iii. 11. § 2; Scylax, p. 27

MARRUCI'NI (Mappowcimi, Pol., Strah.; Maf

povKivot, Ptol.), a nation of Central Italy, inhabiting

a narrow strip of territory on the S. bank of the

river Aternus, extending from tlie Adriatic to the

ridge of the Apennines. (Strab. v. p. 241.) They

were bounded on the N. by the Vestini, from wbnra

they were separated by the Atemus, ami on the 8.

by the Frentani, while to the W. and SW. they ap­

parently extended inland as far as the lufty moon-

tain barriers of the Majella and the Morrow*, which

sejiarated them from the Peligni, and effectually cot

them off from all intercourse with their neirhbouri

on that side, except by the valley of tlie A'ernoa.

The southern limit of their territory is not staled by

any ancient author, but was probably formed by the

river Foro, which falls into tlie Adriatic about

7 miles from the mouth of the Ateraua (/Vjmro).

Pliny, indeed, extends the district of the Frentasi

as far as the Aternus (Plin. iii. 12. s. 17). then

but there seems little doubt that this is erroneutss,

[Frentaki.] The Marrucini were, undoubtedly,

like the other tribes in their immediate neighbourhood,

of Sabine origin, and appear to have been closely coes-

nected with the Marsi, indeed, the two names are little

more than different forms of the same, a fact which

appears to have been already recognised by Cato

(oy>. 1'rucian. ix. p. 871). Bat, whether the Mar­

rucini were an offset of the Marsi, or both tribes

were separately derived from tbe common Ssbine

stock, we have no information. Tbe Marrorini

nations formed a kind of league for mutual defeats
