TEUTONO'AUI (TfvTovoapoi), a German tribe

THA'BRACA (Qafyatea KoXuvla, Ptol. vi. 3.

§S 5, 21, 28, viii. 14. § 3; Mela, i. 7), also called

Tahraca (Plin. v. 3. s. 2, G), a maritime city of Nu­

midia, seated at the mouth of the Tusca. It was

the border city towards Zeugitana, and a Roman

colony. (Ptol., Plin., //. cr.) The surrounding

country was covered with thick woods. (Juv. 5.

x. 104.) Thabraca was the scene of the death of

Gikio. (Claud. Laud. Stit. i. 359.) It still retains

the name of Tabarka. (Cf. Itm. Ant. pp. 21, 49.0,

514 ; Aug. adv. Donat. vi. 32.) [ i\ H. I>.]

THAI1RASTA, a place in the Libyan Nomos

(Itm, Ant. p. 72), identified by Lapie with Kasr

Bourn Adjonbuh. [T. H. D.]

TIIABU'SIUM, a fortress on the river Indus in

pria, on the Svrtis Major, according to Lapie near

Alt. Called tagulis in Tab. Ptut, [T. H. D.]

a mountain in Serica, stretching from the Ottoro-

eorras in a northerly direction towards the Asmiraean

monntiiins. It is in the S. part of the Mongol ter­

ritory, and N. of the Iloang-ho. [T. 11. D.]

THALA (0aAa, Strab. xvii. p. 831), an im­

portant town of Numidia, with a treasury and

arsenal. (Sail. J. 75, 77, 80, 89; Tac. Ann.

iii. 21; Flor. iii. 1.) It is probably identical with

'IVIeptc (TeAf7TTi7, Proeop. de. Atd. vi. 6), a for­

tified town of Numidia, lying to the N\V. of Capsa,

and from which there was a road to Tacape on the

Syrtis Minor (Jtin. Ant. p. 77). Shaw (7rap. vol.

i. p. 288, seq.) takes Eerreanalt, both from its ruins

and its situation, to have been the ancient Thala or

Telepte (of. Mannert, x. 2. p. 321), but Lapie seeks

it ut Hw,uch-el-Khima. [T. H. D.]
