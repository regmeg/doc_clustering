this district. In the interior was a vast lake, ex­

tending to the At'TARlATAE. A fertile island of

or Popoco). From this lake the river (lowed, at a

Voyage (huts la Greet, vol. i. p. 25.) This river

formed the S. boundary of" Dalmatia, and its hanks

were occupied by the Daorezi, Ardiaei and_ Paraei.

(Strak vii. pp. 315, 317.) These hanks were

famous in former times among the professors of

pharmacy, who are advised by Nicander (Therinca,

v. GOT) to gather the "Iris" there. (Plin. xiii. 2,

xxi. 19; Theophr. op. Athen.xw p. 681.) Straho (vii.

p. 317) rejects the statement of Theopompus that

the potters' clay of Chios and Thasos was found in

the bed of the river. For the valley of the Nartnta,

NAlIO'XA (Na^Slira, a mistake for Napwia, Ptol,

ii. 17. § 12. viii. 7. $ 8), a town in Dalmatia, and a

Boman "colonia." It appears from the letters of P.

Vatinius to Cicero (ad Fam. v. 9, 10), dated Xarona,

that the Romans made it their head-quarters dur­

ing their conquest of Dalmatia. (Comp. Pomp. Mela,

ii. 3. § 13; Itin. Anton.; Pent. Tab. ■ Geog. Rav.

iv. 16.) Karona was a "convent us," at which,

according to M. Varro (np Plin. iii. 2f>) 89 cities

assembled; in tlie time of Pliny (/. c.) this number

had diminished, but lie speaks of as many as 540

"decuriae" submitting to its jurisdiction.

The ancient city stood upon a hill now occupied

by the Village of Vido, and extended probably to the

marsh below; from the very numerous inscriptions

that have been found there, it appears that there

was a temple to Liber and Libera, as well as other

buildings dedicated to Jupiter and Diana. (Lanza,

sopra Tantica rittd di Xarona, Bolog na, 1842:

Neigebaur, Die Sud-Slaven, pp. 116, 122.) A coin

of Titus has been found with the epigraph Col*

Xarona. (Goltz, Thesaurus, p. 241 ; Rasche, vol.

iii. pt. i. p. 1048.)

When the Serbs <>r \V. Slaves occupied this

country in the reign of lleraoliiLs, Narenta, as it

was called, was one of the four " banats " into which

the Servians were divided. The Xarentine pirates,

who tor three centuries had been the terror of Dal­

matia and the Venetian traders, were in a. d. 997

entirely crushed by the fleet of Venice, commanded

bv the Doge in person. (Schafarik, Slar. Alt. vol. ii.

p. 2GG.) [E.B.J.]

NABTHA'CIUM (Nap^ioc: Elk. NapQaKtevt),

the name of a ftty and mountain of Phthiotis in

Thessaly, in the neighbourhood of which Agesilaua,

on his return from Asia in n. c. 394, gained a

victory over the Thessalian cavalry. The Thes-

Batians, after their defeat, took refuge on Mount

Narthacium, between which and a place named

Pras, Agesilaus set up a trophy. On the follow­

ing day he crossed the mountains of the Achaean

Phthiotis. (Xen. Hell. iv. 3. §§3—9; Ages. 2.

3—5; Plat. Apophth. p. 211; Died, xiv. 82.)

Narthacium is accordingly placed by Leake and

Kiepert south of Pharsalu.s in the valley of the

Eriipeus ; and the mountain of this name i» probably

the one which rises immediately to the southward of

Firscda. Leake supposes the town of Narthacium

to have been on the mountain not far from upper

Ijaterli, and Pras near lower Tjaterli. (Xortten

(iret-ee, vol. iv. p. 471, ^eq.) The town Nartbaciaa

is mentioned by Ptolemy (iii. 13. § 46), andthouid

probably be restored in a passage of StrtU i.

p. 434), where in the MS. there is only the tar*

mi nation tor. (See GroskurJ and K rimer,
