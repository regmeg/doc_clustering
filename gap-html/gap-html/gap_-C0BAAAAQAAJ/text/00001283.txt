TIBF.RIAS MAKE. 1197 TIBERIS.

rtnrch n.-rotlcH Antipas, in honour of the Roman

N ;-T"r Tiberius, from whom it derived its name.

l>«pli. £ c.) It is stated to hare been 30 stadia

wn Hippo, 60 from Gudara, and 120 from Scytbo-

u!ii (Joseph, Vit. 65); distances which are not

u'-h at variance with that of Jolifle, who states

bl it is 20 miles English from Nazareth and 90

tjii Jerusalem. ( Travels, p. 40.)

Knun the time of Herodes Antipas to that of the

OCD of Agrippa II-, Tiberias was probably the

il.tal of the province (Joseph. I'tt 9), and it was

:e uf the four cities which Nero added to the

iiirlom of Agrippa. (Joseph. Ant. xx. 8. § 4.)

i the last Jewish War, Tiberias, from its great

r^ifith, played an important part (Joseph. B. J. ii.

'i); as, after Sepphoris, it was held to be the

irgest place in Galilaea (Joeicph, Vit. 65), and was

sry strongly fortified, (B. J. iii. 10. § I.) The

^ai>itanta derived their sustenance in great mea-

lre from tbeir fisheries in the adjoining sea.

I.*cph. Vit. 12.) On the destruction of Jeru-

Jct, and for several centuries subsequently,

rrias was famous for its academy of learned

rwi. (Lightfoot, fair. Ilebr. p. 140.)

In the immediate neighbourhood of Tiberias were

• celebrated hot springs of Knunaus (Joseph.

. J. ii. 21, Ant. xviii. 2.) [F.mmais.] It is not

rtain whether Tiberias occupied the site of Chin-

nth. though Hieronymus thinks so ((?nom. s. v.

k\nivrtth) : it seems more likely that this place

: mfed to the tribe of Naphthali. (Josh. xix.

i; lirland, Palaart. p. 161.) Nor is there any better

i*cn for identifying it, as some have done, with

himmath (Joseph, xix. 35) or Uakkah, which was

•• l^bbinical notion. (Cf. Hieron. Megil. fol. 701 j

tflitfoot, Churograph. Cent. cap. 72—74.) The

»!an name of Tiberias is Tabarieh: it is not,

■ icrtr, built Actually on the site of the old town,

-i.'li close to its ruins. When Joliffe was there, it  
d a population of 11,000 (Travels, pp 48—58.)

*u nearly destroyed by an earthquake on New  
air's Day, 1837, since which time it has never

n> completely rebuilt. (Uusseggcr, iii. p. 132;

TIBE'RIAS MAKE (Al^m T.*V«, Pausan. v.

§ 4; PtoL v. 16. § 4; \lfun\ ij 'liGtplav, Joseph.

J. iv. 26), the principal lake or sea of Palestine in

• frTince ot' Galilaea. It was bordered on the

. tide by the tribes of Issachar and Zabulon, and

the E. by the half-tribe of Manassch. The

Hers were fresh (Joseph. B. J. iii. 35) and

11 rf Gab (Joseph. B. J. iv. 26; Malik, iv.

1; Late, v. 1, &c), and its size is variously

ttal, by Joscphus (/. c), to have been 140 stadia

; ' v 40 broad, and by Pliny, to have I cen 16 M. P.

it and 6 M. P. broad (r. 15). It was traversed

a direction NW. and SE. by the river Jordan.

oKDaXn: Palakstina.] This sea is known

many different names in the Bible and profane

tcf*. Ita eurliest title would seem to have been

.:/Trth (.VfimA. xxxiv. 11; Joth. xiii 27; LXX

'rrtpii.) From this fonn has pn>bably arisen

kohu! appellation of Gennesareth Mfjon) Tfi'-

*,urq YtwtoapiTti, Joseph. Ant. xviii. 3; Strab.  
i. p. 755; Genasara, Plin. v. 15.) A third

ilaiioa it has derived from the province with

m!i it was most nearly connected, viz. the sea of

ihlee (MAsiTira ttji raAiAaiar, Mattk. iv. 18;

ort, vil 31, 4c.; and with a double title, SdAewa

rijs TaAiAaiar, TTjr Ti&pIaSos, John vi. 1). Pliny,

in describing the same localities, speaks of a town

called Taricliaea, from whence also he says the

adjoining lake was sometimes named (I. c; cf.

also Strab. xvi. p. 764). The present name is

Bakr-al-Tabarieh. (Pococke, ii. p. 103; Thevenot

p. 387; Hoselquist, i. p. 181; Kobinson, iii. pp. 499

—509, &c) [V.]

TIBEItlO'POLIS (TieVpiowroAis), a town in

Phrygia Major, in the neighbourhood of Eumenia.

(PtoL v. 2. § 25; Socrat. Hut. Eccla. vii. 46.)

Its site is yet uncertain, but Kiepert (in Franz,

Funf Intchrij'ten, p. 33) is disposed to regard the

extensive ruins near Suleiman as the remnants of

Tiberiopolis. Hamilton (Retearchu, i. p. 127, foil.),

probably more correctly, regards them as the ruins

of lilaundos. (Comp. Aruudell, Ditcottriri, i. p.

81, foil.) [L. S.]

Ti'BERIS (o Tiff pit: Term, Tiber : the forms

Tibris, Tybris, and Thybris are chiefly poetical, as

is QvuSpts also in Greek: the Latin poets use also

Tiberinus as an adjective form, as Tiberinus pater,

Tiberinum fluinen, &c, and thence sometimes Ti­

berinus by itself as the name of the river), one of

the most important rivers of Central Italy. It has

its sources in the Apennines above Tifemum, hut in

the territory of Arretium (Plin. iii. 5. s. 9), on the

confines of Etruria and Umbria, and flows at first in

a southerly direction, passing by the walls of Tifer-

num. which derived from it the name of Tiberinum

(Citta iii CastiUd),am\ afterwards within a few miles

of Perusia on the E.,and within a still shorter distance

to the W. of Tuder ( 7Wi). From thence it still pre­

serves a general S. direction, notwithstanding consi­

derable windings, till it receives the waters of the

Anio (Tertrone), a few miles from the walls of

Rome, from which point it has a general SW. course

to the sea at Ostia. Pliny estimates the upper part

of its course at 150 miles, to which must be added

about 35 more for the lower part, giving as a total

185 miles ( Plin. /. c ; Strab. v. p. 218); but this es­

timate is below the truth, the whole course of the

river being about 180 geogr. or 225 Roman miles.

During the whole of its course from Tifemum to the

s«i the Tiber formed in ancient times the eastern

boundary of Etruria, separating that country from

Umbria in the upper |>art of its course, afterwards

from the territory of the Sabines, and, in the lower

part, from the mouth of the Anio downwards, divid­

ing it from Latium. (Strab. T. p. 219; Plin. /.<-.)

It receives numerous confluents or tributaries, of

which the most important are, the Tixia, an incon­

siderable stream which joins it from the E. a little

below Perusia, bringing with it the waters of the

more celebrated Ciitumnus; the Clanis, which

falls into it from the right bank, descending from the

marshy tract near Clusium; tho Nab, a much

more considerable stream, which is joined by the

Veijnus a few miles above Interamna. and dis­

charges their combined waters into the Tiber, a few

miles above Ocriculum; and the Anio, which falls

into the Tilier at Antetnnae, 3 miles above Rome.

These are the only affluents of the Tiber of any geo­

graphical importance, but among its minor tributa­

ries, the Allia on its left bank, a few miles above

the Anio, and the Ckk.mf.ua on the rinht, are names

of historical celebrity, though very trifling streams,

the identification of which is by no means certain.

[See the respective articles.] Two other streams of

less note, which descend from the land of the Sabine*

and fall into the Tiber between Ocriculum and Ere­
