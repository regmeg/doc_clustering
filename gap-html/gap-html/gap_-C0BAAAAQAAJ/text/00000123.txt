Hkueskth and Kir-Heres. (Am. xvi. 7, 11; Jer.

xlviii. 31.) In the Chaldce version and the Greek of

the Apocrypha, it appears in the form of Kcrakka-

3Iijab.and Characa (X<f,»aica,2 Mace. xii. 17). Under

this latter name, more or less corrupted, it is men­

tioned by Ptolemy (XapeUaj/ia, v. 17. § 5: comp.

XonMuiSi, Steph. B.) and other writers, both ecclc-

fU-lical and profane, down to the centuries before

the Crusade*. (Alm-1-l'cMa, Tab. Syr. p. 89; Schul-

tens, IruJex arl Vit. Salad, s. p.) The Crusaders

found the name extant, and erected the fortress still

known as Kerak, which, with that of Shobek, formed

the- centre of operations for the Latins E. of the

Jordan. With the capture of these, after a long

siege by Saladin, A. v. 1188, the dominion of the

Franks over this territory terminated. (Wilken, die

Krmz, voL iv. pp. 244—247.) The whole of this

district was unknown till A. t>. 1806, when Seetzen

(Zachs, Monad. Corr. xviii. pp.433, foil.) penetrated

a.- far as Ktrak. A fuller account of the place is

given by Burckhardt (Trav. pp. 379—387), by

whom it was next visited in 1812; and another

description is furnished by Irby and Mangles

(Trac. pp. 301—370), who followed in the same

direction in 1818. (Robinson, Bibl. !{<■*■ vol. ii. pp.

Labeatae. (Plin. iii. 26.) It is now called the lake

of Scutari, famous for the quantity of fish, especially

of the *' Cyprinoa" family. The rivers, which drain

the rocky district of Mnnte-Xegro, discharge them­

selves into this lake, which communicates with the

•19,iv.45) LAVl'CI, (to AagucoV: Klh. AaSixaKis,

Labicanas and Ijivicanus: A^r Coltwui), an ancient

c:-.t of Lutium, situated at the foot of the north-

r.i>tem slope of the Alban hills, and distant about

15 miles from Rome. Its foundation was ascribed,

according to a tradition reported by Scrvius (ad

An. vii. 796), to Glaucus, a son of Minos: and

Virgil (I c.) mentions it among the cities which

tm assistance to king Latinus against Aeneas, so

thst be must have regarded it as more ancient than

the Trojan settlement in Latium. But the cur­

rent tradition, adopted by Dionysius, represented

Lahtcuni, in common with so many other I^atin

rities.i as a colony of Alba. (Dionvs. viii. 19;

Dmlor. op. F.uteb. Arm. p. 185.) Whatever was

Tt» origin, we know with certainty that it was one

of the cities of the Latin League, and as such

retained, down to n late period, the right of par­

ticipating in the sacrifices on the Alban Mount.

(Dionvs. v. 61; Cic. jrroPlanc.9.) It first appears

in history as taking part in the league of the Latins

against Romo previous to the battle of Regillus

(Dionvs. I. c), and is afterwards mentioned among

the cities which are represented as taken in suc­

cession by Coriolanus, during his campaign against

the Romans. (Liv. ii. 39; Dionvs. viii. 19.) It is

not improbable that this legend represents the his­

torical fact that Labicum, together with Bola,

Pedum, and other places which figure in the same

narrative, actually fell about that time into the

hands of the Aequians, as Satricum, Corioli, and

other towns further to the S., did into those of the

Volscians. (Niebuhr, vol. ii. p. 259.) But during

the subsequent wars of the Romans with tho

Aequians, Labicum always appears as a Latin

city: and from its position on the frontier of La­

tium adjoining the Aequians, its name repeatedly

occurs in the history of those contests. Thus, in

B. c. 458, its territory was ravaged by the Acquinn

general Gracchus: and in 418 we find the Labicans

themselves abandoning the Roman alliance, and

joining the Aequians, together with whom they

established a camp on Mount Algidus. Their com­

bined forces were, however, defeated by the Roman

dictator Q. Servilius Priscus, and Labicum itself

was taken by storm. In order to secure their new

conquest against the Aequians the Hornan senate

sent thither a colony of 1500 Roman citizens, which

appears to have maintained itself there, thongh at­

tacked the very next year by the Aequians. (Liv. iii.

25, iv. 45—47, 49.) In n. c. 383, its territory

was again ravaged by the Praenestincs, at that time

on hostile terms with Rome (Liv. vi. 21); and after

a long interval, in B. c. 211, it once more sustained

the same fate from the army of Hannibal. (Liv.

xxvi. 9.)

From this time the name of Labicum disapjiears

from history, but we learn that it still existed as a

municipiuin, though in a very poor and decayed

condition, in the days of Cirero. (Cic. pro fltnic.

9, de Ltg. Ayr. ii. 35.) Strabo, however, speaks

of the town as in ruins, and Pliny mentions the

population "ex agro Labicano" in a manner that

secins to imply that, though they still formed a

"populus" or community, the city no longer existed.

(Strnb. v. pp. 230, 237; Plin. iii. 5. b. 9.) In like

manner we find the "ager Labicanus" elsewhere

mentioned, but no further notice of the town. (Suet.

Cats. 83.) The inhabitants teem to have, under

the Roman empire, congregated together afresh in

the neighbourhood of the station on the Via La-

bicana, called Ad Quintanas, and hence assumed

the name of Lavicani QuintanenseS, which we meet

with in inscriptions. (Orell.Aiwcr. 118, 3997.) The

territory appears to have been one of great fertility,

and was noted for the excellence of its grapes. (Sil.

Ital. viii. 366; Jul. Capit. Clud. Allnti. II.)

The position of Labicum has been a subject of

much dispute, having been placed by different

writers at Vulinontone, Zagarolu, and Lutjnano.

But the precise statement of Strabo (v. p. 237) as

to the course of the Via Lalmnnn, together with the

fact that he describes the ancient city as situated

on a hill to the right of that road, about 120 stadia

(15 Roman miles) from Rome, ought to have left no

difficulty on the subject: and Holstcniiis long ago

correctly placed the ancient city on the hill now
