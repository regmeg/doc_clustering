VICUS CUMIXA'RIUS, a place of the Carpetani

VICUS DOLUCEXSIS, in Gallia. The name

occurs only on an inscription found at Halinghen,

near Boulogne, the ancient Gesoriacum ("Gkso-

iciACt'si]. Vicus Dolucensis may be tlie old name

of Halinghen. (Ulcert, Gallien.) [G. L.]

VICUS HE'LENAE, in Gallia, mentioned by

Sidonius Apollinaris {Major. Carrn. 5.216), in the

country of the Atrebates; but geographers disagree

about the site. Some place it at Uedin or Ilesdtn,

on the Canche, but tliat river is in the country of

the Moiini. Others fix it at a place called Lent, and

others in other places. (I'kert, (lallien.) [G. L.J

VICUS ICT1MULOKUM. [IcriMULi.]

VICUS JULI1 or ATURES, in Aqaitania. The

name Civitas Aturensium occurs in the Notitia of the

Gallic Provinces. The name Atures also occurs in

Sidonius Apollinaris (ii. ep. I). In the passage of

Tibullus, cited under ATUKUS [Vol. I. p. 336]

** Atur ' is said to be a correction of Scaliger, the  
MSS. having Atax : —

uQuem tremeret forti milite rictus Atur;"

but the great critic is probably right.

At the council of Agile (Agatha), a. r>. 506,

there is a subscription by a bishop "de civitate

Vico Juli," and the same name occurs in Gregory of

Tours. D'Anville affirms that Atures and Vicus

Julii are tlie same plate, relying on a Notice, where

we read "Civitas Adtorensium Vico Juli." The

name of the river Atur was also given to a people

Atures, who have given their name to the town of

Aire, which is on the Adour. (D'Anville, No­

tice, Or.) [G. I..]

VICUS JULIUS, in Gallia, is mentioned only in

the Notitia of the Empire as a post under the orders

of the general residing at Mogontiacum (Mainz).

It is placed between Tubernae (Rhein-Zaberri) and

Neutetes (Speier). D'Anville supposes Vicus Julius

to be (iermertheinif at the place where the Queiek

enters the Rhine. [G, L.J

V1DUBIA or VIDUBIO, in Gallia, appears in

the Table on a road from Andematunum (Longres)

to Cabillio, which is Cabillonum {Ck&lon sttr-Sadne).

The road passes through File or Tile [Tile] to Vi-
