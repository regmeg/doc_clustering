in their sides. The ruins of Talmis are of surpassing

interest, and comparatively in good preservation,

probably because, being excavated in the sandstone,

they escaped mutilation or destruction by the Per­

sians. The principal structure was a rock-temple

ut the foot ot the hills, dedicated, as appears both

from a hieroglyphieal and a Greek inscription, to a

deity named Mandulis or Mululis, a son of Isis. His

mythical history is exhibited on bas-reliefs. But the

sculptures at Talmis are of the highest interest, both

a.-i works of art and as historical monuments. Their

execution is the work of various ages: some, as ap­

pears by their rude forms, ascending to a remote an­

tiquity, others, as those in the temple of Mandulis,

being of the be->t days of Aegyptian art. The temple

was (bunded by Amunoph II., was rebuilt by one of the

Ptolemies, and repaired in the reigns of the Caesars,

Augustus, Caligula, and Trajan. The subjects of

these sculptures represent partly the triumphs of

the Pharaohs, and partly the tributes exacted by

them from the conquered. On one wall is the

warrior in his chariot putting to flight bearded men

in short garments, armed with bows and arrows,

and a sickle-shaped knife or sword. In another

compartment the conqueror is in the act of putting

Ids captives to death. Another represents the booty

obtained after a victory, and, besides the captives,

exhibits the spoils taken, e. g. lion-headed and lion-

clawed chairs, knives, loaves, sandals, skins of

animals, &c. These sculptures illustrate also the

natural history uf S. Aethiopia. They contain figures

of lions, antelopes, and bulls, greyhounds, giraffes,

ostriches and monkeys. The giraffes and ostriches

point clearly to a country south of the utmost limit

of Aegyptian dominion, and seem to indicate wars

with the Garamantes and the kingdom of Borneo.

Herodotus (iii. 97) mentions ebony wood among the

articles of tribute which every three years Aethiopia

ottered to the Persian king. Ebony as well as ivory,

a product of the interior of Libya, appears on the

walls of the temple of Mandulis. A coloured fac­

simile of these bculptures is displayed in one of the

rooms of the British Museum. At a short distance

from Talmis stood another temple of scarcely interior

interest, and the space between is covered with heaps

of earth and fragments of pottery, mixed with human

bones and bandages that have been steeped in bitu­

men— the evident traces of a large necropolis. At

Talmis lias been also discovered an inscription in

the Greek language, supposed to be of the age of

Diocletian, in which Silco, king of Aethiopia and

Nubia, commemorates his victories over the lSIein-

myes. The wealth of Talmis, apparent in its

sculptures, was doubtle-s in great measure owing

lo hs |>osition as a commercial station between

Aegypt and Aethiopia, but partly also to the emerald

mines in its neighbourhood. In the fifth century a.p.,

the town and its neighbourhood were occupied by

the Blemmyes, who had a regular government, since

they had chiefs of tribes (tpuAdpx01) and were cele­

brated fur their skill in divination. (Olympiodor. ap.
