111S TEGEA TECMON.

(ii. 11. § 27) in the north of Germany, perhaps in

the country of the Chauci, on the left bank of the

Visurgis (Weser). Its bite must probably be

looked for near or at the village of Zttel, about 3

miles from the western bank of the Weser. (Reichard,

Gernianien} p. 245.) [L. S.]

TECMON (TfKfiatv: Eth. TtKH&vios), a city of

Molossis in Epeirus, incorrectly called by Stephanos

B. a city of Thesprot'ia, taken by L. Anicius, the

Koinan commander, in d. c. 167. Leake supposes

that Guridntita, near Kurertdo, about 20 miles to

tbe \\". of Jodnnina, may have been the bite of Tec-

mon or Horreum, which Livy mentions in connection

with Tecmon. (Liv. xlv. 26; Steph. B. s. v.; Leake,

Northern Grace, vol. iv. p. 83.)

TECTOSACES (TeKTwcwcey, Ptol. vi. 14. § 9),

a people of Scythia within Imaus. [T. 11. D.]

TECTOSAGES. [Volcae.]

TECTOSAGKS, TECTOSAGAE, or TECTO-

SAGI (TfKTufraycs, TtKTOffdyai), one of the three

great tribes of the Celts or Gallograeci in Asia

Minor, of which they occupied the central parts.

Tor particulars about their history, see Galatia.

Tliese Tectosages were probably the same tribe as

the one meutiuned by Polybius under the names of

Ae^osages or Iligosages. (Polyb. v. o.'i. 77, "St

111.) [L.S.]

TECUM. [Tkjiiis.]

TEDA'XIUS (T-nodvws), a small river of Illy -

rieum (Ptol. ii. 16. § 3), on the frontier of the

district called Iapydia (Plin. iii. 25), is in all pro­

bability tlie. modern Zermanja. [1.. S.]

TE'G E A (Teyca, Steph. 1J.jr. tJ.), a town of Crete,

which, according to legend, was founded by Aga­

memnon. (Veil. Pat. i. 1.) The coins which Sestini

and Pellenn attributed to the Cretan Tegea have

been restored by Eckhel (vol. ii. p. 321) to the

Arcadian city of that name. [E. B. J.]

TEGEA (Tty4a, Ion. Tc-y^; Eth. TeytirTjs,

Tegeata). one of the most ancient and pow< rful towns

of Arcadia, situated in the SE. of the country. Its

territory, called Tegeatts (T^earis), was bounded

by Cynuria and Argolts on the E., from which it

was separated by Mt. Parthenium, by Laconia on

the S-, by the Arcadian district of Maenalia on the

\Y., and by the territory of Mantineia on the X.

The Tegeatae are said to have derived their name

from Tegeates, a son of Lycaon, and to have dwelt

originally in eight, afterwards nine, denii or town­

ship-, the inhabitants of which were incorporated

by Aieus in the city of Tegea, of which this hero

was the reputed founder. The names of these nine

townships, which are preserved by Paiisanias. are;

Gareatae (TcuJfaTcu). Phylaccis (^fAaKtis), Cary-

Ct'ne (Kopyarai}, Corytheii (Kopv6t7s)t Poiachidae

(n&.*Tax'5«i)t Oedtae (OmTai), Manthyrcis (Mcw-

tivpels), Echeuetheu ('Ex*f?')0fs), to which Aphei-

dtintes ('A<pti5aiT(j) was added as the ninth in the

reign of king Apheidas. (Paus. viii. 3. $ 4, viii. 45.

§ 1; Strab. viii. p. 337.) The Tegeatae were early-

divided into 4 tribes ((f>u\ai), called respectively

ClareOtis (KActpfi-ns, in inscriptions Kpaptu-ris),

llippothoitis (TirTrotfnr-m). Apol oneat'ts ("AtoAAw-

y<uns), and Athaneatis ('Attar*Tins), to each of

which belonged a certain number of metoeci (ju«-

Toiifc?i) or resident aliens. (Paus. viii. 53. § 6;

BuYkh, Corp. laser, no. 1513.)

Tegea is mentioned in the Iliad (ii. 607). and

was probably the most celebrated <f all the Arca­

dian towns in the earliest times. This appears from

its heroic renown, since its king Echemus is said

to have slain Hyllus, the son of HerrwK. is

combat. (Herod, ix. 26; Paus. tul 45. § \) Tar

Tegeatae offered a long-continued ud sarre»-

ful resistance to the Spartans, wiitn tae Lv t-

tempted to extend their dominion we Ansu.

Soon after the battle of Plataea, tbe Tc«

Athena Alea in the city, was a freq-neai
