SCOTI. The Scoti were tbe ancient inhabitants

of Hibemia, as appears from notices in some of the

Latin writers. (Claudian, delV. Cons. Honor. 33,

de Laud. StiL ii. 251; Oroa. i. 2.) For several

centuries Ireland was considered as the land of the

Scoti, and the name of Scotia was equivalent to that

of Hibernia. (Isid. Orig. xiv. 6; Beda, i. 1, ii. 4;

Gcogr. Rav. i. 3, v. 32; Alfred the Great, up. Oros.

p. 30, &c.) We have no accounts respecting tbe

subdivisions of the Scoti; but perhaps they are to

be sought in the names of the Irish counties, as

A/nutter, Leinster, Ulster, Comtaught. Ammianus

mentions the Scoti, in conjunction with the Atta-

cotti, as committing formidable devastations (xxvii.

8. § 4). According to St Jerome (ooV. Jovin.

v. 2. 201, ed. Mart.) they had their wives in

common; a custom which Dion Cassius represents as

also prevailing among the kindred race in Caledonia

(Ixxvi. 12). At a later period the names of Scotia

and Scoti vanish entirely from Ireland, and become

the appellations of the neighbouring Caledonia and

its inhabitants. This was effected through a mi­

gration of the Scoti into Caledonia, who settled to

the N. of the Clyde; but at what lime this hap-

pened, cannot be ascertained. Beda (i. 1) states

that it took place under a leader called Reuda. The

new settlement waged war with the surrounding

Picts, and even against the Anglo-Saxons, but at

first with little success. (Id. i. 24, iv. 36.) Ul­

timately, however, in the year 839, under king

Keneth, they succeeded in subduing the Picts

(Fordun, Scot. Hist. ap. Gale, i. 659, seq.); and the

whole country N. of Solway Frith subsequently

obtained the name of Scotland. (Comp. 'Zeuss, Die

Deutschen u. die Nachbarstumme, p. 568; Gibbon,

vol. iii. p. 268, and notes, ed. Smith.) [T. H.D.]

SCOTUSSA (Peat. Tab.; Scotusa, Plin. iv. 17. s.

18: Eth. Scotussaei, Plin. iv. 17. s. 18), a station on

the road from Heracleia Sintica to Philippi, which

passed round the N. of the lake Cercinites, answering

to the place where the Strymon was crossed just

above tho lake. (Leake, Northern Greece, vol. iii.

p. 227.) [E.B.J.]

SCOTUSSA (SicoToSirffa or Zxorowra: Eth.

XKOTOveaaios), an ancient town of Pelasgiotis in

Thessaly, lying between Pherae and Pharsalus, near

the frontiers of Phthiotis. Scotussa is not men­

tioned in Homer, but according to some accounts

the oracle of Doduna in Epeirus originally came

from this place. (Strab. vii. p. 329.) In n. c. 394

the Scotussaei joined the other Thessalians in op­

posing the march of Agesilaus through their country.

(Xen. Hell. iv. 3. § 3.) In u. c. 367 Scotnssa was

treacherously seized by Alexander, tyrant of the

neighbouring town of Pherae. (Diod. xv. 75.) In

the territory of Scotussa were the hills called

Cynoscepbalae, which are memorable as the scene of

two battles, one fought in B. c. 364, between the

Thebans and Alexander of Pherae, in which Pe-

lopidas was slain, and the other, of still greater

celebrity, fought in B.C. 197, in which the last

Philip of Macedonia was defeated by the Roman

consul Flamininus. (Plut. Pelop. 32; Strab. ix. p.

441; Polyb. xviii. 3, seq.; Liv. xxxiii. 6, seq.) In

B. c 191 Scotussa surrendered to Antiochus, but

was recovered shortly afterwards, along with l'hai-

salus and Pherae, by the consul Acilius. (Lir.

xxxvi. 9, 14.) The ruins of Scotussa are found at

3 o 3
