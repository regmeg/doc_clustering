the opinion of Eratosthenes (Strak i. p. 64). The

Indian Ocean contains at its eastern end three prin­

cipal gulfs, which are noticed in ancient authors,—

the Sinus pRKiaaucts (Ptol. vii. 2. § 5), in tlic

Chersonesus Aurea (probably now the Straits of

Malacca); the Sisi'sSabauacl's (Ptol. vii. 2. §4),

now the Gulf of Mai'taban; and the Stars Gan-

gkticts, or Bay of Bengal. [V.]

INDIGETES, or INDI'GETAK, (T^i/op-cn,

Strab.; 'EKSrytrai, Ptol.), a people of Hispauia

Tarraeonensis, in the extreme NE. corner of the

peninsula, around the gulf of Uhodn and Kinporme

(Gulf of Ain/mrias), as far as the Trophies of

Pompey (ra nojumjtou rpAwata, ayaOrjuara tow

nuMW»,ioi/), on the .summit of the pass wer the

Pyrenees, which formed tho boundary of Gaul

and Spain (Strab. iii. p. 160, iv. p. 17H). [Pom-

pkii Tropaka.] They were divided into four

tribes. Their chief cities, besides Kmi'oiuae and

IEiioua, were: Jitkcakia (Toiryyapta, Ptol. ii. 6.

§ 73 * JtmaverOy or, as some suppose, Figueras),

16 M P. south of the summit of the Pyrenees (Sum-

mum Pyrenaeum, Itin.)t on the high road to Tarrsco

(/tin. Ant. pp.390, 397); Cinsiama (Cervia), 15

M. P. further S. (/ft.; Tab. Pent.); and Decia.na,

near Junquera (PtoL ii. 6. § 73). On the promontory

farmed by the E. extremity of the Pyrenees (C.Creus),

was a temple of Venus, with a small sea[K>rt on the N.

side ('AtppoSiffiat, Steph. B. ; to 'AQpoilfftov i*p6r,

Ptol. ii. 6. § 20; Pyrenaea Venus, Plin. iii. 3. s. 4;

Port us Veneris, Mela, ii. 6. § 5; Port us Pyrenaei,

Liv. xxxiv. 8 : Porte Vendres), which some made

the boundary of Gaul and Spain, instead of the

Trophies of Pompey. Ptolemy names two small

rivers as falling into the gulf of Emporiae, the

Ci-oniAXi's (KAutfaavis: Fluvia) and the Sam-

bkocah (2a+i€p6na lic$o\ai): Pliny names the

Tichik, which is the small river flowing past Rosas.

The district round the gulf of Emporiae was called

Jlucarius Cami'I'.s (to 'lovyydpioy ircou/*), from

the abundance of rushes which grew upon iu marshy

soil. (Strab. iii. pp. 156, 163; Steph. I). «. r.'LV8t-

INDOSCY'TUIA (Trtoo-jrvfta: Eth. IvSo-

atcv&rjs), a district of wide extent alone the Indus,

which probably comprehended the whole tract

watered by the Lower Indus, Cutch, Guzerat, and

Saurashtran. It derived its name from the Scythian

tribes, who gradually preyed onwards to the south

and the sea-coast after they had overthrown the

Graeco-Bactrian empire, about A. I>. 136. It is

first mentioned in the Peri pi us M. E. (p. 22) as occu­

pying the banks of the Indus; while in Ptolemy is a

fuller description, with the names of some of its

principal subdivisions, as Pattalene, Abiria, and

Svrattrene (Saurashtran), with an extensive list of

town* which belonged to it (vii. 1. §§ 55—61).

Sxne of them, as Binagara (properly Minnagara),

have been recognised as partially Scythic in form,

(lessen. Pentap. p. 56; cf. Isidnr. Char. p. 9.) In

DionvMUH Periegetes (r. 1088) the same people are

tli-M-ribed as potum Sxvfat, As late as the middle of

tli«- sixth centory A.n.. Cosmas Indicoplcustes speaks

of White Huns, or Mongolians, as the inhabitants of

the I'anjab (ii. p. 338). These may be considered

as the remains of the same Scythic empire, the pre-

derrvtre of the hordes who subsequently poured

ilmn from the north under Jinghfi Khan. (Hitter,

Krdhmde, vol. i. p. 558.) [V.]

INDUS (o TrWf), one of the principal riven of

Asia, and the boundary westward of India. !t is

mentioned first in ancient authors by Ilccataeus of

Miletus (Fragtn. 144, ed. Klauscn). and *u^**-

oucntly by Herodotus (iv. 44), who, however, only

notices it in connection with various tribes who, he

states, lived tijion its banks. As in tlte ca>e of

India itself, ho in that of the Indus, the first real

description which the ancients obtained of this river

was from the historians of Alexander the Great's

marches. Arrian states that its sources were in tb#

lower spurs of the Paropamisus, or Indian CaDcasu*

(Hindu-K ash); wherein he agrees with Mela (iii. 7.

§ 6), Stralw (xv. p. 690). Curtius (viii. 9. § 3), and

otlier writers. It was, in Arrian s opinion, a vast

stream, even from its first sources, the largest river

in the world except the Ganges, and the recipient

of many tributaries, themselves larger than any <>t In r

known stream. It has been conjectured, from the

descriptions of the Indus which A man has preserved,

that the writers from whom he has condensed his

narrative must have seen it at the time when its

waters were at their highest, in August and Sep­

tember. Quoting fromCtesias (v. 4,11), and with the

authority of the other writers (v. 20), Arrian gives

40 stadia for the mean breadth of the river, and 15

stadia where it was most contracted; below the con­

fluence of the principal tiibutaries he considers its

breadth may be 100 stadia, and even more than this

when much flooded (vi. 14). Pliny, on the otlier

hand, considers that it is nowhere more than SO

stadia broad (vi. 20. s. 23), which is clearly the

same opinion as that of Strabo, who states, that

though thoMj wfco hud not measured the breadth pat

it down at 100 stadia, those, on the other hand, wba

had measured it, asserted that 50 stadia was its

greatest, and 7 stadia its least breadth (xv. p. 70O).

Its depth, according to Pliny (J. c.)» was nowhere

less than 15 fathoms. According to Diodorns, it was

the greatest river in the world after the Nile (ii. 35^

Curtius states that its waters were cold, and of tl*

colour of the sea (viii. 9. § 4). Its current is held by

some to have been slow (as by Mela, iii. 7- § 6); by

others, rapid (as by Eustath. in Dionus. Perieg. r.

1088). Its course towards the sea, after leaving tii«

mountains, was nearly S\V. (Plin. vi. 20. s. 23); os

its way it received, according to Strabo (xv. p. 70O)

and Arrian (v. 6), 15, according to Pliny, 19

other tributary riven (I.e.). About 2000 stadia

from the Indian Ocean, it was divided into two

principal arms (Strab. xv. p. 701), forming thereby

a Delta, like that of the Nile, though not so Urge,

called Pattalene, from its chief town Pattala (whka

Arrian asserts meant, in the Indian tongue. Delta

(v. 4); though this statement may be questioned \

from high mountain-ranges with a rapid stream, b

ever clianging: hence, probably, the different ac­

counts which we receive of the mouths of the Indus

from those who recorded the history of Alcxandet,

and from the works of later geographers. The

former (as we have stated), with Sirs bo, gave th*

Indus only two principal outlets iuto the Iiulun

Ocean, — at a distance, the one from the other, ac­

cording to Aristobalus (ap. Strab. xv. p. 690), of

1000 stadia, but, according to Nearchus (L c). of

1800 stadia. The latter mention more than two

mouths: Mela (iii. 7. § 6) speaking of "pJura

out is," and Ptolemy giving the names of seven (riL

1. § 28), in which he is confirmed by the author of

the PerijHUt ilaiu Erythraei (p. 22). The naa.es
