TACAril

(p. f>89) distinctly enumerates it anions the Carian

towns. Davai m a large and well-built town, and

the capital of a considerable district; the governor's

residence stands on a height overlooking the town,

anil commanding a most magnificent view*. (Kichter,

U'allfahrten, p. .043; Kranz, Funf Inschriften, p.

30.)

It should he observed that Pliny (v. 27) mentions

another town in I'ilicia of the name of Tabae, of

which, however, nothing is known. [L. S.]

COIN OK TAnAE.

TARALA (Trf&zAa), a town of F.ydia near the

river Hermus, is known only from coins found in

the country; but it is no doubt the same :is the one

mentioned by Hierocles (p. 670) under the name of

Gabala, which is perbapi only miawritten for Tabala.

It is even possible that it may be the town of Tabae

which Stcphanus ftyz. assigns to Lydia. Some trace

of the ancient place seems to be preserved in the

name of the village Tonbaili on the left bank of the

Hermus. between Adtda and Kutn. [L. S.]

TAIiANA (T&Sava, Ptol. i»i. 6. § 6), a place in

the interior of the Chersonesus Taurica. [T.H.D.]

TABASS1 (Titmffm, Ptol. ril 1. § 85), a tril*

of Indians who oenpied the interior of the southern

p ut of //wWo.*f<tn, in the neighbourhood of the

present province of Mysore. Their exact position

cannot l>e determined, but they were not far distant

from M. Ihttiffo, the most S. of the U\ Ght'its.

They derived their name from the Sanscrit Tapnsjn,

"woods."(LasMO, hid. AltertJi. vol. i. p. 243.) [V.]

TABERNAE, in Gallia, is placed by tlie Itinera­

ries U'twecn Xoviomagos (.S/*e«r) and Saletio(Se//i).

The position of Tal>crnae is supposed to correspond

t>> that of lihehtznbern. Tabernae is mentioned by

Amtnianns Marcellinus (xvi. 2), unless in this paa-

sairc lie means another place (No. 2) which has the

wiine name.

2. Between Argentoratum (Stra&shurg) and Divo-

duruni (Metz) is EUatz-Zab<m, or Snvetme. as the

Trench call it, which is about 21 miles from Strtiss-

hurg. This seems to Ik? the place which Ammianus

(xvi. 11) calls Tres Tal>ernae. When .Julian was

marching against the Alemanni, who were eiicamjM'd

near Argcntoratum, be rejaired Tres Tabernae, for

the purpose of preventing the Germans from entering

Gallia by this pass in the Vosgts. Ammianus (xvi.

12) also gives the distance from Tres Taliernae to

the German camp at Argentoratutn at 14 " leugae,**

which is 21 Roman miles, and agrees very well with

the distance between Saverrie and Strassbury (D'An-

ville, Xoiice. tf-c.).

3. Tabernae is mentioned by Ausonius (Moselta,

v. 8) on the road between llingium (/iingeti) and

Noviomagus (X<nmagen); but the geographers are

not agreed alwut the position, whether it is Bergza-

6em, a place which is out of the way, BaUlenau, or

JUnicaslel on the Motel. Ausonius says there is

a spring there :—

"Praetereo arentem sitientibus undique terris

Duinnissum riguasque i«erenni fonte Tal>ernas."
