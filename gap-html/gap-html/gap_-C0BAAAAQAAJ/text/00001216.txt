1130 TERGKSTE.

TEK1XA.

w;is very near the confines of 1stria and Veneftia, so

that there is considerable discrepancy between an­

cient authors as to which of these provinces it he-

longed, both Strata and Ptolemy reckoning it a

city of 1st ria, while Pliny includes it in the region

of the Carni, which was comprised in Veuctia.

(Strab. v. p. 215, vii. p. 314; l'lin. iii. 18. s. 22;

Ptol. iii. |. § 27.) Mela on the contrary calls it the

boundary of Illyricum (ii. 4. § 3). From the

time that the Formio, a river which falls into tbeaea

6 miles S. of Trieste, became fixed as the boundary

of the province! [Kokmio], there can bo no doubt

that Pliny's attribution is correct. It is probable

that Tergeste was originally a native town either of

the Carni or Islrians, but no mention is found of its

name till after the Roman conquest, nor does it

appear to have risen into a place of importance until

a later jvriod. The first historical mention of it is

in it. c. 51, when we learn that it was taken and

plundered by a sudden incursion of the neighbour­

ing barbarians (Cues. Ii. G. viii. 24; Appian, I Ityr.

IS); but frotn the terms iu which it is there no­

ticed it is evident that it was already a Roman

town, and apparently had already received a Roman

colony. It was afterwards restored, and, to protect

it for the future against similar disasters, was forti­

fied with a wall and towers by Octarian in B. c. 32.

(Grutcr, Inter, p. 2tih\ 6.) It is certain that it

enjoyed the rank of a Colonia from the time of Au­

gustus, and is styled such both by Pliny and Ptolemy.

(Plin. iii. 18. s. 22; I'tol. iii. I. § 27.) That em­

peror also placed under the protection and authority

of (he city the neigh bourinij barbarian tribes of the

Carni and Catali, and, by reducing to subjection

their more formidable neighbours, the lajtodes, laid

the foundations of the prosperity of Terge.ste. The

growth of this was mainly promoted by the advan­

tages of its jxirt, which is tin; only good harbour in

this part of the Adriatic; hut it was apparently over­

shadowed by the greatness of the neighbouring

Aqnileta, and Tergeste, though a considerable mu­

nicipal town, never ro>e iu ancient times to a com­

manding position. We even learn that in the reign

ot Antoninus Pius the citizens obtained the admis-

sion of the Carni and Catali—who had previously

been mere subjects or dependents—to the Roman

"civitas," iu order that they might share the burthen-

some honours of the local magistracy. (OrelI. /titer.

4040.) The inscription from which we learn this

fact is one of the most interesting municipal records

preserved to us from ancient times, and has l>ecu

repeatedly published, especially with notes and il­

lustrations by C. T. Zumpt (Decrehm Municipal*:

Tergettimmn, 4to. Berol. 1837) and by Guttling

(Fitnfzt hn Huinhche Vrhtmkn, p. 75). No subse­

quent mention of Tergeste is found in history under

the Roman Empire; but it is certain that it conti­

nued to exist; and retained its position as a consi­

derable town throughout the middle ages. liut it is

only within the last century that it lias risen to the

position that it now occupies of one of the most po­

pulous and flourishing cities on the Adriatic. The

only remains of antiquity extant at Trieste are some

portions of a Roman temple, built into the modern

cathedral, together with several inscriptions (in­

cluding the celebrated one already noticed) and some

tragments of friezes, bas-reliefs, &c.

lergeste is placed by the Itineraries at a distance

of 24 miles from AquileU, on the line of road which

followed the coast from that citv into lstria. Utin.
