1124 TEMISDIA.

TEMPE.

v. 15, 16.) Its name is afterwards found in all the

geographers, as well as in the Tabula, so that it

must have subsisted a-* a town throughout the Ro­

man Kmpire. (Strub. I.e.; Plin. iii. 5. s. 10; Pto!.

in. 1. § 9; Tab. Pent.) Pausanias expressly tells

us it was still inhabited in his day; and Pliny also

notices it for the excellence of its wine. (Pans. vi.

6 § 10; Plin. xiv. 6. s. 8.) The period of its de­

struction is unknown; but after the fall of the

Roman Empire the name wholly disappears, and

its exact site has never been determined. The be*t

clue is that afforded by the Tabula (winch accords

well with the statements of Pliny and Strabo),

that it was situated 10 miles S. of Clampetia. If

this last town be correctly placed at Amantea

[Clampetia], the site of Tempsa must be looked

for on the coast near the Torre cUl Piano del Ciuale,

about 2 miles S. of the river Savuto, and 3 from

AWcttj. Unfortunately none of the towns along

thi> hue of coast can he fixed with anything like

cert.iinty. (Cluver. Italy. 1286; Romanelli, vol. i.

P 35.)'

Xear lemesa was a sacred prove, with a shrine

or sanctuary of the hero Polites, one of the com-

panion* of Ulysses, who was said to have been slain

on the spot, and bis s|*ctre continued to trouble the

inhabitant.*, until :tt length Euthymus, the celebrated

Locriuii athlete, ventured to wrestle with the spirit,

and having vanquished it, freed the city from all

further molestation. (Strab. vi. p. 255; Paus.vi. 6.

gs; 7 — U; Suid. v. Z60vfios.) [E. H. B.]

'TKMPSDIA (h TfMorSia. Pud. vi. 4. § 3). one of

tlie diatiicts into which ancient Persia was divided.

It cannot now be determined exactly what its posi­

tion was; but. as it adjoined the Mesabatae, it pro-

bcbly was part of a long narrow plain which extends

through that province in a direction north-west and

south-east. (Lassen, in Ersch uud timber's Encycl.

vol. xvii. p. 438.) [V.]

Phrygia, and dividing Mysia into two halves, n

sources of the Macestus, Mysius, Caicus, and

Hamilton (Researches, Vi. p. 125) is inclined to be­

lieve that Mons Temnus is the same as the Ak

I EMNUS ( TTj^roy: Eth. Ttj^h'ttjj). a town of

Aeolis in Asia Minor, not far from the river Hermus,

situated on a height, from which a commanding view

was obtained over the territories of Cyme. Phocaea,

and Smyrna. (Strab. xiii. p. 621.) From a pa>sagc

in Pausanias (v. 13. § 4). it might be inferred that

the town was situated on the northern bank of the

Jlermus. Hut this is irreconcilable with the state­

ment that Teinnus was 30 miles south of Cyme, and

with the remarks of all other writers alluding to

the place. Pliny (v. 29) ulso seems to l»e mistaken

in placing Temnus at the mouth of the Hermus, for

although the deposits of the river have formed an

extensive alluvial tract of land, it is evident that the

sea never extended as far as the site of Temnus. The

town had already much decayed in the time of Stra-

bo. though it never ap|-ears to have been verv large.
