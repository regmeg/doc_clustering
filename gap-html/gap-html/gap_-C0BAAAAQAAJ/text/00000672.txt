PHAENO (4»a»'w, Euseb. Onomaai, s.v. $wu>v;

4»acca, Hierocl. p. 723), formerly a city of Idumaea,

ami afterwards a village of Arabia Petraea, between

Petra and Zoar, containing copper mines, where con­

demned criminals worked. It was identitied with

Punon, one of the stations of the Israelites in their

wanderings. {Numb, xxxiii. 42; see lieland, Pa-

hteMiiui, p. 9")I; Weueling, <ul Hierocl. I. c.)

PH A EST US. \.(<bai<rr6$: Kth. Qatar ios),t\ town

in the S. of Cre'e, distant 60 stadia from Gortyna,

and 20 from the sea. (Strab. x. p. 479; Plin.

iv. 12. s. 20.) It was said to have derived its name

from au eponymous hero Pbaeatua, a son of Her­

cules, who migrated from Stcyon to Crete. (Pans,

ii. ti. § 7 ; Staph. 11. s. v.; Kustath. ad Bom. K c.)

According to others it was founded by Minos. (Diod.

v. 78; Strab. /. c.) It is mentioned by Homer {It.

ii. 048), and was evidently one of the most ancient

places in the island. It was destroyed by the Gor-

tynians, who took possession of it* territory. (Strab.

I. c.) Its port was Matalum, from which it was

distant 40 stadia, though it was only 20 from the

coa^t. (Strab. I. c.) We also learn front Strabo

that Epimenides was a native of Phaestus. The in­

habitants were celebrated for their sharp and witty

sayings. (Athen. vi. p. 2fil,e.) Phaestns is men­

tioned also by Seylax, p. 18; Polyb. iv. 55.

Stephanos B. (*. v. Qataros) mentions in the

territory of Phaestus a place called Kisses, which he

identities with a rock in the Odyssey (iii. 293),

where in our editions it is not used as a proper name,

but :is au adjective,—Aiffe-f), "smooth." Strabo

(/. c.) mentions a place Olysses or Olyssc in the

territory of Phaestus {'OKwa-qv ♦•wrrior);

but this name is evidently corrupt; and instead of it

we ought probably to read lasses, 'litis place must

nut be confounded with Lissus. which was situated

much more to the \V. (Kramer, ml Strab. I. c.)
