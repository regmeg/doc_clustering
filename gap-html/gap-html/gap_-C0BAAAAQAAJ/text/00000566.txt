OLYMPUS ("OAu/awos). 1. A mountain range

of Mysia, extending eastward as far as tlie river

Sangarius, and dividing Phrygia from Bithynia.

To distinguish it from other mountains of the .same

name, it often is called the Mysian Olympus. Us

height rises towards the west, and that part which is

of the greatest height, is the highest mountain in all

Asia Minor. The country around this mountain was

well peopled, but its heights were thickly clad with

wood, and contained many safe retreats for robbers,

bands; of whom, under a regular leader, often rendered

the country unsafe. (Strab. xii. p. ."i74, eomp. x.

p. 470, xii. p. 571; Herod, i. 36, vii. 74; Ptol. v. 1.

§ 10; Steph. B.s.v.; Plin. v. 40, 43; Pomp, Mela,

i. 19; Airim. Marc. xxvi. 9, Schul. ad Apollon.

Hh'td. i. 598.) The lower regions of this great

mountain are still covered with extensive forests; hut

the summit is rocky, devoid of vegetation, and

during the greater part of tiie year covered with

snow. The Turks generally call it Anadvli Dagh,

though the western or highest parts also bear the

name of KeshUh Dagh, that is, the Monk's Mountain,

and the eastern Ttmmaivlji or Domoun Dagh. The

Byzantine historians mention several fortresses to

defend the passes of Olympus, such as Pitheca

(Xicet. Chun. p. 35; B. Ciunam. p. 21), Acrunum,

and Calogroea (B. Cinnam. /. <*.; Cedren. p. 553;

Anna Comn. p. 441; comp. Brown, in Walpole's

Turh >/, torn, ii. pp. 109, foil.; Poeocke, Trawls iii.

•p. 178).

2. A mountain in the north of Galatia, which it

separates from Bithynia. It is, properly shaking,

only a continuation of the My>ian Olympus, and is

reaiarkable in history for the defeat sustained on it

by the Tolistoboii, in a battle against the Romans

under Man 1 his. (Liv. xxxviii. 19, &c; Polyb. xxii.

20. 21.) Its modern name is Ah Dagh.

3. A volcanic mountain in the east of Lycia, a

little to the north-east of Corydalla. It also bore

the name of Phoenicns, and near it was a large town,

likewise bearing the name Olympus. (Strab. xiv.

p. 66G.) Ju another passage (xiv. p. 671) Strabo

speaks of a mountain Olympus and a stronghold of the

same name in Cilicia. from which the whole of Lycia,

Pamphylia, and Pisidia could be surveyed, and which

was in his time taken possession of by the Isaurian

robber Zenicetas. It is, however, generally supposed

that this Cilician Olympus is no other than the

Lycian, and that the geographer was led into his

mistake by the fact that a town of the name of

Coryeus existed both in Lycia and Cilicia. On the

Lycian Olympus stood a temple of Hephaestus.

(Comp. Siivitasm. Mar. Mag. § 205; Ptol. v. 3.

§ 3.) Scylax (39) does not mention Olympus, but

his Siderus is evidently no other place. (Leake, Asia

Minor, p. 189; Fellows,Lycia,pp. 212, foil.; Sprat:

and Forbes, Travels in Lycia, i. p. 192.) Mount

Olympus now hears the name Janar Dagh} anil the

town that of Dtliktash ; in the latter place, which

was lirst identified by Beaufort, some ancient remains

still exist; but it does not appear ever to have been

a larce town, as Strabo calls it. [L. S-l
