that it existed in Moravia, in the neighbourhood of

Znaim. [L. S.]

PHUSIPARA (*ouo-iwdpo), a town of the dis­

trict of Slelitene in Armenia Minor, between Ciuiaca

and Eusemara, is mentioned only by Ptolemy (v. 7.

§ [l. s.]

P11YCUS (*i/*ouf, Strab. viii. p. 363, xvii. p.

837; Ptol. iv. 4. § 5: Plin. v. S), the most

northerly point of the Libyan coast, 2800 stadia

from Taenarum (350 M.P., Plin. la), and 125

SI. P. from Crete. (Plin. /. c.) Cato touched at

this point in Africa after leaving Crete, but the

natives refused to receive his ships. (Lucan, ix.

40.) Synesius, who has given in his letters (A'p.

51, 100, 114, 129) several particulars about this

spot, states that it was dangerous to live here because

of the stagnant waters, and their fetid exhalations. It

had a harbour situated to the \Y., which is confirmed

by the Coast-describer (Stadiium. § 53, where it is by

an error called Phoenicus). Scylnx (p. 46) placed tlio

gardens and lake of the Hcsperidcs near this headland,

now Kds-al-Jiazat or R&s Sent, where Smyth (Medi­

terranean, p. 455) marks the coast bold and steep,

rising gradually to Cyrcne. (Pncho, Voyage, p.

169: Barth, Wanderungen, p. 498.) [E. B. J.j

PHY'LACE (+u\djcTj: Eth. *i/Aiwt)<no5.) 1. A.

town of Phthiotis in Thessaly, one of the places

subject to Protesilaus, and frequently mentioned in

the Homeric poems. (/£ ii. 695, xiii. 696, xv. 335,

Od. xi. 290; comp. Apoll. Khod. i. 45; Steph. B.

i v.) It contained a temple of Protesilaus. (I'ind.

hthm. i. 84.) Pliny erroneously calls it a town of

Magnesia (iv. 9. s. 16). Strabo describes it as

standing between Pharsalus and Phthiotic Thebes,

at the distance of about 100 stadia from the latter

(ix. pp. 433, 435). Leake places it at about 40

minutes from Ckidek, in the descent from a pass,

where there are remains of an ancient town. The

situation near the entrance of a pass is well suited

to the name of Phylace. (Leake, Northern Greece,

vol. iv. pp. 332, 364.)

2. A town <>{ Slolossis in Epeirus, of uncertain

site. (Liv. xlv. 26.)

3. A place in Arcadia, upon the frontiers of

Tcgea and Laconia, where the Alpheius rises. (Pans,

viii. 54. § I.)

4. A town of Pieria in Slacedonia (Ptol. iii. 1.1.

§ 40), the inhabitants of which are mentioned by

Pliny under the name of Phylacaei (iv. 10. s. 17).

PHYLACEIUSI (*u\aKtu>v or riuAoitoioi'), a

town of western Phrygia, at a short distance from

Theinisonium. (Ptol. v. 2. § 26; Tab. Pent.;

Gi'Ogr. Kav. i. 18, where it is called Filaction.)

The Phrygian tribe of the ♦uAoK^i'O'toi, mentioned

by Ptolemy (v. 2. § 27), undoubtedly derived its

name from this place. [L. S.]

PHYLE. [Attica, p. 329, b.]

PHYLLKIUM, PHYLLUS. [Astkiuum.]

PHYLLIS (4>uAAc5), a district of Thrace in tho

neighbourhood of Sit. Pangaeus, bounded by the An-

gites on the W. and by the Strymon on the S.

(Herod, vii. 113; Steph. B. *. t>.)

PIIYR1TES, a small tributary of the Cavstrus,

having its origin in the wotern branch of Sluunt

Tmolus, and flowing in a southern direction through

the Pcgasean marsh (Stagnum Pegaseum), dis­

charges itself into the Cavstrus some distance above

Ephcsus. (Plin. v. 31.) [L. S.]
