1114 TAUROMEXIl'M. TAUROMENIUM.

1 lie Carthaginians, who were guarding the straits of }

Messana, and crossed direct from Kliegimn to Tauro­

ineniuin. (Diod. xvi. 08; Pint. Timol. 10.) Tbe

city was at that time still under the government of

Andromachus, whose mild and equitable administra­

tion is said to have presented a strong contrast with

that of the despots and tyrants of the other Sicilian

cities. lie welcomed Timoleon with open arms, and

afforded him a secure resting place until he was

enabled to carry out his plans in other parts of Sicily.

(Diod. I. c.; Plut. /. c.) It is certain that Andro­

inachus was not deprived of the chief power, when

:ill the other tyrants were expelled by Timoleon, but

was permitted to retain it undisturbed till bis death.

(Marcellin. Vit. Thucyd.§ 27.) We hear, however,

very lit tie of Tauroineniuin for some time after this.

It is probable that it passed under the authority of

Agathocles, who drove the historian Timaeus into

exile; and some time after this it was subject to a

domestic despot of the name of Tjndarion, who was

contemporary with Hicetas of Syracuse and Fhintias

of Agrigentum. (Diod. xxii. Exc. 11. p. 495.) Tyn-

darion was one of those who concurred in inviting

Pyrrhus into Sicily (n.c. 278), and wbeu that

monarch landed with bis army at Tauromenimu,

joined him with all his forces, and supported him in

his march upon Syracuse. (Diod. c. pp. 495, 49G.)

A few years later we find that Tauroineniuin had

fallen into tbe power of Hieron of Syracuse, and was

employed by him as a stronghold in the war against

the Maniert'mcs. {Ib. p. 497.) It was also one of

the cities which was left under his dominion by the

treaty concluded with him by the Romans in B.C.

203. (Diod. xxiii. p. 502.) This is doubtless the

reason that its name is not again mentioned during

the First Punic War.

There is no doubt that Tauromeiiium continued

to form a part of the kingdom of Syracuse till the

death of Hieron, and that it only passed under the

government of Home when the whule. island of Sicily

was reduced to a Roman province; but we have

scarcely any account of the part it took during the

Second Punic W ar, though it would appear, from a

hint in Appian {Sic. 5), that itsubniitted to Marcel-

lus on favourable terms; and it is probable that it

was on that occasion it obtained the peculiarly

favoured position it enjoyed under tbe Roman domi­

nion. For we learn from Cicero that Tauromeninm

was one of the three cities in Sicily which enjoyed

the privileges of a ''eivilas foederata" or allied city,

thus retaining a nominal independence, and was not

even subject, like Messana, to the obligation of fur­

nishing ships of war when called upon. (Cic. Ycrr.

ii. 00, iii. 0, v. 19.) Iiut the city suffered severe

calamities during the Servile War in Sicily, b.c.

134—132. having fallen into the hands of the in­

surgent slaves, who, on account of the great strength

of its position, made it one of their chief posts, and

were able for a long time to defy the arms of the

consul Kupilius. They held out until they were

reduced to the most fearful extremities by famine,

when the citadel was at length betrayed into the

hands of the consul by one of their leaders named

Sarapion, and the whole of the survivors put to the

sword. (Diod. xxxiv. Exc. Phot, p. 528; Oros. v. 9.)

Tauromeninm again bore a conspicuous part during

the wars of Sextus Tompeius in Sicily, and, from its

strength as a fortress, was one of the principal points

of the position which he took up in B.C. 36, for de­

fence against Ootavian. It became the scene also of

a sea-tight between a part of the fleet of Octavian,

commanded by the tiiamvir in person txi

Pompeias, which terminated in the defeat a. i tk ■:

total destruction of the former. (Af-iur.fi.'. t.
