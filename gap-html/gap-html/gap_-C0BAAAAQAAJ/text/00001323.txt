TULLUM. 12.W TURIA.

TULMJM (TiiWw), in Gallia Belgica, is one of

be citiet of the Lead, who bordered on the Me-

jotnatrici. (Ptol. ii. 9. § 13.) Naaium is the

<ber city [Nasum J. The Notitia of the Provinces

1 Gallia mentions Tullum thus: "Civitas Leu-

rnm Tollu.'' Tail, which is Tullum, has pro-

mod its name instead of taking the name of the

oiple, like most other capital towns. Tout is in

lie department of the Meurthe. [G. L.]

TUNES (T«n|», Polyb. i. 30; Tofru, or Twit,

■rrab. xvii. p. 834, Sec), a strongly fortified town,

nee of some importance, in the Roman proTince of

ktrica. According to Polybiua (xiv. 20), who is

■llowed by Liry (xxi. 9), it was 120 stadia or 15

TUXTOBR1GA (Tew-roSsiTa. Ptol. ii. 6. §

rods. [T. H. D.J

Tl RANIANA, a place in Hispania Raetica, not

TURBA. [BlGKRBIOXED.]

11 RBULA (TooaaouAo, PtoL ii. 6. § 61), a

"*u of the Bastetani in Hispania Tan-acouensi*.

'Aiiville (Gtvgr. An. L p. 28) and Mentelle (Etp.

Anc. p. 17") identify it with Teruel; but Ukert (ii.

pt. i. p. 407) more correctly declares it to be Tocorra

in Murcia. The inhabitants are called ToD&iAirriu

by App. Hitp. 10. [T. H. D.J

TURCAE (ToCokoi, Snid. J. r.), a Scythian

people of Asiatic Sarmatia, dwelling on the Pains

Alaeotis, which appears to be identical with the

'Iup<ou of Herodotus (iv. 22, &c). The various

hypotheses that have been started respecting the

Turcae only show that nothing certain is known re­

specting them. (Cf. Manner!, iv. p. 130; Heeren,

liken, i. 2, pp. 189, 281, 307; Schafl'arik, Slav. Al-

terth, i. p. 318, etc) Humboldt (Central-Atien,

i. p. 245, ed. Mahlmann) opposes the notion that

these Turcae or Jyrcae were the ancestors of the

present Turks. [T. H. D.J

TURCILLNGI, a tribe in northern Germany

which is not noticed before the fifth century of

our era, and then is occasionally mentioned along

with the Rugii. (Jornand. Gel. 15; Paul. Diac.

i. 1.) [L.8.]

TURDETA'XI (TwpJwreW, Ptol. ii. 4. § 5, .Sic),

the principal people of Hispania Baetica; whence

we find the name of Turdetania (Tuvpbijrcwia or

Tovpn/TaWa) used by Strabo (iiL p. 136) and Ste­

phanas Byz. (p. 661) as identical with Baetica.

Their territory lay to the W. of the river Singulis

(now Xenil), on both sides of the Baetis as far aw

Lusitauia on the W. The Turdetani were the most

civilised and polished of all tlie Spanish tribes.

They cultivated the sciences; they had their poeU

and historians, and a code of written laws, drawn

up in a metrical form (Strab. iiL pp. 139. 151,167;

Polyb. xxxiv. 9). Hence they were readily disposed

to adopt the manners and customs of their con­

querors, and became at length almost entirely

Romans; but with these characteristics we are not

surprised to find that they are at the same time

represented by Livy (xxxiv. 17) as the most nn-

warlike of all the Spanish races. They possessed

the Jus Latii. Some traits in their manners are

noted by Diodorus Sic. (v. 33), Siiius Italicus (iii.

340, fteq.), and Strabo (iii. 164). Their superior

civilisation was no doubt derived from their inter­

course with the Phoenicians whose colony of

Tartessus lay in their neighbourhood. [T. II. D.J

TURDUL1 (TovpooiAoi, Ptol. ii. 4. § 10), a

people in Hispania Baetica, very nearly connected

with the Turdetani, and ultimately not to be dis­

tinguished from them. (Strab. iii. p. 139; Polyb.

xxxiv. 9). They dwelt to the E. anil S. of the

Turdetani, down to the shores of the Fretum Her-

culenm. A branch of them called the Turduli

Veteres appears to have migrated into Lusitauia,

and to have settled to the S. of the Durius; where

it is probable that in process of time they be­

came amalgamated with the Lusitanians (Strab. iii.

p. 151; Mela, iii. 1. § 7; Plin. iii. 1. «. 3. iv. 21. s.

35; cf. Klorez, F.*p. Sagr. ix. p. 7). [T. H. I'.J

TUREC10N1CUM or TURECIONXUM, in Gal­

lia Narbonensis, is placed in the Table on a mad

TURIA or TURIUM, a river in the territory of

the KdeUni in Hispania Tarraconensis, which enters

the sea in the neighbourhood ofValentia (Mela, ii.6;

Plin. iii. 3. s. 4; Vib. Seq. p. 227, ed. Bip.) It was

famed for the proelinm Tnriense between Pnmpev

and Sertorius (Pint. Pomp. 18, SerL 19; Cic. p.
