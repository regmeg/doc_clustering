duces an abundance of grain of superior quality, as

well as wool, honey, ami wax, besides raising silk-

wortns. (Leake, Nttrthern Greece, vol. iii. p. 163.)

A list of the towns in Pallene is given under Chal-

cidick. [E. B.J.]

PALM AM, AD, a station on the coast-road of

Syrtiea, 12 M. P. from Leptis Magna, and 15 M. P.

from Quintiliana {Petit. Tab.). This position agrees

wiili that of the ruins found at Stba Burdj, (Barth,

Wa/uierungen, p. 304.) [E. B. J.]

PALMA'RIA (Pa/wantola), a small island in

the Tyrrhenian sea, the most westerly of the group

now known us the Ptmza Islands, or hole di Ponza.

It is between 3 and 4 miles long, and not more

than a quarter of a mile broad; and was doubtless

in ancient, as well as modern times, a dependency

of the neighbouring and more considerable island of

Pontia (Ponza), from which it is only 5 miles dis­

tant. (Plin. iii. 6. s. 12; Mel. ii. 7. § 18: Varr.

It. Ii. hi. 5. § 7.) [E. H. B.]

PALMAT1S (IldA/ianr, Procop. de Aed. iv. 7.

p. 293), a town of Moesia Inferior, between Doros-

toruin and Marcianopolis (Tab. Petit.), perhaps

Kutschuk-Kainardsjik. [T. H. D.]

h. 21: Kth. Palmyrenus, or Palmireuus, Id. /. c), a

city of Syria, situated in 34° 24' N. lat., and 38°

20' E. long. Its Hebrew name, Tadnior, or Thad-

mor, denotes, like its Greek one, a city of palms;

and this appellation is preserved by the Arabs, who

still call it Tedmor. Tadmor was built, or more

probably enlarged, by Solomon in the tenth century

B. c. (1 Kins/8, ix. 18; 2 Chron. viii. 4), and its

identity with Palmyra is shown in the passage of

Joseph us before cited. It \>> seated in a pleasant

and fruitful oasis of the great Syrian desert, and is

well watered by several small streams; but the river

mentioned by Ptolemy is nowhere to be found. Its

situation is tine, under a ridge of hills towards the

W., and a little above the level of an extensive plain,

which it commands on the E. (Wood, Jiuins of

Ptdmyra^ p. 5), at a distance of about 140 miles

ENE. of Damascus. It is not mentioned by Xeno-

plion, who must have passed near it, nor in the

accounts of the conquests of Alexander the Great.

The first historical notice that we find of it is in

Appian, who tells us that M. Antony, under pretence

of punishing its equivocal conduct, but in reality to

enrich his troops with the plunder of a thriving

commercial city, directed his march towards it, but

was frustrated of his object by the inhabitants

removing their goods to the other side of the Eu­

phrates. (B. Civ. v. c. 9.) This account shows

that it must have been a town of considerable wealth;

and indeed its advantageous situation must have

long rendered it an entrepot for the traffic between

the east and Damascus and the Phoenician cities on

the Mediterranean. Yet its name is not mentioned

cither bv Strabo or Mela. Under the first Roman

emperors it was an independent city; and its situation

on the borders of the Koman and Parthian empires

gave it a political importance, which it teems to

have preserved by a well-judged course of policy,

though naturally exposed to much danger in the |

quarrels of two such formidable neighbours. ("Inter |

duo imperia summa, et prima in discurdia semper i

Under this extraordinary woman, whose talent* a

accomplishments were equalled by her beauty ■

whose love of literature is shown by her p*:mci(j
