THU'Itll (Bovptoi: F.th. &oupifos, Thurinus),

cnlled also by some Latin writers anil by Ptolemy

Thukium (Qovpiov, Ptol.), a city of Magna Graecia,

situated on the Tarentine gulf, within a short dis­

tance of the site of Syharis, of which it may be con­

sidered as having taken the place. It was one of

tlu- latest of all the Creek colonies in this part of

Italy, not having been founded till nearly 70 years

after the fall of Syharis. The site of that city had

remained desolate for a period of 58 years after its

destruction by the Crotom'ats [Sybaius]; when at

lengthen B.C. 452, a number of the Sybarite exile* and

their descendants made an attempt to establish them-

sel es attain on the spot, under the guidance of some

leaders of Thessalian origin ; and the new colony rose

so rapidly to prosperity that it excited the jealousy

of the Crotoniats, who, in consequence, expelled the

new set this a little more than 5 years after the

establishment of the colony. (Diod. xi. 90, xii. 10.)

The fugitive Sybarites first appealed for support to

Sparta, but without success: their application to

the Athenians was more successful, and that people

determined to send out a fresh colony, at the same

time that they reinstated the settlers who had been

lately expelled from thence. A body of Athenian

colonists was accordingly sent out by Pericles, under

the command of Lampon and Xenocritus; but the

number of Athenian citizens was small, the greater

part of those who took part in the colony being col­

lected from various parts of Greece. Among them

were two celebrated names,—Herodotus the historian,

and the orator Lysias. both of whom appear to have

formed part of the original colony. (Diod. xii. 10;

Strab. vi. p. 263; Dionys. Lys. p. 4*53; Vit. X. Oral.

p. 835; lMut. Peric. 11, AVer. 5.) The new colonists

at first established themselves on the site of the de­

serted Sybaris. but shortly afterwards removed (ap­

parently in obedience to an oracle) to a spot at a short

distance from thence, where there was a fountain

named Thuria, from whence the new city derived its

name of Thurii. (Diod./.c; Strab I.e.) The foun­

dation of Thurii is assigned by Diodorus to the year

416 n. c.; but other authorities place it three years

later, b. c. 443. and this seems to be tne best au­

thenticated date (Clinton, F. H. vol. ii. p. 54.) The

protection of the Athenian name probably secured

the rising colony from the assaults of the Crotoniats,

at least we bear nothing of any obstacles to its pro­

gress from that quarter; but it was early disturbed

by dissensions between the descendants of the original

Sybarite settlers and the new colonists, the former

laying claim not only to honorary distinctions, but to

the exclusive possession of important political privi­

leges. These disputes at length ended in a revolu­

tion, and the Sybarites wi re finally expelled from the

city. They established themselves for a short time

upon the river Traens, but did not maintain their

footing long, being dislodged and finally dispersed

by the neighbouring barbarians. (Diod. xii. 11,22;

Arist. Pol. v. 3.) The Thnrians meanwhile con­

cluded a treaty of peace with Crotona, and the new

city rose rapidly to prosperity. Fresh colonists

poured in from all quarters, especially the Pelopon-

nese; and though it continued to be generally re-

gar led as an Athenian colony, the Athenians iu fact

formed but a small element of the popda!i:c T*
