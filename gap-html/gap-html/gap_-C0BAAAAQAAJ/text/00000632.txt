54C PAPHLAGONIA. PANTICAPAFX'M.

Crimea Kertch is still called Bos}H>r. The oU name,

however, continued in use f*>r a long lime; for in

the kalian charts of tlift middle ages we find the

town called Pamlico or Fundico, as well as liosjtro

or I 'utpro.

The walls of the city were repaired by Justinian.

(Pnx'op. </e Aedif. iii. 7.)

The site of Pantieapacum is well described by

Stnibo. "Pantieapaeuin," be says, " is a hill, 20

btailia in circumference, covered with buildings on

every Mile : towards the cast it has a harbour and

docks tor 30 ships ; it has aUo a citadel" (vii.

p. .i'.io). The hill is now called the Arm-chair of

Mithridates. The modern town of Kertch stands at

the fool lit the hill, a great part of it upon alluvial

soil, the site of which was probably covered by the sea

in ancient times Hence tlie hay on the northern side

of the city appears to have advanced originally much

further into the land; and there was probably at

one time a second port on the southern side, of which

there now remains only a small lake, separated from

the sea by a bar of sand. Foundations of ancient

buildings and heaps of brick and pottery are still

scattered over the hill of Mithridates; but the most

remarkable ancient remains are the numerous tu­

muli round Kertch, in which many valuable works

of art have been discovered, and of which a full ac­

count is riven in the works mentioned below. The

most extraordinary of these tumuli are (hone of the

kings situated at the mountain called Altun-Ul»tt or

th«' golden mountain, by the Tartars. One of the

tumuli is in the form of a cone, 100 feet high and

450 feet in diameter, and cased on its exterior with

large blocks of .-lone, cubes of 3 or 4 feet, placed

without cement or mortar. This remarkable monu­

ment has been at all times the subject of mysterious

legends, but the entrance to it was not discovered

till 1832. Tins entrance led to a gallery, con­

structed of layers of worked stone without cement,

fit J feet long and 10 feet InVh, at the end of which

was a vaulted chamber, 35 feet high and 20 feet in

diameter, the floor of which was 10 feet below the

floor of the entrance. This chamber, however, was

empty, though on the ground was a large square

t>t <ui\ on which a sarcophagus might have rested.

Thi> tumului stands at a spot nhere two branches

ol a loriu' rampart meet, which extends N. to the Sea

of Azof and SK. to the Bosporus just above Nymph-

aeum. It was probably tin- ancient boundary of the

territory of Panticapaeum and of the kingdom of

the Bosporus, before the conquest of Nymphaeum

and Theudnsia. Within the rampart, 150 paces to

the E., there is another monument of the same kind,

hut unfinished. It consists of a circular esplanade,

500 paces round and 166 in diameter, with an ex­

terior covering of Cyclopean masonry, built of worked

stones, 3 feet long and high, of which there are

only five layers. But the L'reate-t discovery has

been at the lull, called by the Tartars Kut-Obo, or

the hill of cinders, which is situated outside of the

ancient rampart, and 4 miles from Kertch, Here

is a tumulus 165 feel in diameter; and as some

soldiers were carrying away from it in 1830 the

stones with which it was covered, they accidentally

opened a passage into the interior, A vestibule, 6

teet Bquare, led into a tomb 15 feet long; and 14

broad, which contained bones of a king and queen,

golden and silver vases, and other ornaments. Below

this tomb was another, still richer; and from the

two no less than 120 [rounds' weight of g.il orna­

ments are said to haw been extracted. From the

firms of the letters found here,as well as frwi *o*r

circumstances, it is supj*>>ed that \ht t«nt> **»
