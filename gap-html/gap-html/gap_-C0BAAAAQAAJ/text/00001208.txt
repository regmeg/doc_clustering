1 122 TELOXXOL TELLENAE

TELLE'NAE (T(Wt)vt): Dion. Hal.; TfWwat,

Strab.: Elh. TeAArji'ti/?, Tellcncnsis), nn ancient

city of Latium, which figures in the early Roman

history. According to Dionysius it was one of the

cities founded by the Aborigines soon after their

settlement in Latium (Dionys. i. 16), a proof at

least that it was regarded as a place of great anti-

ijuity. Livy also reckons it as one of the cities of

the Prisci Latini (i. 33). which may perhaps point

Id the same result, while Diodorus includes it in his

list of the colonies of Alba. (Diod. vii. ap, Euseb.

Arm. p. 185.) It was attacked by the Roman

king Ancus Marcius, who took the city, and trans­

lated the inhabitants to Koine, where he settled

them on the Aventine, together with those of Poli-

Ittrium and Ficana. (Liv. i 33; Dionys. iii. 38,43.)

Tellenae, however, does not seem, like the other two

places just mentioned, to have been hereby reduced

to insignificance; for its name appears again in B.C.

493 among the confederate cities of the Latin League

(Dionys. v. CI); and though this is the last mention

that we find of it in history, it is noticed both by

Strabo and Dionysius as a place still in existence in

their time. (Dionys. i. 16; Strab. v. p. 231.) It is

probable, however, that it had nt that time fallen

into complete decay, like Antemnae and Collatia; as

it. is only mentioned by Pliny among the once cele­

brated cities of Latium, which had left no traces of

their existence in his day (Din. iii. 5. s. 9), and

from this time its name wholly disappears. The

notices of Tellenae afford scarcely any clue to its

position; though the circumstance that it continued

to be inhabited, however slightly, down to the days

of Augustus, would afford lis more hope of being

able to identify its site than is the case with Poli­

torium, Apiolae, and other places, which ceased to

exist at a very early period. It is this reason that

lias led Nibby to identify the ruins of an ancient

city at La Gtostra, as those of Tellenae, rattier than

Politorium, as supposed by Gell. [Politorium.]

The site in question is a narrow ridge, bounded by

two ravines of no great depth, but with abrupt and

precipitous banks, in places artificially scarped, and

still presenting extensive remains of the ancient

walls, constructed in an irregular style of massive

quadrangular blocks of tnfo. No doubt can exist

that these indicate the site of an ancient city, but

whether of Politorium or Tellenae, it is impossible

to determine; though the remains of a Roman villa,

which indicate that the spot must have been in­

habited in the early ages of the Empire, give some

additional probability to the latter attribution. La

Ghstra is situated on the right of the Via Appia,

about 2 miles from a farm-house called Fiorano,

immediately adjoining the line of the ancient high­

road. It is distant It) miles from Rome, and 3

from Le Frattocckie, on the Via Appia. adjoining

iii'-ruins of liovillae. (Hell, T<>p. of Rome* pp. 280

— 2S3; Nibby, Dintonti, vol. i:i. pp. 140—153.)

Whether the proverfii.il expression of " tricae Tel­

lenae" has any reference to the ancient city of

Latium or not, can hardly be determined, the origin

and meaning of the phrase being involved in com­

plete obscurity. (Varro, ap. Non. i. p. 8; Arnob.
