ated at the foot of Mount Geraneia, at a spot con­

venient for the junction of troops marching from

Plataea in the one direction, and from the Isthmus

in the other. Pausanias (I. c.) also describes it as

lying at the foot of Geraneia on the road from

Delphi to Argos. This author relates that it de-

rived its name from a tripod, which Coroebus the

Argive brought from Delphi, with the injunction

that wherever the tripod fell to the ground lie was

to reside there and build a temple to Apollo,

(Comp. Conon, Narrat. 19.) Leake noticed the

vestiges of an ancient town at the foot of Mt. Gera­

neia, on the road from Plataea to the Isthmus, four

or five miles to the N\V. of Megara. (Leake, North­

ern Greece, vol. ii. p. 410,)

TRI'POMS (Tpi'iroAis, Ptol. v. 15. § 4: Eth.

TpnroAffijy; A<?j. Tripoliticus, Plin. xiv. 7. s. 9), an

important maritime town of Phoenicia, situated on

the N. side of the promontory of Theuprosopon.

(Strab. xvi. p. 754.) The site of Tripolis has been

already described, and it has been mentioned that it

derived its name, which literally signifies the three

cities, from its being the metropolis of the three

confederate towns, Tyre, Sidon, and Aradus [Phoe­

nicia, Vol. II. p. 606]. Each of those cities had

here its peculiar quarter, separated from the rest by

a wall. Tripolis possessed a good harbour, and, like

the rest of the Phoenician towns, had a large mari­

time commerce. (Cf. Joannes Phocas, c. 4; Wesse-

ling, ad I tin. Ant. p. 149.) Respecting the modern

Tripoli (Tarablus or Tripoli di Soria); see Po-

cocke, vol. ii. p. 14G, seq.; Maundrell, p. 26; Burck-

hardt, p. 103, seq.,&c.; cf. Scyl.ix, p. 42; Mela, i.

(It. Ant. p. 336; Tab. Pent.) It was situated 12

miles to the north-west of Hierapolis, and is not men­

tioned by any writer before the time of Pliny (v. 30),

who treats it as a Lydian town, anil says that it was

washed by the Maeandcr. Ptolemy (v. 2. § 18)

anil Stephanies It. describe it as a Carian town, and

the latter (s.u.) adds that in his time it was called

Neapolis. Hierocles (p. 669) likewise calls it a

Lydian town, liuins of it still exist near Ymiji or

Kath YenijL (ArundelL, Sew* Owcfca.f2C:
