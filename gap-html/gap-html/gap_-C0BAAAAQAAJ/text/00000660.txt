to have possessed a large tract of mountainous

country to the N. of the Dassaretae, and extending

to the E. as fur as the frontier of Macedonia, while

on the \V. and NW. it almost reached to the

Labeates and the dominions of Gentius. (Liv. xliii.

pp. 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, xiiv. 11.) The principal

city of this warlike tribe was Uscana; besides which

they had the two fortresses of Duaudacum and

Oaenei m. [E. B. J.]

PENIEL or PENUEL (i.e. "Face of God,"

E/5oy 0fof, LXX.), a place beyond Jordan, where

Jacob wrestled with the angel {Gen. xxxii. 30).

and where a town was afterwards fuunded by the

tribe of Gad. (Judge*, viii. 8.)

PE'NIUS, a small river of Colchis, falling into

the Euxine, on which stood a town of the same

name. (Tlin. iv. 4; Ov. cx Pont. iv. 10. 47.)

PENXELOCUS, in the Antonine Itin., and PEN-

NOH'COS in the Peutinger Table, is a place in

Gallia in tlie country of the Nantuates, between Vi-

viscus (Vevay) and Tarnaja (St. Maurice,}. In the

Itins. the distance of Pennelocus from Viviscus is

marked viiii.; but it is uncertain whether they are

Roman miles or Gallic leagues. It is generally as­

sumed that VUlenenve at the eastern end of the Lake

of Geneva is the site of Pennelocus, but the distance

from Vevay does not agree, D'Anville found in

some old maps a place called Penne on the direction

of the road, but the position of Penne does not agree

with the distances in the Itins. Pennelocus was in

the Vallis Pennina or the Valais. [G.L.]

PENNOCRUCIUM, a town in the territory of

PEN 1 RI (UtvTpot), a tribe of the Samnites, and

apparently one of the most important of the sub­

divisions of that nation. Their capital city was

Boviant;m (Liv. ix. 31), in the very heart of the

Samnite territory, and it is therefore probable that

they occupied the whole of that rugged and moun­

tainous district which extends from the frontiers of

Latium, in the valley of the Liris, :o those of the

Frentani, towards the Adriatic. But it is impossible

to determine their exact limits, or to separate their

history from that of the remaining Samnites. It is

probable, indeed, that, throughout the long wars of

the Romans with the Samnites, the Pentri were the

leading tribe of the latter people, and always took

part in the war, whether specified or not. The only

occasion when we hear of their separating tbcnrelves

from the rest of their countrymen, is during the

Second Punic War, when we are told that all the!

other Samnites, except the Pentri, declared in favour I

of Hannibal after the battle of Cannae, u. c. 21G.;

(Liv. xxii. 61.) This is the last oocasiea c* wt*J
