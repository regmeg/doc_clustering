170 LECCA& LEUCI MONTHS.

(Liv. xlv. 31.) It continued to be a place of im­

portance down to a late period, as appears from the

fact that the bishop of Lcucas was one of the Fathers

of the Council of Nice in a. d. .1*25. The consti­

tution of I.- ii.,is, like tliat of other Dorian towns,

was originally aristocratica]. The large estates

were in the possession of the nobles, who were not

allowed to alienate them; but when this law was

abolished, a certain amount of property was no

longer required for the holding of public offices, by

which tiie government became democratic (AristoL

PoL ii. 4. § 4.)

Besides Leucas we have mention of two other

places in the island, Phaha (&apa\ Scylax, p. 13),

and Hi i ,lomi m m ('EAAoVevoK, Thuc iii. 94).

The latter name i> preserved in tint of a harbour in

the southern part of the island. Phetae was also

in the same direction, as it is described by Scylax

as opposite to Ithaca. It is perhaps represented by

some Hellenic remains, which stand at the head of

the bay called Basilike.

The celebrated junmiontory Leucatak (Aewcarar,

Scylax, p. 13; Strab. x. pp. 452, 456, 461), also

called Lelcatks or Lkucate (I'lin. iv. 1. a. 2;

Virg. ^4en. iii. 274, viii. 676; Claud. Bell. Get,

185; Liv. xxvi. 26), forming the sonth-western

extremity of the island, is a broken white cliff,

rising on the western side perpendicularly from the

sea to the height of at least 2000 feet, and sloping

precipitously into it on the other. On its summit

stood the temple of Apollo, hence surnamed Leu*

catas (Strab. x. p. 452), and Leucadius (Ov. Triit,

iii. 1. 42, v. 2. 76; Pmpert. iii. 11. 69). This

cape was dreaded by mariners; hence the words of

Virgil (Aen. iii. 274): —

*' Mux et Leucatac nimbosa cacumina montis,  
I.t formidutus nautis apcritur Apollo."

It still retains among the Greek mariners of the

present day the evil fame which it bore of old in

consequence of the dark water, the strong currents,

ami the fierce gales which they there encounter.

Of the temple of Apollo nothing but the sub­

structions now exist. At the annual festival of

the god here celebrated it was the custom to throw

a criminal from the cape into the sea; to break his

fall, birds of all kinds were attached to him, and if

he reached the sea uninjured, boats were ready to

pick him up. (Strab. x. p. 452; Ov.Her. xv. 165,

sco,., TrisL v. 2. 76; Cic. Tusc. iv. 18.) This

appears to have been an expiatory rite, and is sup-

j- <■ ; by most modern scholars to have given rise to

the well-known story of Sappho's leap from this

rock in order to seek relief from the pangs of love.

[See Diet. ofBiogr. Vol. III. p. 708.] Col. Mure,

however, is disposed to consider Sappho's leap as an

historical fact. {History of the Literature of

Greece, vol. iii. p. 295.) Many other persons are

reported to have followed Sappho's example, among

whom the most celebrated was Artemisia of llali-

carnassua, the ally of Xerxes, in his invasion of

cuik or usrcAj.

that the name may be Greek, lie quotes Uoger c*

LEUCE. 1. An island lying off Cydonia, in Creto

(Plin. iv. 12), which Mr. Pashlcy (Trav. vol.i. p-51)

takes for the rock on which the fortress of Suilka is

built. (Comp. Hock, Kreta, vol. i. pp. 384,438.)

2. An island which Pliny (iv. 12) couples with

Onisia, as lying off the promontory of Itaaom.
