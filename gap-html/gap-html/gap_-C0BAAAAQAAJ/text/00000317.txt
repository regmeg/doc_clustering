MAI KITA'XIA. [Mai'Rktahia.]

HAAfcRA (M«|npa, Ptol. vi. 9. § 2: Aram,

lat mil. 6). a river of Hyrcania, which flowed into

*C»pun sea. Pliny calls it tlie Maxeras (vi.  
It i IS). It is not certain with which modem

il b to be identified, and geographers have

piven it to the Tedjin, the Babul, or the

'••ram. If Airunianos, who speaks of it in con-

«■ m. with the Oxus, could be depended on, it

tprcar most probable that it was either the

i*s*«r the Gmyan. The people dwelling along

nw were called Maxerae. (Ptol. vi. 9. §

M [V.]

UA.TJXCA (MafiAoBo, Ptol. ii. 4. § 13), a town

- Banasua Bartica. which, like Calentum, was  
*vwsiad far h> manufacture of a sort of bricks light  
"•ayt t/> nrim on water. (Plin. xxxv. 14. s. 49;

Xrab. xiii. p. 615; Vitruv. ii. 3; Schneider,

«i &i Pays, p 88.) It was probably situated in

aw Semi Mama. (Flora, £sp. Sagr. xii. p.

»AXIMIAS0'P0LIS(Mo4i^io»oi>woah), a town

* larare, formerly called Impaua or Pyrsoalis  
< & As*, p. 331), not far from Rhodope (Aram.

■rxxvu. 4), and the lake Bistouis (Melet p. 439,

MAX1HUX0 POLIS. [Constant™.]

aUIUOAJil/POLIS (MafijuafdxoAis), the

"-"■■a* ipotUation of the Scriptural Hadadrimmon

U*+mmk, a. 11) in the plain of Megiddo, 17

* f- frm Cteareia (of Palestine), and 10 M. P.  
*™ Janel, according to the Jerusalem Itinerary;  
^■swih with whkh notice St. Jerome writes : —

"■•tuuim, pro quo LXX. transtulerunt Po«-

rates jsjja Jeeraelem, quae hoc olim vocabulo

, et hodie vorator Mazimianopolis in

•&t£aa" (Comm. in Zachar. I. c.); and

iiimui Jesraelem, quae nunc juxta Maxi-

t »t" (•» Hot. 1). It is placed in the civil

and ecclesiastical division of Palaestina Secnnil.i, and

its bishop assisted at the Council of Nicaea. (Relnnd,

Palaestina. pp. 891, 892.) [G. W.]

MAXU'LA (Mo{otAo, Ptol. iv. 3. § 7), a Roman

"colonia" (Maxulla, Plin. v. 3), about the exact

distance of which from Carthage there is a consi­

derable discrepancy in the Itineraries (Anton. Jtin.;

Peul. Tab.). From an expression of Victor Vitensis

(de Persecut. Vandal, i. 5. § 6), who calls it " Li-

gula," "a tongue of land," its position was probably on

the coast, between R'ades and llammam-eUEvf,

where there are the remains of a Roman road.

The Coast-describer (Stadiasm.') speaks of the

harbour and town of Maxyla as 20 stadia from

Crapis, or the modern Garbcs: this was probably

different from the former, and is the modem J/rwa,

where there are the remains of a town and harbour

(Shaw, Trav. p. 157; Barth, Wanderwigen, p. 128.)

As connected with the gentile epithet Maxyes or

Mazyes, it is likely that there were several places of

this name. Ptolemy (iv. 3. § 34) has Maxuia

Vetus (Md{oi>Aa riaAaia), and the Antonine

Itinerary a station which it describes as Maxula

Prates, 20 11. P. from Carthage. It is found in

the Notitia, and was famous in the annals of Mar-

tyrology (Augustin, Serin, c. lxxxiii; Morcelli,

Africa Christiana, vol. i. p. 220.) [E. B. J.]

MAXYES (Ma^ufi, Herod, iv. 191, where the

name should be Mafuts ; see Mauretania, p. 297,

a.), a Libyan tribe, and a branch of the nomad Au-

senses. Herodotus (I. c.) places them on the "other

side," i. e. the W. bank, of the river Triton: reclaimed

from nomad life, they were "tillersof the earth, and

accustomed to live in houses." They still, however,

retained some relics of their former customs, as

"they suffer the hair on the right side of their

heads to grow, but shave the left; they paint their

bodies with red-lead :" remains of this custom of

wearing the hair are still preserved among the

Tuaryks, their modem descendants. (Hornemann,

Trav. p. 109.) They were probably the same

people as those mentioned by Justin (xviii. 7), and

called Maxvtaki, whose king is said to have been

Hiarbas (Virg. Aen. iv. 36,196, 326), and to have

desired Dido for his wife. (Heeren, African Nations,

vol. i. p. 34, trans.; Rennell, Geog. of Herod, vol. ii.

p. 303.) [E. B. J.]

MAZACA. [Caesareia, Vol. I. p. 469, b.]

MAZAE1 (Ma^oTot), a Pannoniau tribe, occu­

pying the southernmost part of Pannonia, on the

frontiers of Dalniatia, whence Dion Cassius (Iv.

32) calls them a Dalmatian people. They were

conquered and severely treated by Gcrmanicu*.

(Strab. vii. p. 314 j Plin. iii. 26; Ptol. ii. 16.

§ 8.) [L. S.]

MAZARA (Ma'fapo, Diod.; Mafaprf, Steph. Ii.:

Mazzara), a town on the SW. coast of Sicily, situ­

ated at the mouth of a river of the same name, be­

tween Selinus and Lilybaeum. It was in early

times an inconsiderable place, And is first noticed by

Diodorus in B. c. 409, as an emporium at the

mouth of the river Mazarus. (Diod. xiii. 54.) It

was evidently at this time a dependency of Selinns,

and was taken by the Carthaginian general Han­

nibal, during his advance upon that city. (Diod.

/. c.) Stcphanus of Byzantium calls it " a fort of

the Selinuntincs" (tppobpiov XtKiyovvriuv, Steph.

B. s. v.), and it is mentioned again in the First

Punic War as a fortress which was wrested by the

Romans from the Carthaginians. (Diod. xxiii. 9.

p. 503.)
