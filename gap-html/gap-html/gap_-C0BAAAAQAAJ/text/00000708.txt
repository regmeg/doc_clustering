only to a dialectic difference. Now as the Trojans j

throughout tlie Homeric poems appear as a people

akin to the Greeks, and are even tailed Hellenes

by Dionysius of Hnlicarnxssus (Ant. Rom. i. 61),

it follows that the Phrygians also must have been

related to the Greeks. This, again, is further .sup­

ported by direct evidence; tor, looking apart from

the tradition about Pch>ps, which we have already

alluded to. king Midas is said to have been the first j

of all foreigners to have dedicate*!, about the middle

of the eighth century B. <:., a present to the Delphic!

oracle (Herod, i. 14); and Plato {Crahji p. 410)

mentions several words which were common to the

Greek and Phrygian languages. (Comp. Jablonski,

Opera, vol. iii. p. 64, ike. ed. Te Water.); and,

lastly, the Armenian language itself is now proved

to he akin to the Greek. (Schroeder, T/tesaur. Ling.

Arm. p. 51.) The radical identity of the Phry­

gians, Trojans, and Greeks being thus established,

wo shall proceed to show that many other Asiatic

nations belonged to the same stt>ck. The name of

the Mygdoniaus, as already observed, is often used

synonymously with that of the Phrygians (Paus. x.

27. § 1), and in Homer (//. iii. 186) the leader of

the Phrygians is called Mygdon. According to

.Stephamis 13. (.«. v. Mvybavta), lastly, Mygdonia was

t he name of a district in Great Pbrygia, as well as

of a part of Macedonia. The boliones, who extended

westward as far as the Aesepus, were separated

from the MygdonUns by the river flbyndacus.

(Strab. xiv. p. 681; Sehol. ml Apollon. R/iod. i. 936,

943, 1115.) At a later time they disappear from

history, their name being absorbed by that of the

Phrygians. The Mysians are easily recognisable as

a Phrygian people, both from their history and the

country they inhabited. They, too, are called Th fa­

cialis, and their language is said to have been a

mixture of Phrygian and Lydian (Strab. xii. p. 572),

and Mysians and Phrygians were so intermingled

that their frontiers could scarcely be distinguished.

(Strab. xii. p. 564; Eustath. ad Born. It. ii. 862,

ad DUmys. Per. 810; Suid. *. v. ov<>ti> $}ttov.) As

to the M leonians, see LydiA. The tribes of Asia

Minor, which are usually designated by the name

Pelasgiaus, thus unquestionably were branches of

the great Phrygian stock, and the whole of the

western part of the peninsula was thus inhabited by

a variety of tribes all belonging to the same family.

Hut the Phrygians also extended into Europe, where

their chief seats were in the central [tirts of Emathia.

(Herod, viii. 138; comp. Strab. xiv. p. 680.) There

we meet with Phrygians, or with a modification of

their name, Brygians, in all directions. Mardouius,

on his expedition against Greece, met Brygnms in

Thrace. (Herod, vi. 45; Steph. B. s.v. Bpvnai;

riin. iv. IS, where we have probably to read iirycae

for Brysae.) The Phrygian population of Thrace

is strongly attested by the fact that many names of

places were common to Thrace and Troas. (Strab.

xiii. p. 500; comp, Thucyd. ii. 99: Suid. v. &d-

pupis; Solin. 15; Tzetz. Chil. iii. 812.) Traces of

Phrygians also occur in Chalcidice, (Lycoph. 1404;

Steph. ii. 5. t\ Kpovais.) Further south they appear

about Mount Oeta and even in Attica. (Thucyd.

ii. :i2; Strab. xiii. p. 621; Steph. P. 8. v. <i>pvyU and

♦pficwe; Eustath. ad Diunyn. Per. 810.) Mount

Olympus, also, was perhaps only a repetition of the

Phrygian name. In the vest of Edessa in Mace­

donia, about lake Lychnidus, we meet with Bryges

(Str.ib. vii. pp. 326,'327; Steph. P. s. v. B/»u£), and

iu the same vicinity we have the towns of Brygion,

Bryg'uis, and Mulatto BruciJa. (S-Vph. B. * wv.

If. Hieros. p. 607.) The westernmost tr*es <

Brygians we find about Pyrrlueliium. (Srrib. J, r..

Appian, Bdl Civ. ii. 39; Scymn. 4-13. 436.) I: a

part of Mount Hat-mas seems to have been ooara*

at all times by Thracians; but Phrygiai* axtuwi
