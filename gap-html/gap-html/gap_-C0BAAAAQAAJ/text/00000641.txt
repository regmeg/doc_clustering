900 stadia from Pasira. It is probable that the

PASSARON (Jlaxrvaouv), the ancient capital of

the Molossi in Epeinia. where the kings and as­

sembled people were accustomed to take mutual

oaths, the one to govern according to the laws, the

other to defend the kingdom. (Plut. l*yrrh. 5.)

The town was taken by the Koman praetor L. Ani­

mus Gallus in n. c. 167. (Uv. xlv. 26, 33, 34.)

Its site is uncertain, but it was apparently on the

sea-coast, as Anna Coinnena mentions (vi. 5, p.

284, ed. Bonn) a harbour called Passara on the

coast of Epeirus. If this place is the same as

the older Passaron, the ruins at fJhramisius,

which lie inland in a SMV. direction from loan-

n.'na, cannot be those of the ancient capital of

the Molossi. Those ruins are very considerable,

and contain among other things a theatre in a very

fine state of preservution. (Leake, Northern Greece,

vol. iv. p. 81.)

PATARA (ndrapa: Kth. noTopeoy, Patarensis

or Paturanus). 1. A small town in Cappadocia or

Armenia Minor. (Tab. Peul.)

2. A flourishing maritime and commercial city on

the south-west coast of Lyi'ia. The place was large,

possessed a good harbour, and was said to have beeti

founded by Patarus, a son of Apollo. (Strab. xIy,

p. 666; Steph. B. s. v.) It was situated at a dis­

tance of 60 stadia to the south-ea^t of the mouth of

the river Xanthus. (Stadutsw. Mar. Mag. § 219.)

Patara was most celebrated in antiquity for its

temple and oracle of Apollo, whose renown wus in­

ferior only to that of Delphi ; and the god is often

mentioned with the surname Patareus (Jlarapttis,

Strab. lc.\ Lycoph. 920; Horat, Carm. iiL 4. 64;

Stat. Theb. i. 696; Ov. Met. i. 515; Virp. A en. iv.

143; Pomp. Mela, i. 15.) Herodotus (i. 182) saya

that the oracle of Apollo was deliveicd by a priestess

only during a certain period of the year; and from

Servius (<>•/ AetuLc.) we learn that this period

was the six winter months. It has been suj poced

that the town was of Phoenician or Semitic origin;

but whatever may be thought on this point, it seems

certain that at a later period it received Dorian

?*ttlers from Crete; and the woi^lnp of Apollo was

certainly Dorian. Strabo iuforms us that Ptolemy

Plnladelphu* of Egypt, who enlarged the city, pave

it the name of Arsinoe, but that it nevertheless con­

tinued to be called by its am ient name. Paiara. The

place is often noticed by ancient writers as one of the

principal cities of Lycia, as by Livy, xxxiii.41, xxxvii.

bishopries in the Acts of Councils (Hierocl. p. 684),

and the name J'atera is still attached to its nume­

rous ruins. These, according to the survey of Capt.

Beaufort, arc situated on the sea-shore, a tittle to
