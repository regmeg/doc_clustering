NI'CIA. [Castra, Vol. I. p. 562, a.]

NIC1UM or N1C1U (lWoi» iititdiSwoAis, Ptol.

it. 5. § 9), a principal town in the Nomos Praso-

pites of Lower Aegypt, lay just above Momemphis

and nearly midway between Memphis and Alex­

andras. It was one of the military stations on the

main road between those cities which ran nearly

parallel with the Canonic arm of the Nile. [Pnoso-

rtra] [W. B. D.]

KICOMEDEIA (Nutoaftfeia: Eth. Nncojuj5«ur:

laitmid or Ismid), the capital of Bithynia, situated

on the north-eastern coast of the Sinus Astacenus, a

part of the Propontis. The town of Astacus, a little to

the .south-east of Nicomedeia, was destroyed, or greatly

damaged, by Lysimachus; and some time after, B.C.

264, Xicomedes I. built the town of Nicomedeia, to

which the inhabitants of Astacus were transferred

(Steph. B.«. r.; Strab. xii. p. 563; Paus. v. 12. § 5;

Euseb. Ckron. 01. 129. 1). The founder of the new

city made it the capital of his kingdom, and in a

abort time it became one of the largest and most

flourishing cities, and continued to prosper for more

than six centuries. Pliny, in his letters to the em­

peror Trajan, mentions several public buildings of the

city, such as a senate-house, an aqueduct, a forum,

a temple of Cybele, &c., and speaks of a great fire,

daring which the place suffered much (Epist. x. 42,

46). Respecting its rivalry with Nicaea, see Ni-

CUa. According to Pliny (v. 43), Nicomedeia was

62} miles to the south-east of Chalcedon, while ac­

cording to others it was only 60 or 61 miles distant

(/(..4«tpp. 124, 140; It. Ilieros. p. 572; Tab.

Prut) Under the Roman Empire Nicomedeia was

often the residence of the emperors, such as Diocle­

tian and Constantine, especially when they were en-

raced in war against the Parthians or Persians.

(AnreL Viet, de Cats. 39; Nicephor. vii. in fin.)

The city often suffered from earthquakes, but owing

to the munificence of the emperors it was always re­

stored (Amm. Marc. xvii. 7; Philostorg. iv. p. 506).

It also suffered much from an invasion of the Scy­

thians (Amm. Marc xxii. 9, 12, 13). The orator

Libanius {Oral. 62, torn. iii. p. 337, ed. Reiskc)

imams the loss of its thermae, basilicae, temples,

f jmnasia, schools, public gardens, &c, some of which

were afterwards restored by Justinian (Procop. de

AeH.v. 1; comp. PtoLv. 1. §3, viii.17. §4; Hierocl.

p. 691). From inscriptions we lcam that in the later

com or xicour.DEiA

period of the empire Nicomedeia enjoyed the honour

of a Roman colony (Orelli, Inscript. No. 1060). The

city is also remarkable as being the native place of

Arrian, the historian of Alexander the Great, and as

the place where Hannibal put an end to his che­

quered life. Constantine breathed his last at his

villa Ancyron, near Nicomedeia (Cassiod. Ckron.

Const.; Philostorg. ii. p. 484). The modern Ismid

still contains many interesting remains of antiquity,

respecting which see Pococke, vol. iii. p. 143, &c;

Mar. Erythr. p. 9, ed. Hudson; Tovtxri, Ptol. iv.

7. § 11; Ni'ki, Ptol. i. 17. § 12), one of the

"Runs" of Azania, on the E. coast of Africa, seven

(days' stations) in all. Passing the Noti Cornu of

Ptolemy (ELKhail), the voyager arrived at the

"Strands" (acyioAof), the Little and the Great,

extending six days according to the Periplus, eight

according to Ptolemy's authorities, though he would

reduce the distance to four natural days. The Little

Strand, which occurs first, is doubtless the Self

Tawil, or H Long Sword," of the Arab pilots, so

called from its curvature. The Great Strand is

probably the district now called Merit, "Dry

Desert." These have an extent of 300 miles. Next

comes the peopled shore where Ptolemy (i. 17. § 11)

places 3 towns, Essina ("Eaoipa), the Sakapioxis

Portus (SapawiWos Spuor), and Tonice or Nici,

the Nicon of the Periplus. These towns must lie

placed in the Bara Somauli, or the land of the

Somauli, or Shumdli, a mild people of pastoral ha­

bits, confined to the coast, which they occupy from

the Red Sea to the river Jvba. The "Port of Sa-

rapion" corresponds with Markah, while the

"Run of Nicon" agrees with the point called Torre

in Owen's map. (Narrative of Voyages to explore

NICO'NIUM (NimSiw, Scylax, p. 29), a city of

European Sarmatia, which Strabo (vii. p. 306) places

at 180 stadia from the mouth of the Tyras, while

the anonymous Coast-describer (p. 9) fixes it at

300 stadia from the Isiacorum Portus, and 30

stadia from the Tyras on the coast. Stephanus

of Byzantium (*. p.) states that it was at tlio mouth

of the later, but for "\arpov, Tvpou should probably

be read. Ptolemy (iii. 10. § 16) has removed it from

the coast, and placed it too far to the N. Its posi­

tion must be looked for near Oridiopol. [E. B.J.]

NICO'POLIS (NiiedVoAu : Eth. Nnro7roAfT7jj),

i.e. the "City of Victory." I. In Asia. 1. A

town of Bithynia, on the coast of the Bosporus, a

few miles north of Chalcedon. (Plin. v. 43; Steph.

B. s. v.)

2. A town in Cappadocia or Armenia Minor,

founded by Pompey on the spot where he had gained

his first decisive victory over Mithridates. (Strab. xii.

p. 555; Appian, Mithrid. 101, 105 j Dion Cass.

xxxv. 33; Cacs. Bell. Alex. 36; Plin. vi. 10.) It

was situated in a valley of the river Lycus, a tribu-

taiy of the Iris (*4c(a Martyr, torn. iii. Jul. p. 46),

at a distance of 100 miles to the north-west of Sa-

tala, and 98 to the north-east of Sebastia. It was

a populous town as early as the time of Strabo; but

during the hist period of the Empire it appears to have

suffered much, and its decayed walls were restored by

Justinian. (Procop. de Aed. iii. 4; comp. Ptol. v. 7.
