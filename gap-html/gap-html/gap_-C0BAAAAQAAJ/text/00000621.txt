savC; Jastia, xKU. I.) Pallantium took part

naaadatiao of Megalopolis, B.C. 371 (Paus.

*j *); but it continued to exist an an inde-

pendent state, since we find the Pallantieis mcntioneil

along with the Tegeatae, Megalopolitae and A.-eatae,

as joining Epaminondas before the battle of Man-

tineia, B. c. 362. (Xen. Hell TO. 5. §5.) Pal-

lantium subsequently sank into a mere village, but

was restored and enlarged by the emperor Antoninus

Pius, who conferred upon it freedom from luxation

and other privileges, on account of its reputed con­

nection with Rome. The town was visited by Pau-

sanias, who found here a shrine containing statues of

Pallas and Evander, a temple of Core (Proserpine),

a statue of Polybius; and on the hill above the town,

which was anciently used as an acropolis, a temple of

the pure (frolapot) gods. (Paus. viii.43. § 1, 44. §§5,

6.) Leake was unable to find the site of Pallantium,

and supposed that it occupied a part of Trijnilitza

itself; though at a later time he appears to have

adopted the erroneous opinion of Gell, who placed it

at the village of Thana, to the S. of Tnjwlilza.

(Leake, Morea, vol. i. pp. 117, 118, vol. iii. p. 36;

Gell, Itinerary of the Morea, p. 136.) The remains

of the town were first discovered by the French ex­

pedition at a quarter of an hour's distance from the

Khan of Makri on the road from Tripolitza to

J^eondaru The ruins have been used so long as a

quarry by the inhabitants of Tripolitza and of the

neighbouring villages, that there are very few traces

of the ancient town. Ross discovered the foundations

of the temple of the pure gods on the highest point

of the acropolis. (Boblaye, Recherche*, dr., p. 146;

Ross, Reisen im Peloponne*, p. 58, seq.; Curtius

Peloponnesos, vol. i. p. 263, seq.)

PALLA'NUM, a town of the Frentani, the name

of which is known only from the Tabula, which

places it on the road from Anxanum (Lanviano)

to Histonium; but the distances are corrupt and

confused. According to Romanelli, extensive ruins

still remain of an ancient city on a site still called

Monte Pallano, about 3 miles S\V. of ,1/e a. It

is difficult, however, to reconcile this position with

the course of the route given in the Tabula. (Tab.

Pevt.; Romanelli, vol. Iii. p. 43; Zannoni, Carta del

Regno di Xapoli, UL 4.) [E. H. B.]

lod. I. c, comp. IHstert. de Theog. Het. in Com.

GotL vol. ii. p. 151), who has identified these burn­

ing plains with Pallene, observes, without mentioning

any authority, that the very aspect of the spot, even

at the present day, proves the agency of earth­

quakes and subterranean fires; this statement is not

confirmed by modern travellers: on the contrary,

Dr. Holland states that the peninsula ia, in part at

least, of primitive formation, and thia is eonf rmed

by Virlet (Expedition Scientijique de Moree, p.

37, 1839) in his general view of the geological

structure of continental Greece. (Daubeny, Vol­
