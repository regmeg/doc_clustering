the middle uf this wave there is a slight depression,

42(i.) A few additions to this graphic sketch of

the general geography of Palestine will suffice to

complete the description of its main features, and to

furnish a nomenclature for the more detailed notices

ivhich must follow. This addition will be best sup­

plied by the naturalist Iiussegger, whose travels

have furnished a desideratum in the geography of

Palestine. It will, however, bo more convenient to

consider below his third division of the country,

comprehending the river Jordan and the Dead Sea,

with its volcanic phaenomcnn, as those articles have

been reserved for this place, and the historical im­

portance of them demands a fuller account than is

given in his necessarily brief summary. He divides

th-1 country as follows: —

1. 'Die fruitful plain extending along the coast

from Gaza to Jung, north-east of Beirut.

2. The in'Umtain range separating this plain from

thi* valley of the Jordan, which, commencing with

Jtbtl Khniil, forms the rocky land of Judaea, Sa­

maria, and Galilee, and ends w ith the knot of moun­

tains trom which Libanus and Antilihanus extend

towards the north.

3. The valley of the Jordan, with the basins of

the hike of Tiberias and the Dead Sea, as far as

\Vrady-el-Gltor, the northern end of Wady-el-A raba.

4. The country on the cast of the Jordan, as far

as the parallel of Damascus.

(1.) The part of the coast plain extending

from the isthmus of Suez between the sea and the

mountains of Judaea and Samaria, and bounded by

the ridge of Carmel, belongs, in regard to its fer­

tility, to the moot beautiful regions of Syria. The

vegetation in all its forms is that of the warmer

parts of the shores of the Mediterranean; in the

southern districts the palm Bounties.

The mountains of Judaea and Samaria, which

rise to the height of 2000 feet above the sea, follow

the line of the plain until they meet the ridge of

Carmel. The coast district belongs partly to the older

and newer phoccuc of the marine deposits, and partly

to the chalk and Jura formations of the neighbour­

ing mountainous country.

I*o the north of Carmel the hilly arable land

occurs again.

Still further north, with the exception of a few

strips of land about Acre, Sur, Seida, Beirut, &c,

the coast plain becomes more and more narrowed by

the mountains, which extend towards the sea, until

there only remains here and there a very small strip

of coast.

Several mountain streams, swollen in the rainy

season to torrents, flow through deep narrow valleys

into the plain, in part fertilising it; in part, where

there are no harriers to oppose their force, spreading

devastation far and wide. Of these the principal

are Xahr-eJ-Kelb, Xahr-ed-Damur, the Auli, the

iSahnratit h, Xahr-el-Kusimith. Xtthr Mukuttu, Sec.

The mouutuin sides of Lebanon, trom Seida to

Beirut, arc cultivated in terraces; the principal

product of this kind of cultivation is the vine and

mulberry; the secondary, Jigs, oranges, pomegra­

nates, and, in general, the so-called tropical fruits.

The want of grass begins to show itself mSjrai

and especially on the sides of the promontory, o*ug

to the long continued drought*. The SyrianiM*

tains along the coast north of Carmel. and espc-iiiy

the sides of Lebanon, are, with the exception d Uf

garden-trees, and a tew scattered pica, asLtJ

devoid of wood.

(2.) The land immediately towards the •

which follows the line of coast from south to rr-*.«

at a distance now greater now less, rises in the t'rr.

of a lofty mountain chain, the summiu of

are for the most i<art rounded, ard rarriy [«i-J.

forming numerous plateaux, and inclndii 1 -j*

whole space between the coa*t on the west, WJ u*

valley of the Jordan, with the Dead Sea »i u*

lake of Tiberias, on the east, having sa ivenff

breadth of from 8 to 10 Gennan mile*.

This mountain chain commences in the

with Jebel Khalil, which, towards the «*4 ^

south-west, stretches to the plum of Gaza isal*

sandy deserts of the isthmus, and towards tie >

and south-east joins the mountain count*? id A»

bia Petraea, and towards the e.ist sinks wrlrt*4

into the basin of the Dead Sea. Immediately

to Jebel Khniil are Jebei-d-Kod* and the n^ui

tains of K phi aim, sinking on the east in--' u

valley of the Jordan, and on the west into th( t —

tending to the sea. and forming the pcwD0HU*"i

Carmel. North of Mcrj Jbn 'A rnir are the mou^:*

of Galilee, Hennon, Tabor, Jebcl Sa/td, Saron. *

This group sinks into the basin of the lake ot 1c

lias and the upper valley of the Jordan, an the «

on the west into the coast district of Acre ax** >

extends into the sea in several promontories, a^

united to the chain of Lebanon at Scida. by -

and of Uasbeia to Jtbtl-e$*Skeickt or JUxi-<ir f

and thus to the chain of Antilibanus,

described belongs to the Jura, and chalk funasfl
