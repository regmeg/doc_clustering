LYRBE. 231 LYSIMACHIA.

extracted from Polybius, as well as from the Itine­

raries, it would appear tliat Lyncestis comprehended

that part of Upper Macedonia now called Filuvina,

and all the S. part of the basin of the Ebigon,

with its branches, the Bevus and Osphagls. As

il is stated that the first encampment of the Romans

was at Lracus on the river Bevos, and as Lyncus

is described as a town by Stephanos B. (though his

description is evidently incorrect), it might be sup­

posed that Hekacleia, the chief town of this district,

was sometimes called Lyncus, and that the camp of

Sulpicius, was at fleracleia itself. But though the

words '' ad Lyncum stativa posuit prope flumen

Bevum" (Liv. I. c.) seem to point to this identifi­

cation, yet it is more likely that Lyncus is here used

as synonymous wiih Lyncestis, as in two other pas-

»ajes of Livy (xxvi. 25, xxxii. 9), and in Thu-

cydides (iv. 83, 124) and Plutarch. (Flamin. 4.)

At or near lituiitza are the mineral acidulous

waters of Lyncestis, which were supposed by the

ancients to possess intoxicating qualities. (Ov.

Mit. xv. 329; comp. Arist. Meteor, ii. 3; Theo-

pump. ap. Plin. ii. 103, xxxi. 2, ap. Antig. Caryst.

ISO, ap. Sotion. de Flum. p. 125; Vitruv. viii. 3;

Sen. Uuatst. iVaf. iii. 20.) They were found by

Dr. Bruwu (Travels in Ilungaria, Macedonia, Tfies-

saly, dt dr., Lond. 1673, p. 45) on the road from

FUvrina to Egri Budja. He calls the place Ec-

asso Yerbeni; this, which sounds Wallachian, may

possibly be a corruption of the name of the Derceni

or pass. (Leake, AoriAern Greece, vol. iii. pp.

305—318.) [E. B. J.]

LYRBE (AvpS-n: Eth. AvpStiTns), a town of

Piskiia, uienlioned by the poet Dionysius. There

are coins of this place belonging to the reign of

Ak-xander Severus, and it occurs among the epi­

scopal towns of Pamphylia in the Not. Eccles. It is

clearly the same as the Lyrope (At/fKiirjj) of

I't'Jemy, though he places the latter in Cilicia

Tracheia. (Dionys. Per. 858; Hierocl. p. 682;

PloJ. v.5. § 9; Cramer, Asia Minor, vol.ii. p. 313.)

LYRCE1A or LYRCEIUM (h Aopxeio, Paus.;

AvfMHiov, Soph. ap. Strab. vi. p. 271 ;,in Strab. viii. p.

376, AvKovpyiov is a false reading for fivpntiov, see

Kramer's Strab. vol. ii. p. 186), a town intlieArgeia,

distant 60 stadia from Argots, and 60 stadia from Or-

neae, and situated on the road Climax, which can from

Argus in a north-westerlydirection along the bed of the

luacbus. [AkooS, p. 201. j '1 lie town is said to liave

bees originally called Lynceiu, and to have obtained

this name from Lyuceus, who fled hither when all

bis other brothers, the sons of Aegyptus, were mur-

drred by the daughters of Danaus on their wedding

night. He gave intelligence of his safe arrival in

this place to his faithful wife Hypennnestra, by

holding up a torch; and she in like manner informed

Lim of her safety by raising a torch from Larissa,

the citadel 'if Argos. The name of the town was

afterwards changed into Lyrceia from Lyrcus, a son

of Abas. It was in ruins in the time of Pausanias.

Its remains may still be seen on a small elevation

en the left of the Inachus, at a little distance beyond

blma, on the road to Argus. (Paus. ii 25. §§ 4,5;

Apoliui. ii. 1. § 5 ; Strab. /. c.; Ross, Retten im

J'llupomtt, p. 138; Boblaye, Rccherches, cfc. p.

45; Leake, Morea, vol. ii. p. 414; Curtius, JJeli>-

pmmetns, vol. ii. p. 415.)

LYRXAS. fLyiuiessus, 2.]

LYRXE6SUS (\uprnoa6s: Eth. AupHjwiot or

A»f»moj, Aeschyl. rers. 324). 1. A town often

B-.uui.ced by Homer (//. ii. 690, xix. 60, xj. 92,

191), and described by Stephanus B. (s. v.) as one

of the eleven towns in Troas ; and Strabo (xiii. p.

612) mentions that it was situated in the territory

of Thcbe, but that afterwards it belonged to

Adramyttium. Pliny (v. 32) places it on the

river Evenus, near its sources. It was, like Thcbe,

a deserted place as early as the time of Strabu.

(Comp. Strab. xiii. p. 584; Diod. v. 49.) About

4 miles from Karavdren, Sir C. Fellows (Journ.

of an Exc. in Asia Minor, p. 39) found several

columns and old walls of good masonry; which ho

is inclined to regard as remnants of the ancient Ly r-

nessus.

2. A place on the coast of Pamphylia, which wa_s

reported to have been founded there by the Trojan

Cilicians, who transferred the name of the Trojan

Lyrnessus to this new settlement (Strab. xiv. 670.)

The town is also mentioned by Pliny (v. 26), who

places it on the Catarrhactes, and by Dionysius

Periegctes (875). The Stadiasmus Maris Macini

(§ 204) calls it Lyrnas, and, according to the

French translators of Strabo (vol. iii. pt. 2. p. 363),

its site is identical with the modem Ernatia.

3. An ancient name of the island of Tenedos.

(Plin. v. 39.) [L. S.]

LY'ROPE. [Lyrbe.]

LY'SIAS (Aoffids: Eth. Awio%7s), a small town

in Phrygia, between Synnada and Prymnessiis.

(Strab. xii. p. 576; Plin. v. 29 ; Ptol. v. 2. § 23;

Hierocl. p. G77.) No particulars are known about

the place, nor is its site ascertained, but we still

possess coins of Lysias. (Eckhel, Doctr. Num. iii.

p. 167.) [L. S.]

LYSIMACHIA (Aucnuaxfa or Avaifxiy^tta).

1. A small town in Mysia, mentioned only by Pliny

(v. 22), in whose time it no longer existed.

2. An important town on the north-eastern ex­

tremity of the Thracian Chersoncsus, not far from

the Sinus Melas. It was built by Lysimachus in

b. c. 309, when he was preparing for the last

struggle with his rivals; for the new city, being

situated on the isthmus, commanded the road from

Sestos to the north and the mainland of Thrace.

In order to obtain inhabitants for his new city,

Lysimachus destroyed the neighbouring town of

Cardia, the birthplace of the historian Hieronymus.

(Strab. ii. p. 134, vii. p. 331; Paus. i. 9. § 10; Diod.

xx. 29; Polyb. v. 34; Tlin. II. N. iv. 18.) Ly.-i-

marhus no doubt made Lysimachia the capital of his

kingdom, and it must have rapidly risen to great

splendour and prosperity. After his death the city

fell under the dominion of Syria, and during the

wars between Scleucus Callinicus and Ptolemy Euer-

getes it passed from the hands of the Syrians into

those of the Egyptians. Whether these latter set

the town free, or whether it emancipated itself, is

uncertain, at any rate it entered into the relation of

sympolity with the Aetolians. But as the Aetolians

were not able to afford it the necessary protection, it

was destroyed by the Thracians during the war of

the Romans against Philip of Macedonia. Antiochus

the Great restored the place, collected the scattered

and enslaved inhabitants, and attracted colonists

from all parts by liberal promises. (Liv. xxxiii. 38,

40; Diod. Exc. de Yirt. et lit. p. 574.) This resto­

ration, however, appears to have been unsuccessful,

and under the dominion of Rome it decayed more

and more. The last time the place is mentioned

under its ancient name, is in a passage of Ammianus

Marcellinus (xxii. 8). The emperor Justinian re­

stored it and surrounded it with strong fortifications
