M'U (L c.) it was the richest town on that coast,

I Mrabi (L c.) represents its population as equal

i/uf of Carthago Nora. Its fertile plain and

.-t chores are celebrated by Martial and other

'->: and its neighbourhood is described as pro-

Vastus. But Tarraco, like most other ancient

wiew that point the province of Lusitania; and

» S, the province of Lusitania and the province

Kara, the boundaries of which have been already

jwn. (Mela, ii. 6; comp. Strab. iii. p. 166; Plin.

I. V 35; Martian, p. 34.) Thus it embraced

Dudcnt provinces of J/wrcsa, Valencia, Cata-

. Amgon, Satarrt, Litcay, Atturial, Calli-

do, the N. part of Portugal as far down as the

/hnro, the N. ]>art of Leon, nearly all the CattUtB,

and part of Andalutia. The nature of its climate

and productions may be gathered from what has been

already said [HtsPANiA, Vol. I. p. 1086.] A sum­

mary of the different tribes, according to the various

authorities that have treated upon the subject, hat

also been given in the same article [p. 1083], as

well as the particulars respecting its government

and administration [p. 1081.] [T. H. D.]

TARRAGA (Tdftaya, Ptol. ii. 6. § 67), called

by the Geogr. Rav. (iv. 43) Tkriiacha, a town

of the Vascones in Hispania Tarraconensis (Plin.

iii. 3. s. 4). Now Larraga. (Cf. Cellariua, Orb.

Ant i. p. 91.) [T. H. D]

TARRHA (Tifba, Pausan. ix. 16. § 13; Theo-

phraat. U. P. ii. 2; Stcph. B. t. v.: One. ap. Euieb.

P. E. p. 133, ed. Stephan.; Tdp>», Stadiatm.

§§ 329, 330). a town on the SYV. coast of Crete

between Phoenice and Poecilassus, one of the earliest

sites of the Apollo-worship, and the native country

of the writer Lucillus. For Tarba (TapSa, Ptol. iii.

17. § 3) Meursius proposes to read Tarrha There

can be little or no doubt that its position should be

fixed on the SW. coast of the island, at the very

entrance of tire glen of liughia Rumtli, where the

bold hanging mountains hem in the rocky bed of the

river. (Pashley, Trarelt, vol. ii. p. 270). The

Florentine traveller Buondelmonti, who visited Crete

A. rx 1415, describes considerable remains of a

temple and other buildings as existing on the site of

the ancient city («p. Corneliiu, Creia Sacra, vol. i.

p. 85). [E. B. J ]

TARSATICA (TcuMrdriira, Ptol. ii. 17. § 2),

called in the J tin. Ant. p. 273, Tharsaticum, a place

in lllyricunt, on the road from Aquileia to Siscia

through Liburnia, now Tertat, to the E. of /turn*.

(Cf. Pliny, iii. 21. s. 25; Tab. Pent.) [T. H. D.]

TAR.SHISH. [Taktkssih.]

TA'RSIA (Tapoir;, Arrian, Ind. c. 37), a pro­

montory on the coast of Carmania, visited by the

fleet of Nearchus. The conjecture of Vincent ( Voy­

age of Xearchut, i. p. 362) that it is represented

by the present Kat-al-Ojerd appears well founded.

It is perhaps the same as the Themisteas Promon-

torium of Pliny (vi. 25) as suggested by Miiller

(Geoy. Grate, i. p. 360.) [V.]

TA'KMUM (Td><no»-, Ptol. ii. 16. § 8), a place

in Pannonia Inferior, now Tertaa. [T. Ii. I>.]

TAUMUS (Tdpo-101), a river of Mysia in the

neighbourhood of the town of Zeleia, which had its

source in Mount Temntis, and flowed in a north*

eastern direction through the lake of Miletopolis,

and, issuing from it, continued its north-eastern

course till it joined the Macestua. (Strab. xiii. p.

p. 587.) Strabo indeed states that the river flowed

in numerous windings not far from Zeleia; but he

can scarcely mean any other river than the one now

bearing the name HaKkeiri, and which the Turks

still call Tana. Hamilton (Ketearchet, vol. ii. p,

106) identifies it with the Kara So or Kara Den

Su, which flows into SAike Maniyas. [L. S.]

TARSU'RAS (Tapoovpar, Arrian, Per. P. Km.

p. 10), a river of Colchis falling into the sea be­

tween theSingames and the Hippus. (Cf. Plin. vi.

4. a. 4.) It is probably the same river called Tas-

tiaros in the Tab. Pent. [T. H. D.l

TARSUS (TcuxriSj: Eth. Tapo-ririt or T-uxnui).

sometimes also called Tarsi (Topo-of), Tersns Tep-
