ZITHA, or ZEITHA (Z«/9a, Ptol. t. 18. § 6), a

400 stadia long, with a town of the same name upon

it, in Libya, not far from the Lesser Syrtis. Stephanus

B. (p. 290) mentions only the town, which, accotd-

Ptolemy (iv. 3. § 41.) [T. U. D.J

ZUGAR (Zo*yof, Ptol. iv. 3. § 40), a town of

Africa Propria, between the rivers Uagradas and

ZYGANTIS (ZiryojTd, Hecat. Fr. ap. Steph. B.

p. 290), a town of Libya, whose inhabitants were

noted for their preparation of honey. Hence Klausen

(ad Uecat. p. 134) identifies them with the Gyzantes

Tritonis, of whom that historian relates the same

thing. [T. H. D.]

adapted (cf. Id. ii. 129, xi. 492. xvii. 839). Ste­

phanus B. (p. 290) says that they also bore the

(Zvywt) in Dionysiua (Perieg. 687) and Avientis

(Ottcrip. Orb. 871). [T. H. D.]

ZYGOPOI.IS (SiryowoAu, Strab. xii. p. 548), a

town in Pontus, in the neighbourhood of Colchis.

Stephanus B. (p. 290) conjectures that It was in the

with Strabo'a description. [T. H. D.j

ZYGRIS (Zvyplv, Ptol. iv. 5. § 4), a village
