pie of Apollo, and another of Aphrodite, which two

ZEUGITANA KEGIO, the more northern part

of the Roman province of Africa. Pliny Menu to

l>e the earliest writer who mentions the name of

Zeugitana(r, 4. s. 3). A town of Zeugis is mentioned

by Aethicus (Cosmogr. p. (1.1). and a Zengitanns, ap­

parently a mountain, by Solinus ("a pede Zeugi-

tano," c. 27), which is perhaps the same as the

Moos Ziguensis of Victor (de Persec. Vandal, iii.),

the present Zow-vxm; and according to Shaw

(Travels, i. p. 191, sq.), if the existence of a town

or mountain so named is not altogether problema­

tical, the province probably derived its name from

either one or the other. The district was bounded on

the S. by Byzacium, on the W. by Numidia, from

which it was divided by the liver Tusca (now Zaine),

and on the N. and E. by the Mare Internum. After

the time of Caesar it appears to have been called

Provincia Vetus, or Africa Propria, as opposed to

the later acquired Numidia. (Dion Cass, xliii. 10;

Plin. /. c.; Mela, i. 7.) Strabo mentions it only as

ri Kapx^SoWa, or the province of Carthage (vi. p.

267, &c). It embraced the modern Frigeah (which

is doubtless a corruption of the ancient name of Af­

rica) or northern part of the kingdom of Tunis.

Zeugitana was watered by the Bagradas, and was a

very fertile country. There were no towns of im­

portance iti the interior, but on the coast we find

Siagul, Neapolis, Gnrubis, Aspis or Clupea, Carpis,

Tunes, Carthago, Castra Cornelia, Utica, and Hippo

Diarrhytus. For further particulars concerning this

province see Africa. [T. H. D.]

ZEUGMA. L. (ScGy/ta, Ptol. v. 15. § 14), a

town founded by Seleucus Nicator, in the province

of Cyrrhestica, in .Syria. It derived its name from

n bridge of boats which was here laid across the

Euphrates, and which in the course of time became

the sole passage over the river, when the older one

at Thapsacus, 2000 stadia to the S., had become

impracticable, or at all events very dangerous, owing

to the spreading of the Arabian hordes. (Plin. v. 24.

s. 21; Strab. xvi. p. 746; Steph. B. s. v.) Zeugma

lay on the right bank ot the Euphrates, opposite to

Apamea, 72 miles S\Y. of tanosata, 175 miles NE.

of the maritime. Seleucia, and 30" miles N. of Hiera-

polis. (Plin. / c, and v. 12. s. 13 ; Strab. xvi. p.

749; Tab. J'tut.) It was therefore opposite to the

modern Bir or ifiredsjik, which occupies the site of

the ancient Apamea. (Cf. Kilter. Erdkunde, x. p.

944, seq.) In the time of Justinian, Zeugma had

fallen into decay, but was restored by that emperor.
