and thus harmonises with the natural derivation of

the word. In the plain which extends along the

base lit" the mountains eastwards towards the city,

Koss says that there are traces of ancient channels

made for the purpose of irrigation. He regards the

marshy places near the temple to be the KdX.afj.oi

and the"EAo? mentioned by Athcnaeus (xiii.p. 572)

iu connection with the expedition of Pericles. (The

former place is likewise referred to by Herodotus, ix.

96.) Across this plain, which is about two miles in

length, there is no doubt that a Sacred Way extended

from the sanctuary to the city, like that which

connected Athens with Eleusis. Somewhere on this

line (koto r^v bhhv tt]v tls to 'Rpaiov, Pans. vii. 5.

§ 6) was the tomb of Khadine and Leontichus,

where lovers used to make their vows; and traces of

funeral monuments are still seen at the extremity of

the line, close to the city-wall.

The modern town of Chora, close to the pass lead­

ing through the mountains toVathij, is near the place

of the ancient city, which was situated partly in the

plain and partly on the slope of the hill. The

western wall runs in a straight line from the moun­

tain towards the sea, with the exception of a bend

inwards near the tombs just mentioned. Here is a

brackish stream yKvtpdb'a), which is the Cliesius,

the second of the three streams mentioned by Pliny.

(See Etyin. Magn. $.v. 'Ao~Tvira\aia.) The southern

wall dt«s not touch the sea in all its length, and is

strengthened by being raised on vaulted substruc­

tions. Here and elsewhere the ruins of Samos touch

the question of the use of the arch among the

(Ireeks. On the east side of the city the walls are

very considerable, being 10 or 12 feet thick, and

about 18 feet high. The masonry is partly qua­

drangular ami partly polygonal; there are round

towers at intervals on the outside of the wall, and

in one place are traces of a gate. In the eastern

part of the city was the steep citadel of Astypalaea,

which was fortified by Polycrates (Polyaen. Strat. i.

23. 2), and here probably was what Suetonius

calls the palace of Polycrates. (Suet. Calig. 21.)

In the higher part of the town the theatre is dis­

tinctly visible; the marble heats are removed; un­

derneath is a large cistern. The general area is

covered with small fragments, many of the best

having furnished materials for the modem castle of

Lycurgus near the shore on the SE.; and little

more remains of a city which Herodotus says was,

under Polycrates, the greatest of cities, Hellenic or

Barbarian, and which, in the time of comparative

decay, is still called by Horace Conciwta Santos.

Herodotus makes especial mention of the harlKuir

and of an immense tunnel which formed an aque­

duct for the city. The former of these works (to

Ttydvi, its it is now called, from being shaped like a

frying-pan) is below Astypalaea; and, though it is

now accessible only to small craft, its famous moles

remain, one extending eastwards from the castle of

Lyenrgns, the other extending to meet it from the

extremity of tiie east city-wall southwards. Here

Koss saw subterranean jvissage^ hewn in the rock,

one of which may possibly be the KpvirT^ hiuspv^

itc tt)s owpoTT^Aeoy <i>(povia 4ir\ &d\ao(rav (Herod,

iii. 146), constructed by Maeandrius after the death

of Polycrates. The tunnel has not been clearly

identified; but, from what M. Musurus told Prof.

Iioss, it is probable that it is where Touniefort

placed it, and that it penetrated the hill from Mete-

ILiwwt to Chora, and that thence the water was taken

into the city by a covered channel, traces of which re­

main. It is clear that it cannot be iu ?h? -^itt
