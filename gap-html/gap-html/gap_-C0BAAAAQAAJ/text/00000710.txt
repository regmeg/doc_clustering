branch of it turning to the north-west, and by the

mountains containing the sources of the Macander,

l»ore tJie surname Pauohios; it was a table-land,

but, to judge from the many towns it contained, it

cannot huve been as barren as the northern plateau.

In the west Phrygia comprised the upper valley of

the Maeauder, and it is there that we find the moat

beautiful and most populous parts of Phrygia; but

that district was much exposed to earthquakes in

consequence of the volcanic nature of the district,

which is attested by the hot-springs of Hicrapolis,

and the Plutonium, from which suffocating exha­

lations were sent forth. (Claudian, in Eulrop. ii.

270, ate.; Strab. xii. pp. 578, &c, 629, &c; Herod,

vii. .'id; Vitruv. viii. 3.)

Phrygia was :i country rich in every kind of pro­

duce. Its mountains seem to have furnished gold;

for thai metal plays an important part in the legends

of Midas, and several of the Phrygian rivers are called

"aurderi." (Claudian, /. r. 258.) Phrygian mar-

hie, especially the species found near Synnada, was

very celebrated. (Strab. xii. p. 579: Paus. i. 1H.

§ 8, &c.; Ov\ Fast. v. 529; Stat. Silr. i. 5. 36.)

The extensive cultivation of the vine is clear from

the worship of Dionysus (Sabazius), and Homer (//.

iii. 184) also gives to the country the attribute

aLtirtK.nrrffa. The parti most distinguished tor

their excellent wine, however, were subsequently

separated from Phryzia and added to neighbouring

provinces. lint Phrygia was most distinguished fur

its sheep and the fineness of their wool (Strab. xii.

p. 578). King Amyntas is said to have kept no less

than 300 flocks of sheep on the barren table-land,

whence we must infer that sheep-breeding was ear­

ned on there on a very large scale. (Comp. Suid.

s. v. ^.-vyiotv ipl(dv\ Aristoph. .1/', 403; Strab. /. c.

p. 568.)

When Alexander had overthrown the Persian

power in Asia Minor, he assigned Great Phrygia to

Antigonus, B.C. 333 (Arrian, Anab. i. 29); and

during the first division of Alexander's empire that

general retained Phryiria. to which were added Lycia

and Pamphvha, while Leonnatus obtained Lesser

Phrygia. (Dexipp. ap. Phot. p. 04; Curt. x. 10;

I)n«J. xviii. 3; Justin, xiii. -1.) In the beginning

of H.r. 321, Perdiccas assigned Greater Phrygia.

and probably also the Lesser, to Eumenes(Justin, xiii.

6; Com. Nep. Eum. 3); but in the new division of

Triparadisus Antigonus recovered his fonrier pro­

vinces, and Arrhidaeus obtained Lesser Phrygia,

which, however, was taken from hint by Antigonus

as early as n.c. 319. (Diod. xviii. 39, xix. 51,

52. 75; Arrian, ap. Phot. p. 72.) After the death

of Antigonus, in n. c. 301, Lesser Phrygia fell into

the hands of Lysimaehus, and Great Phrygia into

those of Seleucus (Appian, Ayr. 55), who, after con­

quering Lysimaclius, in B.C. 2S2, united the two

Phrygias with the Syrian empire. (Appian, Syr.

62 ; Justin, xvii. 2 ; Memnon, Hist. Nerarl. <J.)

Soon two other kingdoms, Bithynia and Pergamum,

were formed in the vicinity of Phrygia, and the

Gauls or Galatae, the most dangerous enemy of the

Asiatics, tiMik permanent possession of the north­

eastern part of Phrygia, the valley of the Sangarius,

Thus was formed Galatia, which in our maps sepa­

rates Greater Phrygia from Paphlagonia and Llithy-

nia; and the ancient towns of Gordium, Ancyra, and

l'e Minis now became the seats of the Gauls. To

the east also Phrygia lost a [tortion of its territory,

tor Lycaonia was extended so far westward as to

embrace the whole of the above mentioned barren

plateau. (Strab. xiv. p. 663.) It h BPtW]
