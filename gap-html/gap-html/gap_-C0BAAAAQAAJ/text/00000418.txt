mouth, for a distance of 80 stadia up to its "em­

porium" now Fort 0\nte, where there are some

vestiges of Roman buildings. The Manii occupied

this district. In the interior was a vast lake, ex­

tending to the Aitakiatak. A fertile island of

180 stadia in circuit was in the lake (Pallida Utovo,

or Pvporo). From this lake the river flowed, at a

distance of one day's sail from the river Arion

('Aoiuu', Scylax, /. c.: Orublit; comp. Pouqucvllle,

Voyage dtnis la Gri'ce, vol. i. p. 25.) This river

formed the S. boundary of Dalmatia, and its banks

were occupied by the Daorezi, Ardiaei and, Paraei.

(Strab. vii. pp. 315, 317.) These banks were

iiimous in former times among tho professors of

pharmacy, who are advised by Nicander (Theriaca,

v. 607) to gather the "Iris" there. (I'lin. xiii. 2,

xxi. 19; Theophr. ap. Athen.xv. p. 681.) .Strabo (vii.

p. 317) rejects the statement of Theopoinpus that

the potters' clay of Chios and Thasos was found in

the bed of tho river, r'or the valley of the Narenta,

NAKO'NA (Napfiivo, a mistake fur Nopwi a, Ptol.

ii. 17. § 12, viii. 7. § 8), a town in Dalmatia, and a

Roman "colonia." It appears from the letters of P.

Vatinius to Cicero (ad Fam. v. 9, 10), dated Narona,

that the Romans made it their head-quarters dur­

ing their conquest of Dalmatia. (Comp l'omp. Mela,

ii. 3. § 13; I tin. Anton.; Pent. Tab.; Geog. Rav.

iv. 16.) Narona was a "conventus." at which,

according to M. Vatro (ap Plin. iii. 26) 89 cities

assembled; in the time of l'liny (I. c.) this number

had diminished, but he speaks of as many as 540

"decuriae" submitting to its jurisdiction.

The ancient city stood upon a hill now occupied

by the village of Vido, and extended proliably to tbo

marsh below; from the very numerous inscriptions

that have been found there, it appears that there

was a temple to Liber and Libera, as well as other

buildings dedicated to Jupiter and Diana. (Lanza,

sopra lantira cittd di Xarona, Bologna, 1842;

Neigebaur, />«* Sud-Slaven, pp. 116, 122.) A coin

of Titus lias been found with the epigraph Col.

Narona. (Gull*, Thesaurus, p. 241 ; Kaschc, vol.

iii. pt. i. p. 1048.)

When the Serbs or W. Slaves occupied this

country in the reign of Heraclius, Narenta, as it

was called, was one of the four " banats " into which

the Servians were divided. The Narentine pirates,

who for three centuries had been the terror of Dal­

matia and the Venetian tracers, were in A. D. 997

entirely crushed by the fleet of Venice, commanded

by the Doge in person. (Schafarik, Slat'. Alt. vol. ii.

the name of a city and mountain of l'lithiotis in

Theualy, in the neighbourhood of which Agesilau-s,

on his return from Asia in n. c. 394, gained a

victory over the Thessalian cavalry. The Thes-

xnlians, after their defeat, took refuge on Mount

Narthacium, between which and a place named

Pros, Agexilaus set up a trophy. On the follow­

ing day he crossed the mountains of the Achaean

1'hthiolis. (Xen. Hell. iv. 3. §§ 3—9; Ages. 2.

§§ 3—5; Pint. Apvp/ith. p. 211; Diod. xiv. 82.)

Narthacium is accordingly placed by Leake and

Kicpert south of Pharsalus in the valley of the

Enipeus ; and the mountain of this name is probably

the one which rises immediately to the southward of

Ftrtola. Leake supposes the town of Narthacium

to have bean on the mountain not far from upper

Tjaterli, and Pras near lower TjaterU. (SorOurm

Greece, vol. iv. p. 471, scq.) The town Xartbaciam

is mentioned by Ptolemy (iii. 13. § 46), and should

probably be restored in a passage of Strata (ix.

p. 434), where in the MS. there is only the ter­

mination loc. (See Gruskurd and Kramer,

with Leake that Naryx was near the frootief of

l'hocis. (Diod. xiv. 82.) In 352 Xaryx was talus

by Phayllus, the Phocian commander. (Diod. xvi.

38.) It is placed by some at Talanda, bat by

Leake at the small village of Kalapodhi, where there

arc a few ancient remains. (Northern Gretas, voL n.

cording to some of the ancients, a colony of Xaryx

B. #. r.) were, according to Herodotus, the most

powerful of the Nomadic tribes on the northern cost

of Libya. -There is some discrepancy in hi* ac­

count of their situation, as well as in those of otbar

ancient writers. (Comp. ii. 32, iv. 172.) They

appear, however, to have occupied at one time part

of Cyrenaica and the Syrtes. Strabo (xvii. p. 857)

places them at the Greater Syrtis, and beyond thrxa

tile Psylli, whoseterritory, according to both Herod. <a»

and Strabo, they appropriated to themselves. Pliny

(v. 5. s. 5) says that the Nasamoncs were originally

named Mesamones by the Greeks, because tbey dwelt

between two quicksands—the Syrtes. Ptolemy (iv. 5.

§ 21) and Diodorus (iii. 3) again remove theui to tLe

inland region of Augila: and all these description*

may, at the time they were « ritlen, have hero near the

truth; since notonly were the Nasamunes, as Xouia<ie>,

a wandering race, but they were also prosed upon by

the Greeks of Cyrene, on the one side, and by the

Carthaginians, on the other. For when, at a lawr

period, the boundaries of Carthage and the Rapo

Cyrenaica touched at the I'hileliian Altars, whack

were situated in the inmost recesses of the Syrtea, ix

is evident that the Nasatnones must have been dis­

placed from a tract which at one time brimmed la

tliem. When at its greatest extent, their territory.

including the lands of the Psylli and the oaus ef

Augila, most have reached inland and along the

shore of the Mediterranean about 4CMJ gn<raphical
