NEAPOLIS.

411 NEAPOLIS.

Ok gulf of Oriftano. The Itineraries place it 60

miks from Sulci, and 18 from Othoca (Oristano).

(/ha. Ant. p. 84.) The name would clearly seem

to pint to a Greek origin, but we have no account

of its foundation or history. It is noticed by Pliny

■ one of the most important towns in Sardinia; and

its name is found also in Ptolemy and the Itinera­

ries. (Pirn, hi. 7. s. 13; Ptol. iii. 3. § 2; ten.

Ant. I c; Tab. Peat.; Geogr. Eav. v. 26.) Its

rains are still visible at the mouth of the river Pa-

btikxii, where that stream forms a great estuary or

lis,i)on, called the Stagno di Marceddi, and present

cvitsulerable remains of ancient bnildings as well as

the vestiges of a Roman road and aqueduct. The

spot is marked by an ancient church called Sta

ilaria di Xabui. (De la Marmora, Voy. en Sar-

imqnt, voL ii. p. 357.)

The Aquae Neapoutanae, mentioned by Pto­

lemy u well as in the Itinerary, which places them

at a considerable distance inland, on the road from

Othoca to Caralis, are certainly the mineral sources

bow known as the Bayni di Sardara, on the high­

road from Cagliari to Oristano. (Itin. Ant. p. 82;

Pud. iii. 3. § 7; Geogr. Kav. v. 26; De la Marmora,

L c p. 406.)

3. A city of Apulia, not mentioned by any ancient

writer, but the existence of which is attested by its

alias. There seems good reason to place it at

/Wiysano, between Barium and Egnatia, where

numerous relics of antiquity have been discovered

(Kumanelli, vol. ii. p. 148—152; Millingen, A'umiam.

<k (Italic, p. 147.) [E. H. B.]

4. A town on the isthmus of Pallene, on the E.

«a«t, between Aphytis and Aege. (Herod, vii. 123.)

In Leake's map it is represented by the modern

Pttykhrono.

5. A town of Macedonia, and the haven of Phi-

lippi.from which it was distant 10 M. P. (Strab. vii.

p. 330; PtoL iii. 13. §9; Scymn. 685; Plin. iv.

11; Hierocl.; Procop. Aed. iv. 4; /(in. Hieroiol.)

It probably was the same place as Datum (Aotov),

hmnoa for its gold-mines (Herod, is. 75; comp.

B«±a,/>«o. A'con. of A them, pp. 8,228, trans.), and a

seaport, u Strabo (vii. p. 331) intimates: whence the

proverb which celebrates Datum for its " good things."

(Zenob. Prov. Grate. Cent. iii. 71; Harpocrat. s. v.

Airsi.) Scylax (p. 27) does, indeed, distinguish

between Neapolis and Datum; but, as he adds that

the latter was an Athenian colony, which could not

have been true of his original Datum, his text is,

prrbaps, corrupt in this place, as in so many others,

and ins real meaning may have been that Neapolis

•as a colony which the Athenians had established

at Datum. Zenobius ('. c.) and Eustathius (ad

iMMft. Periej. 517) both assert that Datum was a

eohjoy of Tbasos; which is highly probable, as the

Thasiang had several colonies on this coast. If

Keapolis was a settlement of Athens, its foundation

wis, it may be inferred, later than that of Amphi-

poSa. At the great struggle at Philippi the galleys

<rf Brotus and Cassius were moored off Neapolis.

(Appian, B. C. iv. 106; Dion Cass, xlvii. 35.)

It was at Neapolis, now the small Turkish village

of A'amifo (Leake, North. Greece, vol. iii. p. 180,

cmp. pp. 217, 224), that Paul (Act>, xvi. 11)

lauded. The shore of the mainland in this part is

km, but the mountains rise to a considerable height

b»liiud. To the W. of the channel which separates it

from Tbasos, the coast recedes and forms a bay,

within which, on a promontory with a port on each

ude, the town was situated. (Conyhcare and Howson,

Life and Epist. of SU Paul, vol. i. p. 308.) Traces

of paved military roads are still found, as well as

remains of a great aqueduct on two tiers of Roman

arches, and Latin inscriptions. (Clarke, Trav.

vol. viii. p. 49.) For coins of Neapolis, see Eckhel,

vol ii. p. 72; Rasche, vol. iii. pt. i. p. 1149.

6. A town of the Tanric Chersonesus, and a

fortress of Scilurus. (Strab. vii. p. 312; Bockh,

Inter, vol. ii. p. 147.) Dubois de Montpcrreux

( Voyage A utour da Caucase, vol. v. p. 389, vol. vi. pp.

220,378) has identified this place with the ruins

found at Kermentchik near Simplieropol. [E. B. J.]

NEAPOLIS. II. In Asia. 1. An important

city of Palaestine, commonly supposed to be identical

with the Sichem or Shechem of the Old Testament.

Thus Epiphanius uses the names as synonymous

(iv Suciuuis. toot' Io-tiv iv Tp wv\ NeowdXei, adv.

Haeres. lib. iii. torn. i. p. 1055, comp. 1068). Eusebius

and St. Jerome, however, place Sichem (2utfjaa,

2u»tfu, 2ux«m) in the suburbs of Neapolis (Onomast.

s. w. Teret/inthus, Sychem); and Luz is placed near

to, and, according to the former, viii. M. P., according

to the latter, iii. M. P., from Neapolis (s. v. Aoufa),

which would imply a considerable interval between

the ancient and the modern city. In order to re­

concile this discrepancy, Reland suggests that, while

the ancient city gradually decayed, the new city was

extended by gradual accretion in the opposite direc­

tion, so as to widen the interval ; and he cites in

illustration the parallel case of Utrecht and Veehten.

(Palaestina, pp. 1004, 1005,) Another ancient

name of this city occurs only in one passage of

St. John's Gospel (iv. 5), where it is called Sichar

(2ixap); for although St. Jerome maintains this to

be a corrupt reading for Sychem (Epitaph. Pauhie,

Ep. lxxxvi. Op. torn. iv. p. 676, Quaest. in Genes.

c xlviii. ver. 22, torn ii. p. 545), his correction of

what he allows was an ancient and common error,

even in his age, has no authority in any known codex

or version. Another of its ancient names which has

exercised the ingenuity of the learned, occurs in

Pliny, who reckons among the cities of Samaria,

"Neapolis quod antea Mamortha dicebatur" (v. 13),

evidently a mistake for Mabortha, which Josephus

gives for the native name of Neapolis (B. J. iv. 8.

§ 2); unless, as Reland conjectures, both readings

are to be corrected from coins, which he shrewdly re­

marks are less liable to corruption than MSS., and

which read Morthia (Mopfl(a), which that learned

writer takes to be the classical form of the Hebrew

word Moreh, which was associated with Sichem, both

in the Old Testament and the Rabbinical commen­

taries. (Gen. xii. 6; Deut. xi. 30; Reland, IHsser-

tationes Miscell. ]»ira L pp. 138—140.) The same

writer explains the name Sichar, in St John, as a

name of reproach, contemptuously assigned to the

city by the Jews as the Beat of error (the Hebrew

TJS?' signifying mendacium, falsuni), and borrowed

from the prophet Uabakkuk, where the two words

Moreh Shaker (~\ffi iTJJD) occur in convenient
