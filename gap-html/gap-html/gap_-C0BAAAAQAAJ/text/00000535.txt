P* c it Caesar had made Noviodunum, which

^ » dtpdt (B. G. rii. 55). He had his

■ earn, his military chest, with the

a a Ailswed bin) frotn borne for the war, his

own and his army's baggage, and a great number of

horses which had been bought for him in Spain and

Italy. After his failure before Gergovia, the Aeriui

at Noviodunum massacred those who were there to

look after stores, the negotiatores. and the travellers

who were in the place. They divided the money

among them and the horses, carried off in boats all

the corn that they could, and burnt the rest or

threw it into the river. Thinking they could not

hold the town, they burnt it. It was a regular

Gallic outbreak, performed in its true national style.

Tiiis was a great loss to Caesar - and it may seem

that he was imprudent in leaving such great stores

in the power of treacherous allies. But he was in

straits during this year, and probably he could not

do otherwise than he did.

Dion Cassius (xl. 38) tells the story out of

Caesar of the affair of Noviodunum. He states in­

correctly what Caesar did on the occasion, and lie

shows that he neither understood his original, nor

knew what he was writing about.

3. A town of the Suessiones, mentioned by Caesar

(B. G. ii. 12). Caesar (b. c. 57), after leaving the

Axona (Aisne), entered the territory of the Sues­

siones, and making one day's long march, reached

Noviodunum, which was surrounded by a high wall

and a broad ditch. The place surrendered to Caesar.

It has been conjectured that Noviodunum Suessio-

num was the place afterwards called Augusta

[Augusta Suessionum], but it is by no means

certain. [G. L.]

NOVIODUNUM (Uoovtotowov). 1. A plat e in

Pannonia Superior, on the great road leading from

Aemona to Siscia, on the southern bank of the Savus.

(PtoL ii. 15. § 4; Itin. Ant. p. 259; Geogr. Kav.

iv. 19, where it is called Novindum.) Ita modern

name is Novigrad.

2. A town and fortress in Lower Moesia, a little

above the point where tbe Danube divides itself into

several arms. (PtoL iii. 10. § 11.) Near this town

the emperor Valeria constructed a bridge over the

Danube for his expedition against the Greuthungi.

(Amm. Marc, xxvii. 1.) Some writers have supposed,

without any g<>od reason, that Noviodunum is the

point at which Darius ordered a bridge to be built

when he set out on his expedition against the

Scythians. The town, as its name indicates, was of

Celtic origin. According to the Antonine Itinerary

(p. 226) Noviodunum was the station of the legio n.

Herculea, while according to the M Notitia Imperii"

it had the legio I. Jovia for its garrison. During

the later period of the Western Empire, the fortifica­

tions of the place had been destroyed, but they were

restored by Justinian (Procop. de Aed. iv. 11; com p.

Hierocl. p. 637; and Constant. Porph. de Them. ii. 1,

where the place is called Ua6t6Howos and Na&o-

Zowov). The Civitas Nova in Jomandes {Get. 5)

is probably the same as Noviodunum; and it is

generally believed that its site is occupied by the

modern Isaczi [L. S.]

NOVIOMAGUS (Noio>o>oy). 1. A town in

Gallia, which afterwards had the name Lexovii [Lex-

ovii], which was that of a people of Celtica. In

the Greek text of Ptolemy (ii. 8. § 2), as it is at

present printed, the word Li men {Kifiijv) is put

after the name Noeomagns. But this is not true,

for Noriomagus is Lisieux, which is not on the

sea, though the territory of the Lexovii extended to

the sea.

2. Afterwards Nemetes, in Gallia, the capital of

the Nemetae or Nemetes [Nemetes.] The name
