NEAPOLIS. 413 NEBKODES MONS.

the name of tlie city written among its branches.

(Eckhel. Tol. iii. pp. 433—435: see Geuizim, Vol. I.

p. 992. a.) [G. W.]

2. A town of Colchis, sonth of Dioscurias, and

north of Phasis, on the river Chobos or Chorsos.

(ScyL p. 27; Ptol. v. 10. § 2.)

3. A town on the coast of Ionia, south of Ephcsus,

on the road between Anaea and Marathesium. It

wis a small place which at first belonged to the

Ephe*ians, and afterwards to the Samians, who

received it in exchange for Marathesium. (Strab.

xiv. p. 639.) Most writers identify its sito with the

nmdern Scala Nora, at a distance of about three

hours' walk from the site of ancient Kphesus; bnt

Col. Leake (Asia Minor, p. 261) believes that this

place marks the site of the ancient Marathesium, and

that the ancient remains found about halfway

between Scala Nora and Tshangli, belong to the

ancient town of Neapolis. (Comp. Toumcfort, Let­

ters, xx. p. 402: Fellows, Journal of an Exc. in As.

J/in, p. 271, who identifies Neapolis with Tshangli

or Changli itself.)

4. A town in Caria, between Orthosis and Aphro-

disias, at the foot of Mount Cadmus, in the neigh­

bourhood of Hsrpasa. (Ptol. v. 2. § 19; Hicrocl.

p. 688.) Kichter (Wallfahrten, p. 539) identifies

it with the modern Jenibola, near Arpas KaUssi, the

ancient Harpasa. Another town of the same name

i.- mentioned on the coast of Caria by Mela (i. 16)

and Pliny (v. 29); and it is clear that this cannot be

the same town as that near Uarpas ; it is probably

only another name for New Myndus [Mtndcs].

5. A town in Pisidia, a few miles south of

Antioch. (Ptol. v. 4. § 11; Hierocl. p. 672.) Pliny

(v. 42) mentions it as a town of the Roman province

of Galatia, which embraced a portion of Pisidia.

Franz (Finf Inschrifttn, p. 35) identifies its site

with Tutinet, where some ancient remains still

exi»t. [L. S.]

6. A small place situated on the Euphrates,

at the distance of 14 scboeni (about 40 miles)

Ki"W Be*echana. Kitter has tried, but unsuccess­

fully (if the present numbers be correct) to identify

it »ith Maida. (Isid. Ham. 1'arth. i. 12, ed. Miiller,

1855.) [V.]

NEAPOLIS. III. In Africa. 1. In Egypt.

[Caesej-ous.]

2. A town of Oyrenaica, which Ptolemy (iv. 4. §

11) places in 31° ltf lat and 49° long. 'The town

of Mabny or Mubly, with which it has been identi­

fied, and which appears to be a corruption of the

eld name, with no other change than what might be

expected from the Arab pronunciation, does not

quite agree with the position assigned by Ptolemy

to Nmpoli*. (Beechey, Exped. to the N. Coast of

Africa, p. 350; Barth, Wandenmgen, pp. 391. 405.)

3. [Lcrm Magna.]

4. A town of Zcugitana with a harbour (Scylax,

p. 47; Shuiiasm. (j 107 ), the same as the Maco-

XADE8 of Pliny (v. 3; Moxo>aSa, Ptol. iv. 3. § 11);

a * manicipium,n as it appears from the Antonine

Itinerary (•' Macomades Minores," Pent. Tab.; Geog.

Kav. in. 5); this latter name indicates a Phoenician

cru'in. (Movers, Photnu. Alterth. vol. ii. p. 494.)

It has been identified wilh Kasir Ounga, on the

N. of the Gulf of Ilammamet.

5. A factory of the Carthaginians upon the Sinus

XKAPOUTAXL'a, from which it was the i>hoitest dis­

tance to Sicily — a voyage of two days and a night.

(Tboc- vii. 50; Scylax, p 49; Stadiami. § 107;

Strab. xvii. p. 834.) It was taken by Agathoclcs in

his African campaign. (Diodor. xx. 17.) Under the

earlier emperors it was a " liberum oppidum " (Plin.

v. 3 ), afterwards under Hadrian a " colonia." (Ptol.

iv. 3. § 8; /tin. Anton.; Peut. Tab.; Geog. Kav. v. 5.)

The old name is retained in the modern Nabel. where

Barth (Wanderungen, p. 141; comp. Shaw. Trav. p.

161) found some remains of antiquity. [E. B. J.]

NERIS. [Gallaecia, Vol. I. p. 933, a.]

NEBO. 1. (NaSao, LXX.), the mountain from

which the patriarch Moses was permitted to view

the Promised Land. Its situation is thus described:

— "Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto

Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that

is over against Jericho" (Veut. xxxii. 49); "and

Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the

mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over

against Jericho." We have here three names of the

mount, of which, however, Abarim may designate

the range or mountain region rising from the high

table-land of Moab (comp. Numbers, xxvii. 12,

xxxiii. 47); while Pisgah is an appellative for a hill,

—as it is rendered in our margin, wherever the

name occurs in the text (Numb. xxi. 20; Deul,

iii. 27, xxxiv. 1), and in several oriental versions

(Lex. s. p. H3DD),—Nebo the proper name of some

one particular peak. This name is regarded by M.

Quatremere as of Aramaic origin, identical with that

of the celebrated Chaldean divinity (Isaiah, xlvi. 1)

so frequently compounded with the names of their

most eminent kings, &c.; and he discovers other

names of like origin in the same parts. (Memoire

sur les Nabateens, p. 87.) It is placed by Eusebiua

and St. Jerome 6 miles west of Esbus (Heshbon),

over against Jericho, on the road from Livias to

Esbus, near to Mount Phogor [Peor]: it was

still called by its ancient name (Onomast. s. w.

Nabau. Abarim). Dr. Robinson has truly remarked

that over against Jericho " there is no peak or point

perceptibly higher than the rest; but all is appa­

rently one level line of summit, without peaks or

paps." ..." Seetzen, Burckhardt, and also Irby and

Mangles, have all found Mount Nebo in Jebel 'A tta-

rus, a high mountain south of the Zirka Main"

(Amon). This, however, is far south of the lati­

tude of Jericho. (Bib. lies. vol. iii. pp. 306, 307).

2. A town of the tribe of Reuben, mentioned

with Heshbon, Elealeh, and others (Numb, xxxii.

38); doubtless the site now marked by Neba in the

Belka, south of Es-Salt (Robinson, Bib. lies. vol.

ii. p. 307, n. 1, vol. iii. appendix, p. 170), \. e. in

the same district with Htsban and El-'Al, the

modem representatives of Heshbon and Elealeh.

Whether this town was connected with the synony­

mous mountain is very uncertain.

3. A town in Judah. (Ezra, ii. 29; Nehem. vii.

33.) [G. W.]

NEBRISSA. [Narrissa.]

NEBRODES MONS (to Nfvpti&v tan, Strab.:

Monti di Madonia), one of the most considerable

ranges of mountains in Sicily. The name was

evidently applied to a part of the range which com­

mences near Capo Pelorus, and extends along tho

northern side of the island, the whole way to the

neighbourhood of Panormus. Though broken into

various mountain groups, there is no real interrup­

tion in the chain throughout this extent, and the

names applied to different parts of it seem to have

been employed (as usual in such cases) wilh much

vagueness. The part of the chain nearest to Capo

IMonis, was called Mons Neptunius, and therefore

'the Mons Nebrodes must have been further to the
