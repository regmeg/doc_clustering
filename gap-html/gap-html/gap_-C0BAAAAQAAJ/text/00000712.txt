I'HYSCCS (4>yiTfcoj: Eih. <bv(TKtus), a town of

Carta, in the territory of the Khodians, situated on

tin? coast, with a harbour and a prove sacred to Leto.

(Strab. xiv. p. fi.VJ; Stmliit.<m. Mar. May. § *J45:

Ptol. v. 2. § 11, where it is called towraa.) It is im­

possible to suppose that thu Pbysctu was the |«>rt-

town of Mylasa (Strab. xiv. p. 659): we must rather

assume that Passala, the port of Mylasa, also bore

tbe name of Physcua, Our Physcua was the ordi­

nary landing-place for vessels sailing from Rhodes

to Asia Minor. (Strab. xiv. p 663: com p. Staph.

It. s. r.) This harbour, now called Marmorice, and

a part of it Pftyaco, is one of the finest in the world,

town in the interior of Acarnania, situated cn a height

road from Stratus to Medeon and Limnaea. After

the time of Alexander the Great it fell into tbe

hands of the Actoliuns, together with the other towns

in the W. of Acarnania. It was taken by Philip in

his expedition against Aetolia in n. C. 219; but the

Aetoliaus, doubtless, obtained posscssinn of it again,

eitlier before or after the conquest of Philip by the

Romans. It is mentioned as one of the towns of

Acarnania in a Greek inscription fmnd at J*unlti,

the site of Actiuni, tlie date of which is probably

prior to the time of Augustus. In this inscription

tli<- ethnic form <otridy occurs, which is analogous
