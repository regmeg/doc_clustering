no affinity either in langnnge or descent, they hare

an old version of the Bible into their language.

The structure of this language has been studied

by Adelung (Mithridat. vol. i. pp. 430, foil.) and

other modern philologers, among whom may be

mentioned Brosset, the author of several learned

memoirs on the Georgian grammar and language:

Klaproth, also, has given a lung vocabulary of it, in

ha Asia Polyylatta.

Armenian writers have supplied historical me­

moirs to Georgia, though it has not been entirely

wanting in domestic chronicles. These curious

records, which have much the style and appearance

of the half-legendary monkish histories of other

countries, are supposed to be founded on substantial

truth. One of the most important works on Georgian

history is the memorials of the celebrated Orpelian

family, which have been published by St. Martin,

with a translation. Some account of these, along

with a short sketch of the History of the Georgians

and their literature, will be found in Pilchard

(Physical Hut. of Mankind, vol. iv. pp. 261—276).

Dubois de Montpe'reux ( Vityaye autour du Caucate,

vol. ii. pp. 8—1G9) has given an outline of the

history of Georgia, from native sources; and the

maps in the magniBcent Atlas that accompanies his

work will be found of great service. [E. B. J.]

IBERIA IXDIAE ('ICipio, PeripL M. K. p. 24,

ed. Hudson), a district placed by the author of the

Periplus between Larica and the Scythians. It was

doubtless peopled by some of the Scythian tribes,

who gradually made their descent to the S. and SE.

part of Scmde, and founded the Indo-Scythic empire,

on the overthrow of the Greek kings of Bactria,

about n. c. 136. The name would seem to imply

that the population who occupied this district had

come from the Caucasus. [**•]

IBE'RL'S ('Iftic gen. -r/oos, and '\Snpot; in

MSS. often Hiberus: Kbro), one of the chief rivers

of Spain, the basin of which includes the NE. portion

of the peninsula, between the great mountain chains

of the Pyrenees and Idubeda, [HrsrAXiA.] It

rises in the mountains of the Cantabri, not far

from the middle of the chain, near the city of

Juliobriga (the source lies 12 miles W. of Beynota),

and, flowing with a nearly uniform direction to the

SE., after a course of 450 M. P. (340 miles), falls

into the Mediterranean, in 40° 42' N. 1st., and

U° 50' E. I«ng., forming a considerable delta at its

mouth. It was navigable for 260 M. P. from the

town of Vaiiia (Varea, in Buryat). Its chief

tributaries were:—on the left, the Sicorm (Segre)

and the Gallic is (Gallego), and on the right the

Salo (.Won). It was long the boundary of the

two Spains [IIispakia], whence prrhaps arose the

error of Appian (Hup. 6), who makes it divide the

peninsula into two equal parts. There are some

other errors not worthy of notice. The origin of the

name is disputed. Dismissing derivations from the

Phoenician, the question seems to depend very much

on whether the Iberians derived their name from the

river, as was the belief of the ancient writers, or

whether the river took its name from the people, as

W. von Humboldt contends. If the former was the

-M*, and if Nicbobx'a view ia correct, that the popu-

lation of NE. Spain was originally Celtic [Hts-

pahia], a natural etymology is at once found in the

Celtic aber, i. e. tcal'er. (Polyb. ii. 13, ili. 34, 40,

I I'.I.IODURUM, in Gallia Belgica, is placed by the

Antonine Itin. on the road between Virodunum ( ler-

dun) and Divodurum (iletz). The termination

(durum") implies that it is on a stream. The wholo

distance in the Itin. between Verdun and Melt ia

23 Gallic leagues, or 34} M. P., which is less than

even the direct distance between Verdun and Mttz.

There is, therefore, an error in the numbers in the

Itin. somewhere between Virodunum and Divodurum,

which D'Anville corrects in his usual way. The

site of Ibliodurum is supposed to be on the Iron, at

a place about two leagues above its junction with

the One, a branch of the Motel, and on the line of

an old road. [G. L.]

ICARUS, 1'CARIA (*I«ropot. 'litapia: NUaria),

an island of the Aegean, to the west of Samos, ac­

cording to Strabo (x. p. 480, xiv. 639), 80 stadia

from Cape Ampelos, while Pliny (v. 23) makes the

distance 35 miles. The island is in reulity a con­

tinuation of the range of hills traversing Samos from

east to west, whence it is long and narrow, and ex­

tends from NE. to SW. Its length, according to

Pliny, is 17 miles, and its circumference, according

to Strabo, 300 stadia. The island, which gave its

name to the whole of the surrounding sea (Icarium

Mare or Pelagut), derived its own name, according

to tradition, from Icarus, the son of Daedalus, who

was believed to have fallen into the sea near thia

island. (Ov. Mel. viii. 195, foil.) The cape form­

ing tho easternmost point of the island was called

I>repanum or iJracnmun (Strab. xiv. pp. 637. 639;

Horn. Hymn, xxxiv. 1; Diod. Sic. iii. 66; Plin. iv.

23; Steph. B. t. r. Apaxovoy), and near it was a

small town of tho some name. Further west, an

the north coast, was the small town of Ian

(*lo~Toi), with a tolerably good roadstead; to the

south of this was another little place, called Oknok

(OUAti, Strab. /. c; At lien. i. p. 30.) According to

some traditions, Dionysus was born on Cape Dra-

conum (Throcrit, Idyll, xxvi. 33), and Artemis bad

a temple near Isti, called Tauropuliun. The island

had received its first colonist* from Milrtua (Strab.

xiv. p. 635); but in the time of Strabo it brlonced

to the Samians: it had then but few iuhubiUiiU,

and was uininly nseil by the Samians as pasture land

for their flock*. (Strab. x. pp. 488, xiv. p. 639; Sry-

lax, pp. 22; Aeschyl./'cn. 887; Thucyd. iii. 92, vi'ii.
