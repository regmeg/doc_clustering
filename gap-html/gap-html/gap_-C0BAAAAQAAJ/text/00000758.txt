674 PRUSA. PROVINCIA.

the Narbonitis," says Strabo, "has the same nature]

products as Italia: but as we advance towards the

north and the Cemmenon (Ct mint's), the land

planted with the olive and the fig terminates, but all

the other things are grown. The grape also does not

ripen well as we advance further north" (iv. p. 178).

Strabo's remark about the olive is true. As we

advance from Xirnes by the great road to Clermont ,

Ferrawl in the Aiirrrff/w, we ascend gradually in a

north-west direction to a rocky country well planted

with vines, mulberry trees, and olives. After pro­

ceeding a few miles further the olives suddenly

disappear, a sign that we have passed the limits of

the temperature which they require. Tiie country

is now an irregular plateau, rocky and sterile, but in

parts well planted with mulberries and vines; and

there is a little wheat. Before descending to An-

dusia (Anduse), which is deep sunk in a gorge of

the Vardo (Gtird<m), a few more olives arc seen, but

these are the hist. We are approaching the rugged

Ceventux,

The native population of the Provincia were

Aquitani, Celtae, and Lignres. The Auuitani

were in the parts along the base of the Pyrenees.

The Ligures in the historical period occupied the

south-east part of the Provincia, north and cast of

Jfarsi illt, and it is probable that they were once on

the west side of the Rhone also. The Greeks were

on the coa>,t, cast and west of the city of Ma^-silia

[Massilia]. After the country was reduced to

the form of a Provincia, the Italians flocked to the

Provincia to make money. They were petty dealers

(mercatores), bankers, and money-lenders (negoti-

ntorcs), sheep-feeders, agriculturists, and traders.

(Cic. pro P. Quintio, c. 'A, pro M. Fonteio, c.

5.) The wine of Italy was imported into the Pro­

vincia in,Cicero's time, and a duty was levied on

it, if nut at the port, at least in its transit through

the country (pre Fontttv, c. 9). Cicero sneeringly

says, " We Romans are the most just of men, for we

do not allow the Transalpine nations to plant the

olive and the vine, in order that our olive plantations

and vineyards may be worth more" (f/<? Re PubU'-ti,

iii. 9). It does not appear from Ckero when this

selfish order was made. Hut the vine is a native of

Narbonen-is, and the Greeks made wine, as we might

safely assume, and they sold it to the Galli. Posi-

donius, whom Cicero knew, and who had travelled in

the country, says that the rich Galli bought Italian

wine and wine from the Mas-abuts. (Posidonius,

up. Athen. iv. p. 152.) If any of the Galli got

this wine, the Galli of the Provincia would have it.

This favourite province of the Romans was full of

large cities, which under the Empire were orna­

mented with works both splendid and useful, am­

phitheatres, temples, theatres, and aqueducts. Many

of these buildings have pe rial led, but the magnificent

monuments at Arh s anil Ntmcs, and the less striking

remains in other cities, show what this country was

under Roman dominion.

The tribes or peoples within the limits of the

Provincia are very numerous. Pliny lias a long list.

On the west side of the Rhone at the foot of the

Pyrenees were the Consorani and Sordoues or Sordi.

North of them were the Voleae Tectosages, whose

capital was Tolosa; and the Ruteni Provinciales.

The Voleae Arecomici occupied the country east of

the Tectosages and extended to tin* Rhone. The

po.-iti'in of the Tasconi, a small people mentioned by

Pliny, is only a matter of conjecture [Tasconi].

North of the Arecomici only one people is men­

tioned between the CtPmnes and thf Rhnr.?. 'i>
