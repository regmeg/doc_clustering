1324 VOLUSTAXA VOLSINII.

at the southern extremity of the lake; whilst Miiller

(Etrusher, i. p. 451) seeks it at Orv'teto, and ad­

duces tlie name of that place=Urbs Vetus, "the

old city," as an argument in favour of his view;

but Mr. Dennis (Etrurid, vol. i. p. 508) is of

opinion that there is no reason to believe that it was

bo far from the Roman town, and that it lay on the

summit of the hill, above the amphitheatre at Bol-

gena, at a spot called 11 Piazzano. He adduces in

support of this hypothesis the existence of a pood

deal of broken pottery there, and of a tew caves in

the cliffs below.

Volsinii appears to have been one of the most

powerful cities of Etruria, and was doubtless one of

the 12 which formed the Etruscan confederation, as

Volsinii is designated by Livy (x. 37) and Valerius

Maxim us (ix. 1. extern. 2) as one of the '* capita

Etruriae." It is described by Juvenal (iii. 191) as

seated among well-wooded hills.

We do not hear of Volsinii in history till after the

fall of Veil. It is possible that the success of the

Koman arms may have excited the alarm and jea­

lousy of the Volsinienses, as their situation might

render them the next victims of Roman ambition.

At all events, the Volsinienses, in conjunction with

the Sal pi nates, taking advantage of a famine and

pestilence which had desolated Rome, made incur­

sions into the Roman territory in B.C. 391. But

they were easily beaten: 8000 of them were made

prisoners; and they were clad to purchase a twenty

yours' truce on condition of restoring the booty

they had taken, and furnishing the pay of the Roman

army for a twelvemonth. (Liv. v. 31, 3*2.)

We do not again hear of Volsinii till the year

n. c. 310, when, in common with the rest of the

Etruscan cities, except Arretium, they took part in

the siege of Sutrium, a city in alliance with Rome.

(Liv. ix. 32.) This war was terminated by the de­

feat of the Etruscans at lake Vadimo, the first fatal

shock to their power. (/&. 39.) Three years after­

wards we find the consul P. Deems Mus capturing

several of the Volsinian fortresses. {Ib. 41.) In

295, L. Postumius Megellus ravaged their territory

and defeated them under the walls of their own city,

slaying 2800 of them; in consequence of which they,

together with Perusia and Arretium, were glad to

purchase a forty years' peace by the payment of a

heavy fine. (Id. x. 37.) Not more than fourteen

years, however, had elapsed, when, with their allies

the Vulcientes, they again took up arms against

R«>me. But this attempt ended apparently in their

final subjugation in B.C. 280. (Liv.Fp. xi.; Fast.

Com.) Pliny (xxxiv. 7. s. 1G) retails an absurd

story, taken from a Greek writer called Metrodorus

Scepsius, that the object of the Romans in capturing

Volsinii was to make themselves masters of 2000

statues which it contained. The story, however,

suffices to show that the Volshrians had attained to

a great pitch of wealth, luxury, and art. This is

confirmed by Valerius Maxim us (/. c\), who also

adds that this luxury was the cause of their ruin,

by making them so indolent and effeminate that

they at length suffered the management of their

commonwealth to be usurped by slaves. From this

degrading tyranny they were rescued by the Ro­

mans. (Flor. i. 21 ; Zonaras, /. c; A.Victor, Kir.

llhstr. 36 ; Oros. iv. 5.)

The Romans, when they took Volsinii, razed the

town, and compelled the inhabitants, as we have

already intimated, to migrate to another spot. (Zo-'

tiaras, c.) This second, or Roman, Volsinii con­

tinued to exist under the Empire. It was ti# t£**j>

place of Sejanus, the minister and U*r*u~.:e •<

Tiberias. (Tac. Ann. iv. 1, ?i. 8.) Ju^oi1 l.

From what has been already said it may he c-

some remains are still extant at Boi*n*%, TV
