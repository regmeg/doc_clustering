in which were situated the temples of Ceres and

Proserpine, both of whirl) lie gave up to plunder,

lint the anger of the goddesses, brought on by this

act of sacrilege, was believed to lit.* the source of all

the calamities that soon befel him. A pestilence

broke out in the Carthaginian camp, from which

they sustained very heavy losses, and Dionysius took

advantage of their enfeebled state to make a general

attack on their camp both by sea and land. The

position occupied by the Carthaginians was very

much the same as that which had been held by the

Athenians: they occupied the headland of Plemmy-

riuui, nn which they had erected a fort, while they

had also fortified the Olympieum, or Polichne, and

constructed a third fort close to the edge of the

Great Harbour for the protection of their fleet, which

lay within the inner bay or harbour of Dascon. But

I)iony>ius, by a sudden attack from the land side,

carried both the last forts, and at the same time suc­

ceeded in burning a great part of the Carthaginian

fleet, so that Hiinilco was compelled to abandon the

enterprise, and by a secret capitulation secured a

safe retreat for himself and the native Carthaginians

in his army, abandoning his allies and mercenaries

to their fate. (Diod. xiv. 62, 63, 70—75.)

The defeat of the Carthaginian armament left

Dionysius undisputed master of Syracuse, while that

city held as unquestioned a pre-eminence over the

other cities of Sicily; and it is probable that the city

it>elf continued to increase in extent and population.

The impregnable citadel in the island of Ortygia

constructed by the elder Dionysius continued to be

the bulwark of his power, as well as that of his son

and successor. Even when the citizens, in B. c. 357,

opened their gates to Dion, who made a triumphal

entry into Achradina, and made himself master with

little dith'culty of the fort on the summit of Epipolae,

the islanil still held out, and Dion was compelled to

n\v,rt to a bhttjkadc, having erected a line or wall of

contravallation across from the lesser port to the

greater, so as effectually to cut off the garrison from

ail communication with the interior. (Plat Dion,

2!>; Diod. xvi 12.) It was not till after the block­

ade had been continued for above a year that Apollo-

crates was compelled by scarcity of provisions to

surrender this stronghold, and Dion thus became

complete master of Syracuse, n. c. 356. But that

event ilid not, as had been expected, restore liberty

to Syracuse, and tlie island citadel still remained

the stronghold of 1 tie despots who successively ruled

over the city. When at length Tiuioleon lauded in

Sicily (b.c. 344) Ortygia was once more in the

possession of Dionysius, while the rest of the city

was in the hands of Hicetas, who was supported by

a Carthaginian ileet and army, with which he closely

blockaded the island fortress. But the arrival of

Tiinoleon quickly changed the face of affairs: Or­

tygia was voluntarily surrendered to him by Dio­

nysius; and Neon, whom he left there as commander

of the parrison, by a sudden sally made himself

master of Achradina also. Soon alter Tiuioleon car­

ried the heights of Epipolae by assault, and thus

found himself master of the whole oi Syracuse. One

of the first measures he took after his success was to

demolish the fortress erected by Dionysius within

the Island, as well as the palace of the despot

himself, and the splendid monument that had been

creeled to him by his son and successor. On the

site were erected the new courts of justice. (Plut

Timol. 22.)
