from Jovian. (Amm. Marc. xxv. 7. § 9, comp.

xxiii. 3. § 5; Lc Bean, Bos Empire, vol. i. p. 380,

vol. iii. p. 161 ; Gibbon, cc. xiii. xxiv.). Its exact

position cannot be made out, though it mtbt have

been near Kurdistan. (Kitter, Ertlbumit, vol. x.

p. 816.) [K. B.J.]

MUCHIRE'SIS (Movxtlmatf al. MouxiifMtrii,

Procop. B. G. iv. 2,15, 16), a Clinton of Lazicu, po­

pulous and fertile: the vine, which does not grow

in the rest of Colchis, was found here. It was

watered by the river Kheon ('PeW). Archaeopolis,

its chief town, was the capital of Colchis, and a

place of considerable importance in the Lazic war.

c. xlii.) [K. B. J.]

MUCKAE or NUCRAE (the reading is uncertain),

a town of Samuium, mentioned only by Silius Italicus

(viii. 566), the situation of which is whollv un­

known. [E. H. B.]

MUCUXI. [Maibktaisia.]

MUDUTTI. [Modutti.]

ML'GILI.A, an ancient city of Latium, mentioned

only by Dionysius (viii. 36), who enumerates the

Mugillani (MoyiKaivovs) among the places conquered

by Coriolanus, at the head of the Vol.scian army.

He tlicre mentions them (as well as the Albietes. who

are equally unknown) between the citizens of Polluscu

anil C'oriuli, and it is therefore probable that Mu-

gilla lay in the neighbourhood of those cities; but we

have no further clue to its site. The name does not

again appear, even in Pliny's list of the extinct cities

of Latium; and we should be apt to suspect some

mistake, but that the cognomen of Mugillanus,

borne by one family of the Papirian Gens, seems to

confirm the correctness of the name. [E. H. B.]

MUICU'RUM (MouJXoDpoi'), a place on the coast

of Illyricum, near Saluna, which was taken for Tolila,

kin£ of the Goths, by Ilauf. (l'rocop. B. G. iii. 35;

Le Bean. Bits Empire, vol. ix. p. 82.) [E. B. J.]

MULEI.ACHA, a town upon a promontory of

the same name on the W. coast of Africa (Polyb.

ap. Plin. v. 1), now Mul-y Bu Stlhtim, the old

Mamura of the charts. (Oomp. London Geog. Juurn.

vol. vi. p. 302.) [E. B. J.]

MUIXCHA, a river of Mauritania, which Sal lust

{Jug. <J2,110), Mela (i. 5. §§ 1,5), and Pliny (v. 2)

assign as the boundary between the Mauri and Mas-

laesyli, or the subjects of Bocchus and Jugurtha.

As Stmbo (xvii. pp. 827,829) makes the Miiui-

oath (MoAox<f0, MoAox<W, Ptol. iv. 1. §7) serve

the same purpo>e, there can be no doubt that they

are one anil the same river. The M.vr.VA (MoAoi/a,

Ptol. I. c.) of l'liny (/. c), or the Mulmri, which

forms the frontier between Morocco and Algeria, is

the same as the river which bounded the Moors from

the Numidians. This river, rising at or near the

S. extremity of the lower chain of Atlas, and flow­

ing through a diversified country, as yet almost

untrodilcn by Europeans, falls into the sea nearly in

the middle of the Gulf of ildilah of our charts.

(Shaw, Trav. pp. 10—16.) [E. B. J.]

MUNDA (Mouvta). 1. An important town of

Ilispania Baetica, and a Roman colony belonging to

the conventus of A-itigi. (Strab. iii. p. 141; Plin.

iii. 1. ».;).) Strabo (I.e.) says that it is 1400

stadia from Carteia. It was celebrated on account

of two battles fought in its vicinity, the first in

B.C. 216. when Cn. Scipio defeated the Cartha­

ginians (I.iv. xxiv. 42; Ml. Ital. iii. 4011), and the

second in B. c. 45, when Julius Caesar gained a

victory over the sons of Pompey. (Diou Cass.

xliii. 39; Auct. Belt. Hisp. 30, seq.; Strab. iii.

pp. 141, 160; Klor. iv. 2; VaL Max. vii. 6.) It

was taken by one of Caesar's generals, and, acuordinc

to Pliny, from that time it ceased to exist. (" Fnit

Munda cum Pompei filio rapta," Plin. iii. I. a. 3 )

But this cannot be correct, as Strabo (L c.) describes

it as an important place in his time. It is nsttaJIv

identified with the village of Monda, SW. of Malara;

but it has been pointed out that in the vicinity of ti»

modem Monda, there is no plain adapted fur a 6eU

of battle, and that the ancient city should probably

be placed near Cordota. It has been supposed that

the site of Munda is indicated by the remains of

ancient walls and towers lying between Marios,

Alcaudete, Esprjo, and liana. At all events this

site agrees better with the statement of Strabo, that

Munda is 1400 stadia from Carteia, for the distance

from the modern Monda to the latter place is only

400 stadia; and it is also more in accordance with

Pliny, who places Munda between Attubi and Ursa.

2. A town of the Celtiberi in Hispania Tarrm-

conensis, prolably near the frontiers of the Carpe-

tani. (Liv. xl. 47.)

3. A river on the \V. coast of Lusitania, falling

into the sea between the Tagus and Darius, now

the MonaVgo. (Plin. iv. 21. s. 35 ; MourJai, Strab.

iii. p. 153; Mfjv&at, Ptol. ii. 5. § 4; Maxc. p. 41)

MUNDOBRIGA. [Mkdobrioa.]

MUXIMENTUM COKBULOXIS. [Corbcuv

HIS MlNIMKNTVM ]

MUXIMENTUM TRAJAKI, a fort in the coun­

try of the Mattiaci. (Amm. Marc. xvii. I.) Its

site is not certain, though it is generally betiewd

that the Roman remains near I/Ocfcst are lb* mists

of this fort. (VVilhelm, 6'ermani™, p. 148.) [L.&]

MUNY'CHIA. [Athesae, p. 306.]

MUKA'NUM (J/orano), a town of the interior <t

Lucania, the name of which is not found in any

ancient author; but its existence is proved by the

Itinerary of Antoninus, which places a station Sum-

murano, evidently a corruption of Sub Muraoo. oa

the road from Nernlum to Consentia; and this is

confirmed by the inscription found at La /Wis

[Fuim-m PfiPii.il], which gives the distance from

that place to Muranum at 74 M. P. It is. thsjtv-

fore, evident that Muranum must have occupied the

same site as the modem town of Moron", on a oc-

siderable hill, at the foot of which still rum th*

high road from Naples to Jtrggio, and wber* w:aa

situated the station noticed in llie Itinerary. Near

it are the sources of the river 0*scile. the ancient

Sybaris. (/tin. Ant. pp. 105, 110; OnrlL Imter.

MUliUOGI (Moupgoyoi, Ptol. ii. 6. § 52). a

people in Hispania Tarraconensis, the southern

neighbours of the Cantabri, are the same as th»

people called TritMomo! by Pliny (iii. 3. s. 4) and

Orosius (vi. 21). This may be inferred from U«

fact that Pliny calls Segisamo a town of the Tur-

inodigi, and Ptolemy callt Deubrigula a town at

the Murbogi; while in the Antonine Itinerary (ax

449) these two towns aro oedy 15 mika apart.
