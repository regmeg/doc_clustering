754 ROMA. ROMA,

(Lit. x\v. 39), thus establishing the identity of the

gate to at least tli.it period.

But to return to Becker's explanation of the

passage of Joscphus. Admitting Plutarch's account

lit'the triumphs nf Paullus and Lucullus, namely,

tliat they passed through the Circus Flaminios, yet

what does this prove? how is it connected with the

Porta Triumphalis? Those generals may have

marshalled their processions in the Campus and

passed through the Circus Flaminins in their way

to the Porta Triumphalis. The precession would

have Wen equally visible in the Circus as in the

streets of Home, just as the Lord Mayor's show may,

or might, be seen at Westminster as well as in the

citv. It is pissible indeed that in the case of Ves­

pasian there was no procession till he arrived at the

gate; but it does nut necessarily follow that the

same line was always precisely observed. In truth

we may perceive a difference between the expressions

of Josepluw and those of Plutarch. The former

savs that Vespasian went Sia twc Hfdrpuy; whilst

Plutarch says, of Paullus, that the people assembled

iv rois twitika is dfaTO'H*, 6\ KtpKovs Kahovatv;

of Lucullus, that he adorned tof 'PXafiiffiov i'tttto-

Sftofiov. lien* the cirri are precisely designated as

hipp'xlromes; but Josephus uses the general term

^aTpiur. which may include theatres of all kinds.

Xow we will suggest a mure probable route than

that given by Becker, according to which the pa­

geant must have crossed the forum twice. After

coming out at the further end nf the circus, Ves­

pasian turned down to the left, between the Palatine

and Caelian, the modern Via dt S. Grtgorio. This

wonld bring him out opposite his own magnificent

amphitheatre, the Colosseum, then in course of con-

struclion. Even if it had not risen much above its

foundations, still its ample area by means of scaffold­

ings, would have accommodated a vast number nf

spectators; and as to Vespasian personally, it would

have imparled no small rciish to his triumph to

pa-s thruugh so magnificent a work of his own

creation. Hence his road lay plain and direct over

thf Sumina Sacra Via to the f>rum and Capitol.

Xow, taking all thesp things into consideration,

we will venture to suggest a very slight change in

1 lie te\t ot Josephus, a change not so great as some

of those often proposed by Becker upon much

smaller occasions, and which will release us from a

great deal of perplexity. The alteration is that of

an N into a n. a very slight one in the uncial cha­

racter; and, by reading drex^pei for ew€Xwp*t, we

would make Vespasian depart from the Porticos

Octaviae towards the gate which had always been

u-ed fa- triumphs, instead of retracing It is steps

towards one of which nobrx.lv can give any account.

But whatever may be thought of the individual

case of Ve-pasian, still we hold it to be incontestable

that tin- ancient Porta Triumphalis, against which

the sole objection seems to be that it was near two

other gates, i-, t>> be sought in that part of the

Servian wall between the P. Carmentalis and the

1*. Flumentana. The objection just alluded to would

indeed have some force, if we could assume, with

Becker (Handb. p. 154), that the Porta Triumphalis,

just like an ordinary one, lav always open for com­

mon traffic. But it is surprising how anvbodv could

come to that conclusion utter reading the passages

which Becker has himself cited from Suetonius,

Tacitus, and Dion Cassius, or that in Cicero's ora­

tion against Piso before quoted. The first of these

authors relates that after the death of Augustus

the senate voted, or pmpneed to vtfe, that.a» o

extraordinary mark of honour, his ftiflTil
