1274 VENETIA. VENETIA.

59. The period at which the Veneti acquired the

Roman franchise is uncertain: we are only left to

infer that they obtained it at the same time as the

Transpadane Gauls, in n. c. 49. (Dion Cass,

xli. 56.)

Under tbe Roman Empire, Venetia (as already

mentioned) was included, together with Istria, in

the Tenth Region of Augustus. The land of the

Carni (Carnorum regio, Plin. iii. 18. s. 22) was at

this time considered, fur administrative purposes, as

a part of Venetia; though it is .still described as dis­

tinct by Ptolemy (iii. 1. 25, 20): ami there is no

doubt that the two nations were originally separate.

Hut as the population of both districts became

thoroughly Romanised, all traces of this distinction

were lost, and the names of Venetia and Istria alone

remained in use. These two continued to form one

province, aud we meet with mention, both in inscrip­

tions and in the Nolitia, of a "Corrector Venetiae et

Ilistriae," down to the close of the Roman Empire,

(Xotit. Dign. n. p. 05; Bix-king, ad be. p. 441;

Orel!. Inscr. 1050, 3191.) The capital of the united

provinces was Aquileia, which r<>se under the Roman

Empire to be one of the most flourishing cities of

Italy. Its importance was derived, not from its wealth

and commercial prosperity only, but from its situ­

ation at the very entrance of Italy, on the highroad

which became the great means of communication

between the Eastern and Western Empires. The

same circumstance led to this part of Venetia be­

coming the scene of repeated contests for power

between rival emperors. Thus it was before Aquileia

that the Emperor Maxim in perished in A.n. 2.3$; it

was on the banks of the river Alsa (Ai\«t) that the

voum:cr Constantino was defeated and slain, in a.d.

340; again, in 388, the contest between Maximus

and Theodosius the Great was decided in the same

neighbourhood; and iu 425, that between the

usurper Joannes and the generals of Tlieodosius II.

[Aquileia.] Finally, in a. d. 489, it was on the

rivi-r Sontius (Isonzo) that Odoacer was defeated by

the Gothic king Theodoric. (Hist. Misctll. xvi. p.

501.)

It seems certain that Venetia had become under

the Roman Empire a very opulent and flourishing

province: besides Aquileia, Patavium and Verona

were provincial cities of the first class; and many

other towns such as Concordia, Altinum, Forum

Julti, &c, whose names are little known in history,

were nevertheless opulent and considerable municipal

towns. Rut it suffered with peculiar severity from

the inroads of the barbarians before the close of the

Empire. The passage across the Julian Alps from

the valley of the Save to the plains of Aquileia, which

presents few natural difficulties, became the high­

way by which all the barbarian nations in succession

descended into the plains of Italy: and hence it was

Venetia that, felt the first brunt of their fury. This

was especially the case with the invasion of Attila in

A. d. 452, who, having at length reduced Aquileia

after a long siege, razed it to the ground; and then,

advancing with fearful rapidity, devastated iu like

manner the cities of Concordia, Altinum, Fatavium,

Vicentia, Verona, Brixia, and Bergomum, not one

of which was able to oppose any effectual resistance.

{Hist. MiscelL xv. p, 549.) The expression of the

chronicler that he levelled these cities with the

ground is probably exaggerated; but there can be no

doubt that they suffered a blow from which three of

them at least, Concordia, Altinum, aud Aquileia,

never recovered. In the midst of this devastation
