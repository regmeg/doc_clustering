who refers the story of the Porta Pan<iaua to the

treaty with the Gaul-, by which the Etonians en-

gaped always to have one pate open, but, in order

to evade the consequences, built it in an inaccessible

phu-e.

After ]>eare had been concluded between Romulus

and Tatius, they possessed two distinct but united

cities,—the former reigning on the Palatine, the

latter on the Capitoline, and. dwelling on the spot

whi-re thf temple of Juno Muueta afterwards stood

(Pint. Horn. 2: Sol. i. 21.) When Tacitus says,

in the passage before cited, that latins added the

Capil iline to the city, we are perhaps therefore to

understand that he built u»<on it and made it habit­

able, whilst previously it had been only a port of

military outpost. The valley between the two hills

formed a kind of neutral ground, and served as a

c'inmon market-place. The pate called Janualis,

mentioned by Varro in the passage cited from him

when treating of the Ilomub-an irate.-., seems undoubt­

edly to have belonged tothe Sabine town. Kiebubr,

who is followed by Bunsen (Btschr. vol. i. p. 14."»).

is of opinion (Hist, i. that it was built by the

two cities as a barrier of their common liberties;

that it was open in time of war in order that suc­

cour inipht priss from one to the other, and shut

during peace, cither to prevent the quarrels which

might arise from unrestricted intercourse, or as a

token that the cities, though united, were distinct.

Becker, on the other hand, denies that it ever was a

pat.- nt nil, maintaining that it only pot that name

caUirhrettumlly, from the temple which it subse­

quently formed being called " Porta Belli" (pp. 118,

1 19, and note lu7). Ii it there seems to be ample

e\ idence that it was originally a cate. Varro, in the

passage cited, evidently considered it as such; and

it is also mentioned by Macrnbius as a real gate,

though the situation which he assigns to it will

hardly be allowed even by those who give the great­

est extent ion to the w alls of the I tornu lean city

We see from these lines, that the pit*
