■124 NICER.

NICAEA.

to tlie E. of that river, wis naturally included in

Italy, and is accordingly so described by Strabo

riiny. and Ptolemy. (Strab. iv. p. 184; Plin. iii.

5. s. 7; Pt»l. iii. 1. § 2.) We have no account of

its early history, beyond the fact that it was a

colony of Massilia, and appears to have continued

always in a state of dependency upon that city.

(Strab. iv. pp. 180, 184; Plin. J. c; Steph. B.s.p.)

It was situated on the borders of the Ligurian tribes

of tho Oxybii and Deciates: and, as well as its

neighbour Antipniis, was continually harassed by

the incursions of these barbarians. In B. c. 154

both cities wore actually besieged by the Ligurians;

and the Massilians, finding themselves unable to re­

pulse the assailants, applied to Rome for assistance;

the consul Q. Opiinius. who was despatched with

nn anny to their succonr, quickly compelled the

I.iguriuns to lay down their arms, and deprived them

of a considerable part of their territory, which was

annexed to the dependency of Mass ilia- (Pol. xxxiii.

4, 7; Liv. Kpil. xlvii.) From this time, nothing

more is heard in history of Nicaea, which continued

to Mnng to the jurisdiction of Massilia, and, even

after it came to be subject to the Romans, and

included geographically in Italy, was still for munici­

pal purposes dependent upon its parent city. (Strab.

iv. ]i. 184.) At a later period, the new division of

the provinces again transferred to Gaul the towns of

Nicaea and Cemenclium, together with the whole

district of the Maritime Alps, westward of the

Tropnea Augusti. Hence, we find Nicaea described

by Ammianus (xv. 11. § 15) as belonging to Gaul;

and during the decline of the Empire, after it had

lieconie an episcopal see, the names of its bishops are

found among the Gaulish prelates. It does not ap­

pear to have ever been a town of much importance

under the Roman Empire; and was apparently

eclipsed by the city of Ccmenelium (Cimicz), in

its immediate neighbourhood. Rut it had a good

p»rt, which must always have secured it some share

of prosperity, and after the fall of Cemenelium, it

rose to be the most important city in this part of Gaul,

and became the capital of an independent district

called the Contailo di Xaza (County of Nice). This

eventually fell into the hands of the House of Savoy,

and mtw forms part of the dominions of the king of

Sardinia. Nice itself is a flourishing place, with

about 30,000 inhabitants, but has no remains of

antiquity. The ancient city probably occupied the

height, now the site of the castle, and the immediate

neighbourhood of the port, which though small,

is secure. Nice is situated at tho mouth of the

river Faglione, a con-siderable mountain torrent,

evidently the stream called Paulo by Pliny and

Mela. (Plin. I c; McL ii. 4. §9.)

About 2 miles E. of A'l'ce is a deep bay or inlet

between two rocky promontories, forming a spacious

natural, harbour now known as the Gulf of Villa*

franca, from a town of that name, which has

however existed only since the 13th century. This

is probably the Porti'S Ouvula of the Maritime

Itinerary (p. 504). The Amao Porti» of the

same Itinerary is probably a small cove, forming a

well-sheltered harbour for small vessels on the E.

side of the headland, called Capo di S. Oipizio,

which forms the eastern boundary of tho Gulf of

VilLifranca. A similar cove a few miles further E.

just below the modern village of Fza, is probably

the Avihio Portl's of the same authority; but the

distances given between these points are greatly

overstated. [E. H. B.J

Locri Epicncmidii, situated upon the sea, and cla*

to the pass of Thermopylae. It is described by

Aeschines as one of the places which commanded

the pass. (De Fall. Leg. p. 45, ed. Steph.) It «a»

the first Locrian town after Alpenos, tha latter beiat

at the very entrance of the pass. The surrender rf

Nicaea by Phalaecus to Philip, in B. c. 346. made

tho Macedonian king master of Thermopylae, and

brought the Sacred War to an end. (Diod. rri.

59.) Philip kept possession of it for some tiro*. Ut

subsequently gave it to the Theasaliana along wi:k

Magnesia. (Dem. Phil. ii. p. 153. ed. Reiske: Aesrh.

c. Ctetiph. p. 73, ed. Steph.) But in n. c. 340 we

again find Nicaea in tl» possession of Philip.

(Dem. in Phil. Kp. p. 153.) According to Homes

(ap. Phot. p. 234, a., ed. Bekker ; c. 41; e«L Orviii)

Nicaea was destroyed by the Phocians, and ita in­

habitants founded the Bithynian Nicaea. Bet e»«

if this is true, the town must have been rebuilt soon

afterwards, since we find it in the hands of the Ae-

tolians during the Roman wars in Greece. (Pohii.

x. 42, xvii. 1 ; Liv. xxviii. 5, xxxii. 32.) Subse­

quently the town is only mentioned by Strabo (ix.

p. 426). Leake identifies Nicaea with the castle ef

Pundonitza, where there are Hellenic remains.

Euphrates. According to Isidoms (.Warns. I'nrtk.

i. ed. Muller) and Pliny (v. 24. s. 21. vi. 26. a. 301

it owed its foundation to Alexander the Great; ac­

cording, however, to Apptan, to Seleucua I., which

is much more likely (Syrinc. c. 57). It is men­

tioned by Dion Cassius (xl. 13) and by Taritas

(Ann. vi. 40), but simply as one of many towns

founded by the Macedonians. Strabo eaUs il a

town of the Mygdonians in Mesopotamia (xvi. p.

747). Nothing is known of its intermediate hi'tory;

but Justinian erected a fortress here (Prorop. d*

Aedif. ii. 7); and the emperor Leo, who probably

added several new works to it, is and to bars

changed its name to I*euntopoli*. (C'f. Hienrl.
