invaded and counnered their country. Marobodutis

fled, and demanded the protection of Tiberius, who

offered to him a safe retreat in Italy. He there

sjient the remaining eighteen years of his life, while

the throne of the Marcoinanni was left to Catualda,

[Diet, ofliiorjr. art. Maroboihcs.] But the latter,

too, was soon exj>elled by the Hcrmunduri, and ended

his life in exile. (Tac. Ann. ii. 62, 63.) The Mar-

comanni, however, like the Quadi, continued to be

governed by kincs of their own, though they were

not quite independent of the Romans, who often sup-

j>orte«l them with money and more rarely with troops.

(Tac. Germ. 42.) They appear to have gradually

extended their dominion to the hanks of the Danube,

where they came into hostile collision with the

Romans. The emperor Domitian demanded their

assi stance against the Dacians, and this being re­

fused, he made war against them. But he was

defeated a. v. 90, and obliged to make peace with

the Dacians. (Dion Cass, lxvii. 7.) Trajan and

Hadrian kept them in check; but in the reign of

M. Aurelius humilities were recommenced with fresh

energy. The Marcomanni, allied with the Quadi and

others, partly from hatred of the Itomans,and partly

urged on by other tribes pressing upon them in the

north and east, invaded the Roman provinces a. d.

166; and thus commenced the protracted war com­

monly called the Marcomannic or German War, which

lasted until the accession of Commodus, a. d. 180,

who purchased peace of them. During this war,

the Marcomanni and their confederates advanced into

Khaetia, and even penetrated as far as Aquilcia.

The war was not carried on uninterruptedly, but was

divided into two distinct contests, having been inter­

rupted by a peace or truce, in which the places con­

quered on both sides were restored. The second war

broke out towards the end of the reign of M. Aurelius,

about a. d. 178. (Dion Cass. Vragm. lib. lxxi.,

Ixxii., lxxvii. pp. 1178, foil., 1305, ed. Reimar.;

Kutrop. viii. 6; J. Capitol. M. Anton. Philos. 12,

&c, 17,21,22, 25, 27; Amm. Marc. xix. 6; He-

rodian, i. init.) In consequence of the pusillanimity

of Commodus the Marcomannians were so much em­

boldened, that, soon after and throughout the third

century, they continued their inroads into the

Roman provinces, especially Rhaetia and Noricum.

In the reign of Aurvlian, they penetrated into Italy,

even as far as Ancona, and excited great alarm at

Borne. (Vopisc. Aurtl. 18,21.) But afterwards they

cease to act a prominent part in history. Their

name, however, is still mentioned occasionally, as in

Jornandes (22), who sijeaks of them as dwelling on

the west of Transylvania. (Comp. Amm. Marc.

xxii. 5, xxix. 6, xxxi. 4.) In the Notitia Iin]>erii, we

have mention of '* Honoriani Marcomanni scniures"

and "juniorcs" among the Roman auxiliaries. The

last occasion on which their name occurs is in the

history of Attila, among whose hordes Marcomanni

are mentioned. (Comp. Wilhclm, Gennaiuen.y. 212,

foil.; Zeuss, Die DeuUchcn, p. 114, foil.; Latham,

Tacit. Germ. Prolec p. 53, foil.) [L. S.]

MARDYE'NE (Muf8winff PtoL vi. 4. § 3), a

district of ancient Persia, which, according to

Ptolemy, extended to the sea-coast The name is

probably derived from some of the far extended

nomade tribes of the Mardi or Amardi. (HemL i.

125; Strab. xi. p. 524.) [V.]

MARDYK'NI (MopSmpof, Ptol. tL 13 $ 4),

a tribe who occupied the lower part of the Sufdiaa

mountains in Sogdiana, There can be no doubt

that these people are the remains of a once very

numerous race, whose traces we find spread over a

wide extent of country from the Caspian to the

Persian Gulf, and from the Oxus to the Caspian.

We 6nd the names of these tribes preserved in dif­

ferent authors, and attributed to very different

places. Hence the presumption that they war* to

a great extent a nomade tribe, who pressed onward

from the N. and E. to the S. Thus we find them

under the form of Mardi in llyrcania (Diud. xviL

76; Arrian, Anab. iii. 24, iv. 18; Dtonys. Pene£.

v. 732; Curt. vi. 5), in Margiana according to

Pliny (vi. 16. s. 13), in Persia (Herud. L 125;

St nib. xi. p. 524; Ptol. vi. 4. § 3; Curt. r. 6). ia

MARKIA or MA'REA(Mopto, Herod. U. 18,30;

the Mareotic Nome, stood on a peninsula in the suuta

of the lake Mareotis, nearly due south of Alexandma,

and adjacent to the mouth of the canal which em-

nected the lake with the Canopic arm of the Nile.

Under the Pharaohs Mareia was one of the principal

frontier garrisons of Aegypt on the side of Libra;

but from the silence of Herodotus (ii. 30) we may

infer that the Persians did not station truopa there.

In all ages, however, until it was eclipsed by the

neighbouring greatness of Alexandra*, Mareia, a* the

nearest place of strength to the Libyan de**rt, nam*

have been a town of great importance to the Ifelta.

At Mareia, according to Diodorus (ii. 681), Amat-is

defeated the Pharaoh - Apries, Hofra, or Psaminet idi us;

although Herodotus (ii. 161) places this defeat at

Momemphis. (Herod, ii. 169.) At Mareia, alao.

according toThucydidcs(i. 104; comp. Herod.iii. 13),

Iuarus, the son of Psammetichus, reigned, and orga­

nised the revolt of Lower Aegypt against the Persian*.

Under the Ptolemies, Mareia contiuued to nourish ai

a harbour ; but it declined under the Romans, and

in the age of the Antonines —the second century ajx.

—it had dwindled iutoavillage. (Comp,Atheo.i.2,5,

p. 33, with Eustath. ad Homer. Udyu. ix. 197.)

Mareia was the principal depot uf the trade of toe

Mareotic Lake and Nome. The vineyards in r.a

vicinity produced a celebrated wine, which Athenaeus

(/. c.) describes as u remarkable fur its *wt*tw»*,

white in colour, in quality excellent, light, with *

fragrant bouquet: it was by no means astrimrviit,

and did not affect the head.* (Comp. Plin. air. 3;

Strab. xvii. p. 796.) Some, however, deemed the

Mareotic wine inferior to that of AnthylUand Trnia;

and Columella (A'. Ii. iii. 2) says that it was t«x> th a

for Italian palates, accustomed to the foUer.bo4a*d

yet the soil of the vineyards around lb* Uatvutje

beyond the reach of the alluvial deposit of th* Nile,

which is ill suited to viticulture. Strabo (xvu p.
