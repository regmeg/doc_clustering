north-western coast of Norway, the must important

commercial town in that part still bearing the name

of litrgfn. The island of Durnna lastly, which is

mentioned along with those s]>oken of above, lias

been identified with Jhinovn, belonging to the abliey

of Dronthdm. But all this is very doubtful, as

Pliny, besides being very vague, may have blundered

here as in other parts of his work; for, according to

some. Bergion seems to have been an ancient name

of Hibemia or Inland (P. Mel. ii. 5. § 4); and

Diunna is distinctly (ailed by Ptolemy (ii. ."i § 31,

\iii. '3. § 10), an island utV the north of Britain.

p. 300), the modern Ordnnna, near Bilbao; though

by other writers it is variously identified with the

Blanes and the Nerrwn. [T. II. I)."]

KKRVICAXUS TRACTUS, is mentioned in the

Not. Imp. as a continuation of the Armoricanus

Tractus, There is also a middle age authority for

the expression '* Nervici littoris tractus." A port on

tins coast, named Portus Aepatiaii, was guarded by

some Neman troops according to the Notitia.

IVAnville concludes that the Nervii extended from

their inland position to the coast, and had part of it

bet«pen the Morini and the mouth of the Scheldt;

a conclusion for which there is little evidence, and a

good ileal against it. [Mknatii; Morini.] [G.L.]

NE'RVII {Ntpotitot, Ncp€ioi), a nation of Belgiea,

whose capital according to Ptolemy (ii. 9. § 1 1) was

Itatraeuin (Barat). When Caesar was preparing

(n.r, 57) to march against the Belgian confederates,

lie was informed that the Nervii had promised to

Mipply 5o,(M)0 men for the general defence, and

that they were considered the most savage of all the

confederates. (B. G, ii. 4.) The neighbours of the

Nervii on the south were the Ambiani. (B. G. ii.

15.) In Caesar's time the Nervii had not allowed

II mercatores" to come into their country; tfiey

would not let wine be Smarted and other tilings

which encouraged luxury. When Cacsitr had

marched for three days through their territory, he

learned that he was not more than 10 Roman miles

from the Sabis (Samhri), and the Ken ii were

waiting for him on the other side with the Atrebates

and Veromandui, their border people. Thus we

ascertain that the Atrebates, whose chief town is

Arras, and the Veromandui, whose chief place was

.67. Utiaittn, were also neighbours of the Nervii.

1 The Nervii had no cavalry, and their cour.tn

trade almost impenetrable to any attack tr ::s Its

I cavalry of their ncighlxmra by quickset ir'.n

I which a man could not get through, aad «.v*4

, hardly sec through them. (B. G. ii. 17.) On t>

banks of the Sambre Caesar had a d*f<ri!t f.:'t

with the Nervii, commanded by rWuo;:ai*\

During this invasion the old men, the wen.'!!, s:i

'children of the Nervii, were removed to the ae^tuaiv*

I and marshes, somewhere near the cast Ifc

\ Nervii lost a great number of men in this tatt*'

"the nation and the name were nearly ilestr?j*-i'

(/?. G. ii. 27.) Their "senatores * as Caesar nib

them, their thief men, were reduced from 600 ?<>

three, and out of the 60.000 who were in the h*rt>

there were said to be only 500 left capable of beiirf

anus. After this terrible slaughter the NVnii r ^

again in arms against Caesar (b. c. 54), w her lb*;

joined the Eburones and others in the at^ati "0

(Juintus Cicero's camp. (B. G. v. 3S.) Son.e rf ta

commentators have found a difficulty about the *f-

jK'arancc of the Nervii again in b. c. 54, ait^r Ur,:^

been nearly destroyed in n. c 57. We murt

pose that Caesar wrote of the events as th^r in­

curred, and that he did not alter what he bd

written. In B.C. 57 he supposed that he fcil

strayed most of the fighters of the Nervii. In M

54 he found that he was mistaken. In B.c. &

the Nervii were again preparing to give mrcbW 1

the Roman governor; but he tutored their cwntr

in the winter season, and before they had rixel

rally or to escape, he took many prisoner?. dn"-w (

many head of cattle, and ravaged their land. »M1

compiled them to come to terms. (B.G.^ii

When the meeting of the Gallic states in b cl

was settling the forces that each nation should *H

to the relief of Alesia, the contingent of the Sal

was 5000 men. (B. G. vii. 75.)

Some of the nations between the Stiw, tie >

and the Rhine, were Germans in Caesars time,

these Germans were invaders. The N<rrvu ill

Gtrm. c. 28) claimed a Germanic origin, and tl

may have been a German or a mixed German I

I Gallic race; but there is no evidence wb'.c'j i

settle the question. Appian (de BtlL Gad i

| speaks of the Nervii as descendants of the Tea'i

and Cimbri ; but this is worth very little. At-?

had probably no authority except Caesar, wb-«i

| used carelessly; and he may have applied M

1 Nervii what Caesar says of the origin of tbt A

atuci. (Zf. G. ii. 29.) ' Strabo (p. I94> ab» J

j that the Nervii were a Germanic nati »n. b«: t* i

not even know tlie position of the Nervii,

misplaces them.

Caesar mentions some smaller tribes as depru

on the Nervii {B. G. v. 39) : these tribes wrrv On

Levaci, PJeumoxii, Geiduni, of ail wh;ini wt t

nothing.

Pliny (iv. 17) mentions in Bclcioa « in!

people, the Castolop (apj«arently a crmf-ied «■!

Atrebates, Nervii liberi, Veromandui; an o-1^

enumeration which corresj«onds witfi the

dui ; for the chief place of the Atrvbato »-4rri

the Nervii Barai, and of the Veromandui A-

[Arr.l'STA VtfROMAHDUORUM.] As Pltiy

the Nervii liberi, we must suppose that in hi*

they were exempt from the payment of taies W

Romans, and retained their own internal £tf

:nent; probably in Pliny's time the Kturtan* ta

yet fully reduced their country.
