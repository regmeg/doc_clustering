TRACHY. TRAJANOPOLIS. 1219

Imt (Joseph. Ant. xrii. 8. § 1, B. J. ii. 6. §3);

at it subsequently formed put of the dominion of

ieralts Agrippa. (Joseph. Ant. xviii. 6. § 10, B.

'. iii. 3. § 5; Philo, Opp. ii. p. 593.)

Tbt whole district his been recently explored and

tamioed with mnch care and judgment by the Rev.

1_ Porter of Damascus, who has shown that the |

Ml accounts of this province, properly weighed,

mncide with remarkable accuracy with what we

arm of it now. According to him, it most hare

mi to the NW. of Batanaea, and have extended

l>w; the stony tract at the base of the Jtbel Hau-

as, u Kenath (now Kunatctit) was a city of Tra-

bun (Eoseb. OnomatL t. v. Canatli), while the

mrnms extend it, though improbably, as far S. as

'*<tra. Mr. Porter observes that the name is some-

ices applied in a more general sense by ancient

men, so as to include the neighbouring provinces

a is Luie, iii. 1, where the " Region of Trachonitis"

i< be understood as embracing Batanaea and

unnitis; Joseph. Ant. xvii. 14. § 4.) Ue thinks,

0. that the plain on the western side as far as the

'aj road was embraced in Trachonitis, and likewise

m on the north to the Jebel Khhjarah, with a

ittHtierable section of the plain on the east, N. of

f.l-al-Batkanytk. The Argoh of Numb, xxxiv.

1, I Kingt, iv. 13, &c, Mr. Porter considers to be

e ura district as Trachonitis, the latter being the

nrk rendering of the Hebrew form. (Porter, Fice

TRAENS or TRAIS (Tpdeii or Tp<U»r, -«i-rot:

■"•sto), a river of Bruttium celebrated for the san-

inary defeat of the Sybarites on its banks by their

ili the Crotooials, which led to the destruction of

- city of Sybaris, B. c 510. (Iambi. Vit rglh.  
240.) It at singular that the banks of a stream

urh had been the scene of such a catastrophe

ioal be again selected by the remnant of the

'untes who were expelled from the new colony of

irii shortly after its foundation [TnuKIl] for the

» <«f their settlement. They, however, did not

uin Vang, being expelled and put to the sword by

t neighbouring barbarians, whom Diodorus by a

r.arkable anachronism calls Bruttians, apparently

Inn a few years of their establishment. (Diod.

. 23.) Tbe name of the river is not found in

r '< the geographers, but there can be little doubt

li< being the one still called the Trionto, which

i into the gulf of Tarentum a few miles E. of

■mm, and gives name also to an adjoining head-

1 UA'GIA (T»o>i'o), also called Tragiae (Tpo-

->). Trmgia, Tracaeae (Tpayaieu), or Tragaea (Too.  
a), a small island off tbe south coast of Samos,

r which Pericles, in B. c. 440, defeated the Sa­

na in a naval engagement. (Thncyd. i. 116;

a. r*. 71, T. 135; Pint. Per. 25; Strab. xiii. p.

rKA'GILUS (Tpd-yiAoi: Elk. Tpaytheii, Stcph.

he BVxrviAoi or Ao<ryiAov found in Hierocles (p.

') among tbe towns of the first or consular Mace-

at. In tbe Table there is a place "Triulo"

marked as 10 miles from Philippi. This is ap­

parently a corruption of " Traelio," since numerous

coins (one of which is figured below) bare been found

near Amphipolis with tho inscription TRAIAIflN.

Leake conjectures with much probability that the

real name was Tragilus, and that in the local form

of the name the r may have been omitted, so that

the TPAIAIQN of the coin may represent the Hel­

lenic TpayMav. (Eckhel, vol. ii. p. 81; Leake,

Northern Greece, vol. iii. p. 228.)

COIII OP TRACilLUS OR TIIAKULS.

TRAGU'RIUM (Tftxyovptor, Strab., Ptol.; Tpa-

yipior, Polyb.), an important town of Dalmatia,

situated upon an island, which was separated from

the mainland by an artificial canal. According to

the Antonine Itinerary, it was distant 16 miles from

Praelorium and 13 from Salons*. Pliny calls it

44 Tragnrium rivium Ilomanorum," and says that it

was celebrated for its marble. Its name is preserved

in tho modem Trim. (Polyb. xxxii. 18 ; Strab. ii.

p. 124, vii. p. 315; Ptol. ii. 17. § 14; Plin. iii. 22.

s. 26; Mela, ii. 3; //. At.: p. 272; Tub. Peut.;

Geogr. Rav. iv. 16.)

TRAGUS. [Cai-iiyak.]

TRAIA CAPITA (/tin. Ant p. 399), more

correctly Tula Cai-ita (Geog. Rav. v. 3), since

it lay near the three mouths of the Iberus, a town

of the Cosetani, in Hispania Tarraconensis, between

Pertosa and Tarraro. Variously identified with

7iri*a and Torre del Aliga. [T. H. D.]

TRAJA'NI Ml NT .Ml M I'M. a tort or castle

built by Trajan on the southern bank of the river

Mnenus, not far from its junction with the Rhenus.

(Amm. Marc. xvii. 1.) The site is uncertain, nor is it

known what the Munimentum reallv was. [L. S.]

TRAJA'NI PORTUS. [Ootia.]

TRAJANO'POLIS (Tf>oi<mlwoAi»), a town in

Mysia, in the district occupied by the tribe of the

Thraemenothyritae, on the frontiers of Phrygia.

(Ptol. v. 2. §'§ 14, 15.) The Cilician city of Se-

linus also for a time bore the name of Trajanopnlis.

[Seuscs.] [L. S.]

TRAJANO'POLIS (TpaIo»owoAn), an important

town in the S. of Thrace, which was probably founded

by or in honour of the emperor Trajan, about tbe

time when Plolinopolis was founded, to perpetuate

the name of his wife Plotina. Its exact site appears

to be somewhat doubtful. Some authorities describe

it as situated on the right bank of the Hebrus, near

the pass in the range of Mount Rhodope, through

which that river flows, and about 40 miles from its

mouth. Now this is the site of the modem Ori-

khova, with which accordingly it is by some identi­

fied. It would be difficult, however, to reconcile this

with the various distances given in the Itineraries:

e. g. Trajanopolis is stated to be 9000 pices from

Tempyra, and 29,000 from Cypsela; whereas the

site above mentioned is nearly equidistant from those

assigned to Tempyra and Cypaela, being, howerer,

more distant from the former. Bnt this is only on*

example out of many showing how extremely imper­

fect is our knowledge of the geography of Thrace,

both ancient and modem. In the map of the Society
