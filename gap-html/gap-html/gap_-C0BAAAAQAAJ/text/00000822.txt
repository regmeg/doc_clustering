.Slc.*' (Beschr. i. (190. cf. p. 148.) Hut to say

that tin; name of Arrive* was derived from other

Arrives can hardly be what tlie aulltor intended.

Besides, the sense is disjointed; tor the relative guU

(wrongly translated "of these parts of the city")

cannot I>e made to refer to an antecedent that is

separated from it by a long sentence. As the text

stands, quia must necessarily refer to Argeos in the

sentence immediately preceding. It might be thought

that tins sentence has been interpolated, since Varro

called an Arrive Argus, not Argivus. "Itaque dict-

mus' hie Argus' cum hominemdicimus;cumoppidum,

Graecanice 'hoc Argos,' cum Latine, 'Argei.' (/>.£.

ix. §89, Mull.) We see from this passage that the more

ancient Latin name for the town of Argos was A rgei

(masc. plur.), and hence it might be inferred to be

Livy's meaning that the chapels were called Argos

or Argoses, not Argivs. Hut Argri, in still more

ancient Latin than that of Varro, was also the name

for Argives as we find from a verse which he quotes

from Ennius (vii. § 44); —

'; Libaque, fictores, Argeos ct tutulatos ;M

whence we are disposed to think that the name of

Argives, however anomalous the usage may appear,

was really applied to the>e chapels, just as a modern

Italian calls a church S. Pktro or S. Paolo, and

that the meaning of Varro in the second sentence of

the passage quoted, is: "It is thought that these

Argoi (i. e. the sacraria so called) were named

after the chiefs who came to Rome with the Argive

Hercules;" in which manner Varro would coincide

with Livy in making these Arge'i places. How else,

too, shall we explain Ovid {Fast. iii. 791) : —

"Itur ad Argeos, qui slnt sua pagina dicet?"

And in like maimer Masurius Sabinus, quoted by

Gellius (iV. A. x. 15): "Atque etiam cum (Fla-

minica) it ail Argeos." A passage in Paul us Dia-

conus throws a gleam of light upon the matter;

though, with more grammatical nicety than know­

ledge of antiquity, lie has adopted, apparently from

the Greek, a neuter form unknown to any other

writer: "Argea loca appellantur Komae, quod in

Ids scpulti assent quidnin Argivorum illustres viri."'

(p. 19, Miill.) Hence it appears that these chapels

were the (reputed) burial places of these Arrive

heroes, and their masculine appellation thus gains

still further probability. "K quts," &c. would mean,

therefore, that the different Jservian Regions were

marked oil'and named according to these chapels.

We have already remarked that though Varro

mentions 27 of the^c chapels, he enumerates only

24. Hence Becker {IJandb. p. 386), as well as

Runsen, are of opinion that the three odd ones

were upon the Capitol. The only reason assigned

for this conjecture is that the hill had three

natural divisions two heights with a depression

between them. Hut if we have rightly explained

Varro's meaning, it is impossible that the Capitol

should have had any of these ehaj>els. Blinsen,

however, goes still further, and, connecting the

chapels with the Argive men of straw which were j

annually precipitated into the Tilter, thinks that;

their numher might have been 30. allotting the

remaining three to the ancient Cat/ito! on tbf Qt-

rinal, although Varro had already aceoant*l fw t*
