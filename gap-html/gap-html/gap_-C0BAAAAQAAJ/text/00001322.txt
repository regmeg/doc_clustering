TUCRIS (TovKpis. Ptol. ii. 6. § 56), a town of

the Arevaci in Hispania Tarraconensis [T. H. D.]

TUDE (ToSSat and Tovvdat, Ptol. ii. 6. $ 45), a

fort or castle of tlie Gruii or Grav'ii, in Hispania

Tarraconensis, K. of Limia, and on the road from

Bracara to Asturica. (/tin. Aid. p. 4'2'J.) It is

called Tyde by Pliny (iv. 20. s. 34), and according

to an ancient tradition it was the seat of an Aetolian

colony under Diomed; a tale probably occasioned by

the similarity of its name to that of Tydcus. (SiL

Ital. iii. 367, xvi. 309; Plin. /.c.; Avien. Dttcr.

Orb. 650.) It is the modern Tuy. [T. H. !>.]

TUDER (TovScp: Eth. Tudertinua: Totli), one

of the most considerable cities of Umbria, situated

on a lofty hill, rising above the left bank of the

Tiber, about 26 miles S. of Perusia and 18 W. of

Spoletium. There is no doubt that it was an ancient

Umbriun city, but no mention of the name occurs in

history previous to the Roman conquest. .Sitins

ltalicus tells us that it was celebrated for the worship

of Mars (Sil. Ital. iv. 222, viii. 462), and notices

its position on a lofty bill. (Id. vi. 645.) The

first notice of it in history is on occasion of a pro­

digy which occurred there at the time of the inva­

sion of the Cimbri and Tcutones (Pint. Mar. 17;

Plin. ii. 57. s. 58); and shortly after we learn that

it was taken by Crassus, as the lieutenant of Sulla,

during the wars of the latter with the partisans

of Marias. (1'lut. Crass. 6.) It received a colony

under Augustus, and assumed the title of il Colonia

Fhla Tuder," probably in consequence of some ser­

vices rendered during the Peruvian War, though its

name is not mentioned by Appian. (Plin. iii. 14. s. 19;

Lib. Colon, p. 214; Murat. Inner, pp. 1111.4, 1120.

3; Orell. hiscr. 3726.) It appears from inscriptions

to have been a flourishing and important town under

the Roman Empire, and is mentioned by all the geo­

graphers among the chief towns of Umbria. (Strab.

v. p. 227; Plin. I.e.; Ptol. iii. 1. § 54.) It was

not situated on the Flaminian Way, but the Tabula

gives a line of road, which led from Amelia to

Tuder, and thence to Perusia. (Tab. Pent.) Its

great strength as a fortress, arising from its elevated

position, is already alluded to by Strabo ((, c ). and

rendered it a place ot' importance during the Gothic

Wars, after the fall of the Western Empire. (Procop.

j5. G. ii. 10, 13.) It is again mentioned as a city

under the Lombards (P. Oiac. iv. 8); and there can

be no doubt that it continued throughout the middle

ages to be a considerable city. It is now much de­

cayed, and has only about 2500 inhabitants, but

still retains the title of a city.

Considerable ancient remains still attest it.s former

consideration. Among these the most remarkable

are the walls of the city, some portions of which are

apparently of great antiquity, resembling those of

Perusia, Volaterrae, and other Etruscan cities, but

they are in general more regular and less rude.

Other parts of the walls, of which three distinct cir­

cuits may be traced, are of regular masonry and

built of travertine. These are certainly of Roman

date. '1 here are also the remains of an ancient

building, called by local antiquarians the temple of

Mars, but more probably a basilica of Roman date.

Numerous coins and other small objects have been

ibund at Todi; among the latter the most interesting

is a bronze statue of Mars, now in the Museo Grc-

gyriano at Rome. The coins uf Tuder, which are

numerous, belong to th© class called A* fa*

being of brass and of large rw*m;i?: a

earliest coinage of Volaterrae. IgofiaB, Ju: Tyr

all have the name writ'tn in tiro.-cafi cavrti

tvtere, which wo tuaa learn to t*f .e

native form of the name. [LH.&:
