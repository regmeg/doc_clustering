429 NESLLIUM. NICAEA.

12. § 2, iii. 13. § 7; Miorot, Zonar. ix. 28: Sato,

Turkish Kartuit), the river which constituted the

boundary of Thmce and Macedonia in the time of

Philip and Alexander, an arrangement which the

Romans continued on their conquest of the latter

country. (Strab. rii. p. 331 j'Lir. xlv. 29.) Thn-

cydides (ii. 96) states that it took its rise in Mt.

Scoiiiius, whence the Hebrus descended; being, in

fact, that cluster of great summits between Chita-

tendil and S<fai, which sends tributaries to all the

great rivers of the N. of Eunipean Turkey. It

discharged itself into the sea near Abdera. (Herod,

vii. 109; cmnp. Theoplirast. II. P. iii. 2; Leake,

Northern Greece, vol. iii. p. 215.) [E. B. J.]

NESU'LIUM (NTjiroiiAio*), a harbour on the coast

of Ctlicia. between Celenderis and Seleucia, 60 Btadia

east of Mylac. (Stadinrmui Star. Mag. §§ 166,

167.) [L.S.]

NETO'PHAH (N»Ta>£«i),a town of Judah, men­

tioned by Ezra (ii. 22) and Nehemiah (vii. 26), be­

tween Bethlehem and Anathoth, if anything can lie

concluded from the order in which the names occur,

which is so questionable, that Beit-Nettif may be,

perhaps, safely regarded as its modem represen­

tative. It is situated on the highest point of a lofty

ridge, towards the NW. of the ancient tribe of

Judah. (Robinson, Bib. Re*, vol. ii. pp. 341 —

347; Roland, Paheetina. pp. 650, 909.) [O. W.]

NF.TUM or NEETUM (Nrnro.., Ptol. iii. 4.

§ 13; Netnm, Cic, Sil. IUl.i Eth. Netinus, Cic,

Plin.: Soto Vccchio), a considerable town in the 8.

of Sicily, near the sources of the little river Asi-

narus (f'alconaru), and about 20 miles 8\V. of Sy­

racuse. We find no mention of it in early times,

but it was probably subject to Syracuse; and it is

in accordance with this, that, by the treaty con­

cluded in B. c. 263 between the Romans and Hieron

king of Syracuse, Neetum was noticed as one of the

ciries left in subjection to that monarch. (Diod.

xxiii. Exc. H. p. 502.) We have no account of

the circumstances which subsequently earned for

the Netini the peculiarly privileged position in which

we afterwards find them: but in the days of Cicero

Netnm enjoyed the rights of a "foederata civitiia"

like Me-ssana and Tauromenium; while, in Pliny's

time, it still retained the rank of a Latin town

(ciritas iMtinae conHitvmie). a favour then enjoyed

by only three cities in the island. (Cic. Verr. iv.

26, v. 22, 51 ; Plin. iii. 8. s. 14; Ptol. I c.; Sil.

Itil. xiv. 268.) Ptolemy is the last ancient writer

that mentions the name; but there is no doubt that

it continued to exist throughout the middle ages;

and under the Norman kings rose to be a place of

great importance, and the capital of the southern

province of Sicily, to which it gave the name of

Vol di Soto. But having suffered repeatedly

from earthquakes, the inhabitants were induced to

emigrate to a site nearer the sea, where they founded

the modern city of A'ofo, in 1703. The old site,

which is now known as Soto Yecchio, waa on the

summit of a lofty hill about 8 miles from the

modem town and 12 from the sea-coast: some re­

mains of the ancient amphitheatre, and of a building

called a gymnasium, are still visible, and a Greek

inscription, which belongs to the time of Hieron II.

(Fa/rll. de Reb. Sk. iv. 2; Castell. Inter. Siril. p.

101.) [E. H. B.J ■

N EllDRUS (Nttipot, Arrian, Indie, c. 4). a small

stream of the Panjtib, which flowed into tho Hy-

draules {Rati or Iravati) from the country of the

Attaceni. It has not been identified with any modern

river. [V.]

NEVIRNUM [Novionrxr*.]

XKl'RI (N«i>pol). a nomad people of the Jt. tf

Europe, whom Herodotus (iv. 17, 51, 10O. Vii)

places in the centre of the region which now cam-

prises Poland anil Lithuania, about the rirer-tausa

of the Bug. They occupied the district (rye

NfoplS* yijy) which lay to the NW. of the Uk* oat

of which the Tyrus rises, and which still boars the

name in Slavonic of Surtkazemja, with its chW

town Snr, and a river SwreU. Some time before

the expedition of Dareiut, they had been obliged t*

quit their original seats, on account of a quantity of

serpents with which it was infested, and had taken

refuge with the Budini in the district about the

Bug, which had till then belonged to that people.

Though not of the same origin, in,customs they

resembled the Scythians, and bore the reputation of

being enchanters (•/Anns'), like the "Srhamai *

among the Siberian nomads of the present day.

Once a year—so the Scythians and the Greeks of

Olbia told Herodotus—each of them became for a

few days a wolf; a legend which still linger* among

the people of Volhynia and White Ruuia. Pum-

ponius Mela (ii. 1. §§ 7, 13) repeats this story from

Herodotus. (Comp. Plin. viii. 34; Creuxer, Symbolit,

vol. ii. p. 131.) The Sarmatian Navari of Ptolemy

(Nauapoi, iii. 5. § 25) are the same as the Nrori,

the name appearing in a Grecized form; but there is

some difficulty in harmonising his statement*, as

well as those of Euphorus (ao. Anon. Poet. (rWyo

Scymn. Ch.), v. 843; Anon. I'eriiil. p. 2) and of

Ammianus Marcellinus (xxxi. 2. §14), with th*

more trustworthy accounts of Herodotus. Schafank

(Slav. Alt. vol. L pp. 194—199) refim the Neuri

to the Wendish or Servian stock. [E. B. J.]

NIA (Ni'o), a river of Interior Libya, discharging

itself into the Hesperian bav, in 13" 30' E. lone- and

90° N. lat. (Ptol. iv. 6. § 7). Colonel Leake (Jo*m.

Gtog. Soc. vol. ii. p. 18) has identified it with the

Rio Grande, which takes its rise on the border uf the

highland of Senegambia, according to Mollien'• map

(7'rar. in the Interior of Africa, 1820), m 10*

37' N. lat. and 13° 37' W. long. [K. B. J.]

NIGAE, NICE (Men), or NICAEA (NArcua),

a town of Thrace, not far from Adrianopje, the trroe

of the defeat and death of the emperor Valms by

the Goths in A. d. 378. (Amm. MarcelL xxxi. 13:

Cedren. ii. p. 183; Sozom. iv. 19; Tbeoph. p. 771.)

It has been variously identified with Kuleli arai

Kululeu. [T. H. D.]

NICAEA. I. In Alia. 1. (Nimta;Eth. Kutiw

or NiKaet'f: Iihnifc), one of the most important tnwna

of Bithynia, of which Strabo (xii. p. 565) even rails

it the metropolis, waa situated on the eastern ib>»*

of lake Ascania or Ascanius, in a wide and ferula

plain, which, however, was somewhat unhealthy m

summer. The place is said to have been coluuisxl by

Bottiaeana, and to have originally bom* the msii of

Anoore (Strph. B. i. r.) or Helieore (Gengr. Jsfaa.

p. 40, ed. Hudson); but it waa subsequently dnrtrmd

by the Mysiana. A few years after the death of

Alexander the Great, Antigonus, probably after ha

victory over Eumenea, in B. a 316, rebuilt the town,

and called it, after himself, Antigoneta. (Sirph. B.

I. c.; Eustath. ad Horn. 1L ii. 863). Not tone after

Lysimachus, having made himself master of a great

part of Asia Minor, changed the name of Anti^ooeia

into Nirnea, in honour of bis wife Xicara, a daughter

of Antipater. (Steph. B., Eustath., Sink, U. ec)
