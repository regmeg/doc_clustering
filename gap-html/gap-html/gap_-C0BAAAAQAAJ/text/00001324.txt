TURNACUM or TORNACUM, a city of North

Gallia, is first mentioned in the Roman Itins. In

the Notit. Imp. mention is made of a military force

under the name of Numerus Turnacensium; and of

a "P roc orator Gynaecii Tornacensis Belgicae Se-

cundae." This procurator is explained to be a super­

intendent of some number of women who were

employed in making clothing for the soldiers. Hie-

ronymus about a. i>. 407 speaks of Tumacnni

as one of the chief towns of Gallia ; and Audocnus,

iu his life of 8. Eligius (St. Eloi) in the seventh

century, says of it, "quae quondam regalis extitit

civitas." Tarnacum was within the limits of the

ancient territory of the Xervii. The Flemish name

is JJoornick; which the French hive corrupted into

Tournai. Tournai is on the Scheldt-, in the pro­

vince of Hainault, in the kingdom of Belgium.

There are silver corns of Turnacum, with the

legend dvknacos and dvknacvs. On one side

there is the head of an armed man, and on the

other a horseman armed. On some there is said to

be the legend dvbno hex. Numerous Roman

medals have been found at Tournai, some of the

time of Augustus and others as late as Claudius Go-

thicus and Tetricus, and even of a later date. The

tomb of Clulderic I., wdio died a. d. 481, was dis­

covered at Tournai in the seventeenth century, and

a vast quantity of gold and .silver medals, and other

curious things ; among which was the golden ring

nf Childeric, with his name on it, CHILDIRICI

kkois. Such discoveries as these, which have been

made in various places in Belgium, show how little

we know of the Roman history of this country.
