HASSTLI. 295 MATIENI MOXTES.

in E. king. 14° 30', N. lat. 6° 20'. It has been

identified with the Gambia, which ran be no other

than the ancient Stachir or Trachir; one of the rivers

which flow into the Atlantic, between the A'ama-

ranca and the Mesurada, is tie probable repre­

sentative of the Massitholus. [E. B. J.]

MASSYLL [Numidia.]

MASTAURA (Mitrravpa). a town in the north

of Caii*. at the foot of Mount Messogis, on the

small river Chrysaoras, between Tralles and Tri­

poli*. (Strab. xiv. p. 650; Plin. v. 31; Stcph. B.

*. p.; HierocL p. 659.) The town was not of any  
great repute, but is interesting from its extant

coins, and from the fact that the ancient site is still

marked by a village bearing the name Mastaura,

near which a few ancient remains are found. (Ha­

milton, Researches, i. p. 531.) [L. S.]

MASTE (Moo-ni ipos, Ptol. iv. 7. § 26), a moun­

tain farming part of the Abyssinian highlands,

a little to the east of the Lunac Montcs, lat. 10° 59'

N., long. 36° 55' E. The sources of the Astapus,

Bahr-el-Atrek, Blue or Dark river, one of the ori­

ginal tributaries of the Nile, if not the Nile itself, are

supposed to be on the N. side of Mount Maste.

They are three springs, regarded as holy by the

natives, and though not broad are deep. Bruce,

( Trued*, vol. iii. p. 308) visited Mount Maste, and

was the first European who had ascended it for

seventy years. The tribes who dwelt near the foun­

tains of the Bahr-el-Acrek were called Mastitae

(MooTrrm, Ptol. iv. 5. § 24, 7. § 31), and there was

a town of the same name with the mountain (Mdarr)

wiAis, PtoL iv. 7. § 25). [W. B. D.]

MASTIA'NI (Mao-riayof), a people on the south

roast of Spain, cast of the Pillars of Hercules, to

whom the town of Mastia (Maori'a) belonged.

They were mentioned by Hecataens (Steph. B. 8. v,

Vlatmarvi) and Polybius (iii. 33), but do not oc­

cur in later writers. Hannibal transported a part of

them to Africa. (Polyb. I. c.) Mastia appears to

be the same as Massia (Maffffio), which Theopom-

pas described as a district bordering upon the

Tartessians. (Steph. B. s. v. Mcurcrfa.) Hecataens

also assigned the following towns to this people:

Maknoboka (Steph. B. ». r. Kcuv6Gwpa), pro­

bably the same as the later Maenoba ; Slxus (2t(ur,

S«eph. B. a. r.), probably the same as the later Sex,

or Hexi; Molybdajia (MoAvSSdva, Steph. B.

r. ».) : and Stalib (SvaAir, Steph. B. t. v.), pro­

bably the later Suel.

MASTRA'MELA (MaorpaM&n, Steph. B.«. v.),

"» city and lake in Celtice," on the authority of

Artemidorus. This is the Astromela of the MSS.

of Pliny [Fossa Mariana, p. 912]. The name

Martnunela also occurs in Avienus (Ora Marilima,

v. 692). It is one of the lakes on the eastern side

of the Delta of the Rhone, but it is uncertain which

it ij. the E'tang de Bern or the E'tang de Mar-

ti(p*ei. It is said that there is a dry port of some

me in the middle of the E'Umg de Caronte, and that

this dry part is still called Malestraou. [G. L.]

MASTU'SIA (Mootouo-io tucpa: Capo Greco"),

the promontory at the southern extremity of the

Thracian Chersonesus, opposite to Sigenm. A little

It the east of it was the town of Elaens. (Ptol.

iii. 12. § 1; Plin. iv. 18; Mela, ii. 21; Tzetz. ad

Lyv/pS. 534. where it is called Mafouola.) The

mountain in Ionia, at the foot of which Smyrna was

bait, likewise bore the name of Mastusia. (Plin.

v.31.) [L. S.]

MASCRA (MaVowpa), a place between Attalia

and Perge in Pamphylia (Stadium. §§ 200, 201),

and 70 stadia from Mygdala, which is probably a

corruption of Magydus. [Magyuis.] [L. S.]

MATALA PR. [Natalia.]

MATA'LIA (MoToAla, rtol.iii. 17. § 4), a town

in Crete near the headland of Matala (MaraAa,

Stadiasm.), and probably the same place as the

naval arsenal of Gortyna, Metali.um (M«VaAAoi/,

Strab. x. p. 479), as it appears in our copies of

Strabo, but incorrectly. (Comp. Groskurd, ad foe.)

The modern name in Mr. Pashley's map is Matala.

(Hock, Arete, vol. i. pp. 399,435;Mus. Class. Antiq.

vol. ii. p. 287.) [E. B. .T.]

MATEOLA, a town of Apulia, mentioned only by

Pliny (iii. 11. s. 16) among the inland cities of that

province. It is evidently the same now called Afa-

tera about 12 miles from Ginosa (Genusium), and

27 from the gulf of Tarentum. It is only about

8 miles from the river Bradanus, and must there­

fore have been closely adjoining the frontier of

Lucania. [E. H. B.]

MATAVO, or MATAVONIUM, as D'Anville

has it, in Gallia Narbonensis, is placed by the

Antonine Itin. on a road from Forum Voconii [Fo-

kum Voconti] to Massilia (Marseille), 12 M. P.

from Forum Voconii and 14 from Ad Turres

(Tourres), between which places it lies. It is also

in the Table, but the distances are not the same.

Matavo is supposed to be Vms. [G. L.]

MATERENSE OPPIDUM, one of the thirty free

towns (" oppida libera," Plin. v. 4) of Zeugitana. It

still retains the ancient name, and is the modem

Matter in the government of Tunis,— a small vil­

lage situated on a rising ground in the middle of a

fruitful plain, with a rivnlet a little below, which

empties itself into the Sisura Palus. (Shaw, Trav.

p. 165; Barth, Wanderungen, p. 206.) [E. B. J.]

MATE'RI (MaTT/poi; some MSS. read MaTrjvoi,

Ptol. v. 9. § 17), a people of Asiatic Sarmatia, to

the E. of the river Rha. [E. B. J.]

MATERNUM, a town of Etruria, known only

from the Tabula Peutingeriana, which plftces it on

the Via Clodia, between Tuscania (Toscanella) and

Satumia, 12 miles from the former, and 18 from the

latter city. It probably occupied the same site as

the modern village of Farnese. (Cluver. Ital. p. 517;

Dennis, Etruria. vol. i. p. 463.) [E. H. B.]

MATIA'NA (MoTiawj, Strab. ii. p. 73, xi. p. 509;

Steph. B.: Motit)!^, Herod, v. 52: Elh. Ma-nai'o'r,

Mannvo's), a district of ancient Media, in the

south-western part of its great subdivision called

Media Atropatene, extending along the mountains

which separate Armenia and Assyria. Its bound­

aries are very uncertain, and it is not possible to

determine how far it extended. It is probably

the same as the MapTiaWj of Ptolemy (vi. 2.

§ 5). [Martiane.] Strabo mentions as a pe­

culiarity of the trees in this district, that they

distil honey (I. c). The Matiani are included by

Herodotus in the eighteenth satrapy of Dareius

(iii. 94), and served in the army of Xerxes, being

armed and equipped in the same manner as the

Paphlagonians (vii. 72). Herodntus evidently con­

sidered them to occupy part of the more widely

extended territory of Armenia, [V.]

MATIE'NI MONTES (to: Manrjro o>n, Herod,

i. 1S9. 202, v. 52), the ridge of mountains which

forms the back-bone or centre of Matiana, doubtless

part of the mountain range of Kurdistan, in the

neighbourhood of Vtfn. Herodotus makes them tlio

watershed from which flowed the Gyndes and tho
