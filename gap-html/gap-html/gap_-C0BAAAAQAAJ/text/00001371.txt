VIA AEMILIA. VIA AEMILIA. 1287

place soon after the complete subjugation of the

Transpadane Gauls. Nor do we know with any

certainty whether the name of Via Aemilia was ever

applied in common usage to this portion of the road,

or to the branches that led from Mediolanum to the

font of the Alps, as well as from that city by Verona

to l'atavium. Bat as Strabo distinctly applies the

name to the branch that led by l'atavium to Aqui­

leia.. we may here most conveniently include all the

principal highroads of the N. of Italy under one

view in the present article.

1. The main or trunk line of the Via Aemilia

from Ariminam to Placentia. The stations on this

r'-a*i are thus given in the Antnnine Itinerary, where

ttwr are repeated more than once (pp.99, 126, 287);

anal, from the direct line of the road, the distances are

subject to no doubt :—

From Ariminam (Rimini) to

Caesena (tesewi) ... xx. M. P.

Fa vent ia (Faema) - xxiv.

Forum Cornelii (Imola) - - x.

Dononia (Bologna) - - - xxiv.

Matina (Mixicna) ... xxv.

Kegium (Reggio) .... xvii.

Parma (Parma) - - - - xviii.

Fidenliula (BorgoS. Donino) xv.

Placentia (J'iactnza) - xxiv.

The same line is given more in detail in the Jeru­

salem .Itinerary (p. 615, flee), with which the

Taatola substantially agrees; but the distances arc

mure correctly given in the latter.

The stations enumerated are:—

Competu (/. II.) Ad Com-

fluentes (Tab.) - - - xii. JtP.

Oaesena (Ctxcna) - - - - viii.

Forum Populii (Forlimpopoli) vii.

Forum Livii (Forli) - - - vii.

Fa vent ia (Faenza) - - - X.

Forum Cornelii (Imola) - - x.

Clatema (Quoderna) - - xir.

Bononia (Bologna) X.

Forum Gallorum .... xvii.

Hutina (Modena) ... viii.

Kegium (Reggio) ... xvii.

Tannetnm (Tone to) • - - xi.

Parma (Parma) .... vii.

Fidentia ( Borgo S. Donino) xv.

Florentia (Firemuola) x.

Placentia (Piacenza) - - - XT.

The general agreement in the distances above given

(which are those of the Tabula) with those of the

Antonine Itinerary, though the division is different,

ntly shows the accuracy of the two. The dis-

in the Jerusalem Itinerary are, for this line of

route, generally less accurate. Some obscure Muta-

mentioned in the one document, and not in the

, have been omitted in the above list.

2. Continuation of the Via Aemilia from Placentia

Mediolanum. This line is summarily given in the

ine Itinerary thus:—

From Placentia to Laus

I'ompeia (Lodi Vecchio) - xxiv. M. P.

Tbence to Mediolanum ( Milan) xvi.

The same distances are thus divided in the Jeru-

Itirjerary:—

Ad Kolas - • • • - - xi. M. p.

TresTabemae .... v.

Laus ...... viii

Ad Nonnm ..... vii.

Mediolanum ----- vii. (ix. ?)

are unknown, and arc

expressly called mere Mutationes, or places for

changing horses.

3. From Mediolanum to Augusta Praetoria, at

the foot of the Alps, the distances, as given in the

Antonine Itinerary, are :—

From Mediolanum to

Novaria (iVnrara) - -

Vercellae (Vercelli) - -

Eporedia (Icrea) - -

Vitricium (Verrez) - -

Augusta Praetoria (Aosta)

The same authority gives a circuitous line of route

from Mediolanum to Vercellae (where it rrjoins the

preceding) by

Ticinum (Pavia) ... xxii. M. p.

Ijiuincllum (Lometto) - - xxii.

Vercellae (Verctlli) ... xxvi.

4. From Mediolanum to Aquileia. The i

given in the Itineraries are as follows:—

Med. to Argcntia - - - - x. u. p.

Pons Aureoli (Pontirolo) x.

Bergamum (Bergamo) - xiii.

xxxiii. m. p.

(In the above line of route the minor stations

(Mutationes) given in the Jerusalem Itinerary are

omitted. For an examination of them, and a careful

of all the Roman roads through Cisalpine

see Walckenaer, Geographic da Gaulcs,

vol. iii. pp. 2—13.)

5. From Bononia to Aquileia. This is the road

of which Strabo expressly speaks as a continuation of

the Via Aemilia (v. p. 217), but it is probable that

he did not mean to say that it branched off directly

from Bononia; at least the only line given in the

Itineraries turns off from the main line of the Via

Aemilia at Mntina, and thence proceeds to

Vicus Serninus (?) ... xxiii. M. P.

Vicus Varianus (Bariano, on

the N. bank of the Po) . xx.

Anneianum (Legnagot) - - xvii.

Ateste (Kite) ..... xx.

Patavium (Padoea) ... xxv.

whence it followed the same line to Aquileia as

that given above. Another line of road, which though

more circuitous was probably more frequented, led

from Mulina by Colicaria (an uncertain station) to

linstilia (Ottiglia). where it crossed the Padus, and

thence direct to Verona (xxx. M. P.). (Itin. Ant.

p. 282.)

6. From Placentia to Dertona, where it commu­

nicated with the road constructed by Aemilins Scau-

rus across the Apennines to Vada Sabata. (Strab.

v. p. 217.) The stations on this short line were:—

From Placentia to

Comillomagus- .... xxv. at. r.

lria (Voghcra) .... xvi

Dertona (Tortnna) x.

The first station, Comillomagus, or Camiliomagus,

as the name is written in the Tabula, is unknown,

bnt must have been situated a short distance to the

W. of Broni.

7. Lastly, a branch of the Via Aemilia led from

Placentia to Ticinum (Paeia), whence it was car­

ried westwards to Augusta Taurinorum ( Turin) and

4*4
