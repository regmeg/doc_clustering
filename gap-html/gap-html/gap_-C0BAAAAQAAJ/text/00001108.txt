1024 SOZOPOMS. SPARTA

lie entered the territory of the Sotiates, the first of

the Aquitanian peoples whom he uttucked. The

Sotiates were the neighbours of the Elusates a

name represented by t lie town of JCause. A line

drawn from Auck (Ausei) on the Gers to Bazas in

tlie department of La Gironde, passes near Sos, a

town which is on the Getiie, and in the Gabaret.

In the middle ages it was called Solium. Ancient

remains have been found at Sos. Here we have an

instance of the preservation of ancient names in this

part of France, and tin-re are many oiher instances.

D'Anville in tfeteriniuine; the position of tlie Satiates

argues correctly that Crassus having passed through

the Santones. a people who hail submitted to Caesar

{ft. G. iii. 12) and would offer no resistance, entered

Aqtiitania by the north, and the Sotiates who were

onlv seven or eight leagues south of the Garonne

would be the first tribe on whom befell. Ho says

that he has evidence of a Roman road very direct

from Sos to Eause ; and he is convinced that this is

part of the road drscribed in the Jerusalem Itin. be­

tween Vasatae and Klusa. On this road the name Scit-

tium occurs in the Ttin., ami as the distance between

Scittiurn and Elu^a correspnnds very nearly to the

distance between Sos and tiause, he conjectures that

this word Scittiutn is written wrong, and that it

should be Solium.

The Sotiates, who were strong in cavalry, attacked

the Romans on their march, and a battle took place

in which they were defeated. Crassus then assaulted

their town, which made a stout resistance. He

brought up his vineae and towers to the walls, but

the Sotiates drove mines under them, for as they

had copper mines in their country they were very

skilful in burrowing in the ground. At last they

sent to Crassus to proj>ose terms of surrender (B. G.

iii. 21). While the people were giving up their arms

(.n one side of the town, Adcantuannus, who wa.; a

king or chief, attempted to sally out on another side

with his GOO " soldurii." The Romans met him

there, and after a hard fight Adcantuannus was

driven back into the town; but ho still obtained the

same easy terms as the rest.

These Soldurii were a body of men who attached

themselves to a chief with whom they enjoyed all

(he good things without working, so long as the

chief lived; but if any violence took off their leader

il was their duty to share the same fate or to die by

their own hand. This was an Iberian and also a

Gallic fashion. The tiling is easily understood.

A usurper or any desperate fellow seized on power

witli the help of others like himself; lived well, and

fed his friends; anil when his tyranny came to an

end, he and all his crew must kill themselves, if

they wished to escape the punishment which they

deserved. (Plut. Sertor. c. 14; Caesar, H. G. vi'i,

40; and the passage in Athenaeus.)

The MSS. of Caesar vary in the name of Adcan­

tuannus. Schneider writes it Adiatunus, and in

Athenaeus it is 'ASi^TOnoy. Schneider mentions a

medal of Pellerin, with REX AALETVfiNY'2 and

a lion's head on one side, and on the other SO-

TIOGA. Walekenaer (Geogr. <)'"<"• i. 284) may be

speaking of the same medal, when he describes one

which is said to have been found at, 'Jouluttjte, with

a head of Adictanus on one side and the w«>nl

Sotiagae on the other. He thinks it " very suspected;"

and it may be. [G. L.J
