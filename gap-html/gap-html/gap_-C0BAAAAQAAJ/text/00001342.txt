125S VAKIA. VANESIA.

VANESIA, a place in Gallia Aquitanica, fixed

by the Jerusalem Itin. between Elusa (Eause) and

Auscius, the capital of the Auaci, xii. from Elusa

and viii. from Auscius. The place is supposed by

D'Anville to be tlie passage of the Baise, a branch of

the Garonne which comes from the Pyrenees. [G.L.]

VANGIONES (Ova.yyiov*s). There were Van-

giones in the army of Ariovistus when Caesar de­

feated him. (B. G. i. 51.) Caesar means to say

that they were Germans, but he does not say whether

they were settled in Gallia. Pliny and Tacitus

(Ann, xii. 27, Germ. c. 2S) also describe the

Vangionea as Germans and settled on tlie left bank

of the Rhine, where they are placed by Ptolemy (ii.

9. § 17); but Ptolemy makes a mistake in placing the

Nemetes north of the Vanpiones, and making the

Vangiones the neighbours of the Tribocci, from whom

in fact the Vanpiones were separated by tiie Nemetes.

in the war of Civilis (Tacit. Hist. iv. 70), Tutor

strengthened tlie force of the Treviri by levies

raised among tlie Vangionea, Caracates [Caka-

CATEs], anil Tribocci. The territory of the Van-

giones seems to have been taken from that of the

Mediomatrici. Their chief town was Borbetomagus

( Worms). [Borbetomagus.] [G. L.]

VA'NNIA (Ohavvlc^ Ptol. iii. I. § 32),according

to Ptolemy a town of the Bechuui in Carnia or

Carniola (cf. Plin. iii. 19. B. 23). Variously iden-

tified with Venzone and Cividato. [T. II. D.]

VAITXCl'M. in Gallia Narbonensis, is not men­

tioned by any authority earlier than the Antonine

and Jerusalem Itins. In the Notitia of the Gallic

Provinces it is styled " Civitas Vapinccrisium.'" The

initial letter of the name has been changed to G, as

in many other instances in the French language, and

the modem name is Gap, which is the capital of

the department of Hautes-Alpes, and on a small

stream which flows into the Durance. [G. L.]

VARA, or VARAE, a town in Britannia Romans,

between Conovium and Deva. (Itin, Ant. p. 482.)

Variously identified with St. Asaph, Rudland, and

Bodvary. [T. H. D.]

VARADA (OiVpaSa, Ptol. ii. G. § 57), a town of

the Carpetani in Uispania Tarraconensis. [T.H.D.]

VARADETUM, in Gallia, is placed by the Table

on a road from Divona (Cohort) to Segodunum

(Rodez); and tlie distance from Divona is xv. D'An­

ville places Varadetum at Karattf, which is on the road

between Cukors and Rodez; but the distances do not

agree. Others fix the site at Puijourdet. [G. L.J

VARAE. [Vara.]

VARAGRI. [Veraori.]

VARAR (Oiidpap, Ptol. ii. G. § 5), an estuary on

the E. coast of Britannia Barbara, very probably the

present Frith of Cromarty. [T. H. D.]

VARCIAXI (OvapKtarol), a tribe in Upper Pan-

nonia. which is mentioned by bjth Pliny (iii. 28)

and Ptolemy (ii. 15. § 2), but of which nothing js

known, except that it probably occupied the western

portion of Slavonia. [L. S.]

VARCILENSES, the inhabitants of a town of

the Carpetani in Hispania Tarraconensis. (Inter,

in Morales, Ant. pp. 17, 26,28.) The modern

Yarciles still contains some ruins of the old

town. [T.H.D.]

VARDAEI (Ouap5a?oi, Ptol. ii. 17. § 8), an

Illy rial] tribe dwelling opposite to the island of

Pharos (cf. Plin. iii. 23. s. 2G). By Strabo they

are called Ardiaei ('ApSiaioi, vii. p. .315). In the

Epitome of Livy (Ivi.) they are said to have been

subdued by the consul Fulvius Flaccus. [T. H. D.]
