fact, two temples united in one. It has 18 co­

lumns in each side, and is ISO feet long by 80 in

width. The third temple, which is at some distance

from the other two, nearer to the X. pate of the

town, and is commonly known as the Temple of

Ceres or Vesta (though there is no reason for either

name), is much smaller that) the other two, being

only 108 feet in length by -18 in breadth: it presents

no remarkable architectural peculiarities, but is, as

well as the so-called Jlasilica, of much later date

than the greet temple. Mr. Wilkin*, indeed, would

assign them both to the Koman period: but it is dif­

ficult to reconcile this with the history of the city,

which never appear! to have been a place of much

importance under the Koman rule. (Swinburne's

Travels, yah ii. pp. 131 —138; WUkins's Magna

Graecia, pp. 55—(17.)

The oilier remains are of little importance. The

vestiges of an amphitheatre exist near the centre

of the city; aud not far from them are the

fallen ruins of a fourth temple, of small size and

clearly of Human date. Kxcavations have also laid

bare the foundations of many houses and other build­

ings, and the traces of a portico, which appear to

indicate the site of the ancient forum. The remains

of an aqueduct are also visible outside the walls;

and numerous tombs (some of which are said to be

of much interest) have been recently brought to

nght.

The small river which (as already noticed by

Strabo), by stagnating under the walls of Paestom,

rendered its situation so unhealthy, is now called the

Sulso: its ancient name is not mentioned. It forms

extensive deposits of a calcareous stone, resembling

the Roman travertin, which forms an excellent

building material, with which both the walls and

edifices of the city have been constructed. The ma­

laria, which caused the site to be wholly abandoned

during the middle ages, has already sensibly dimi­

nished, since the resort of travellers has again at­

tracted a small population to the spot, aud given

rise to some cultivation.

About five miles from Faestum, at the mouth

of the Silarui or Sete, stood, in ancient Umea, a cele­

brated temple of Juno, which, according to the tra­

dition adopted both by Strabo ami Pliny, was founded

by the Argonauts under Jason (Strab. vi. p. 252;

Plin. iii. 5. s. 10). It is protublc that the raifca

of the Argive Hera, or Juno, was brought hiiixrlif
