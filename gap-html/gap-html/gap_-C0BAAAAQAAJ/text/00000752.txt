described by Pausanias as tin; farthest of the Eleu-

thero-Laconian places on this part of the coast, and

as distant 200 stadia by sea from Cyphanta. (Pans,

iii. 24. § 3.) Scvlax (i c.) speaks of it as a city

and a harbour. The. name of the town was derived

by the inhabitants from the noise of the waves

(iipd(€iv). H was burnt by the Athenians in the

second year of the Peloponnesian W ar, n. c. 430.

(Time. ii. 50; Aristoph. I'ae. 242.) Also in B.C.

414 the Athenians, in conjunction with the Argivea,

ravaged tiie coast near I'rasiae. ( Time. vi. 105.)

Ju the Macedonian period Prasiae, with other La-

conian towns on this coast, passed into the hands of

the Arrives (Polvb. iv. 36); whence St mho calls it

one of the Arrive towns (viii. p. 3G8), though in

another passage he says that it belonged at an

earlier ]>eriod to the Lacedaemonians (viii. p. 374).

It was restored to Eaconia by Augustus, who made

it one of the K knit hero-Lucnui an towns. (Paus. iii.

21. § 7, iii. 24. § 3.) Among the curiosities of

I'rasiae Pausanias mentions a cave where Ino nursed

]>ionysus; a temple of Asclep'ms and another of

Achilles, and a small promontory u]*m which stood

four bra/.en figures not more than a foot in height.

(Pans. iii. 24. i-i? 4, 5.) Leake places Prasiae at

.SV. Andrtir in the Thyreatis; but it more probably

stood at Tyro, which is tlie site assigned to it by

lijblayc, Ross, and Cnrtius. (Leake, Mvrea, vol, ii.

PRASCM PROMOXTCRirM (IlpdW atcpu-

to which the ancient geographers gave the appella­

tion of Barbariea. The position of Prasum is un­

known; for it i>> impossible to identify Prasum, the

(Jreen Promontory, with Tape Dtbjndo, i.e. Cape

Slender, which, as the name implies, is a mere line

njMin the water. Neither is it certain that Prasum,

although a lofty n» k, was a j«Ttion of the main-

laud at all. inasmuch as the coast of /Zhigcbar, where

Piasum is probably to be found, is distinguished

alike for the verdure of its projections and the

blight green islands that stretch along and beyond

them. Moreover, Agathemerus (p. 57) and Mar-

riniuis Ileracleota ("/*. Hudson, (itng. Min. \. p. 12)
