NYMPHAEUS (Mn/n), a small river of Latinm,

mentioned only by Pliny (iii. 5. s. 9), who describes

it as hVwing into the sea between Astura and Circeii.

There ran be no doubt that the stream meant is the

one still called the Ninfa, though this does nut now

flow into the sea at all, but within a few miles of its

source (which is at the foot of the Volseian moun­

tains, immediately below the site of Norba, forming

a po.»l or small lake of beautifully clear water) stag­

nates, and loses itself in the Pontine Marshes. A

town called Sin fa arose, in the middle aces, close to'

its source, but this is now in ruins. We have no

account of any ancient town on the site. [E.H.B.]

bradus, and Hydrelus, who emigrated from Sputa,

and founded three towns on the north of the M*e-

ander; but in the course of time Nysa abs->rU i tl a

Athymbrus as their founder. (Steph. B. t. r.
