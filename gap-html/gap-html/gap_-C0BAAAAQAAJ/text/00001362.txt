1278 VEREASUECA. VERODUXEXSES.

OvtpKtWoi, Strab. v. p. 218; Bepure'AAai, Plat.

Mar. 25: Vercelli), the chief city of the Libici. in

Gallia Cisalpina. It lay on the W. bank of the Ses-

sites (Sesta); but perhaps the ancient town should

be sought at Borgo Vercelli, about 2 miles from the

modern city. In the time of Strabo it was an un-

fortified village {I. &), but subsequently became a

strong ami not unimportant Roman municipium.

(Tac, Hist. i. 70 ; cf. De ctar. Orator. 8 ; also

Orell. Inscr. 3044, 3945.) Here the highroad

from Ticinum to Augusta Praetoria was crossed by

a road running westwards from Mediolanum. (Itin.

Ant. pp. 282, 344, 347, 350.) At the beginning of

the 5th century it was rapidly falling to decay.

(Hieron. Epist 17.) There were some cold mines

at a place called Ictimuli, or Vicus Ictimuiorum, in

the district of Vercellae (Strab. I. c.\ Plin. xxxiii.

4. s. 21), which must have been of considerable im­

portance, as tlie hist cited authority mentions a law

forbidding that more than 5000 men should be em­

ployed in them. The true position of these mines

has, however, been the subject of some dispute. The

question is fully discussed by Durandi in his treatise

Dell" antica Condizione del Ytrcellese. The city

was distinguished for its worship of A]«>llo, whence

it is called Apollineae Vercellae by Martial (x. 12.

1); and there was in its vicinity a grove, and per­

haps a temple sacred to that deity (Sfat. Silr. i. 4.

59), which is prubably to be sought at a small place

called Polhne, at the foot of the Alps. (Cf. Cic.

Fam. xi. 19; Plin. iii. 17. s. 21; Bellini, Antichita

di Vercelli.) [T. K D.]

VEREASUECA, a harbour belonging to the town

of Ar^cnoniescum, in the territory of the Cantabri,

in Hispania Tarraconensis. (Plin. iv. 20. s. 34.)

Probably Fmrto dc S. Martin. (Cf. Florez, Esp.

Sagr. x'xiv. p. 44.) [T. H. D.]

VERELA. [Vama.]

VERETUM (OvtpvTou, Strab., Ptol.: Eth. Vere-

tinus: Sta Maria di Vtrtto), a town of Calabria,

in the district or territory of the Sallentines, and

within a few miles of the lapygian promontory.

Strabo tells us that it was formerly called Baris,

and describes it as if it were a seaport town; but

both Pliny and Ptolemy rank it among the inland

towns of the Sallentines; and there seems no doubt

that its site is marked by the old church of Sta

Maria di l'erefo,the name of winch is found on old

maps, between the villages of Salve and Jioggiano,

about fj miles from the Capo di Leuca, and 10 from

Ugento, the correct distance given in the Tabula

from Uxentum to Veretum. (Strab. vi. p. 281;

Plin. iii. 11. s. 1G; Ptol. iii. ]. § 76; Tab. Petit.;

Galateo, de Sit. Iapyg. p. 99; Holsten. ad Clover.

p. 283; Romanelli, vol. ii. p. 35.) The " ager Vc-

retinus" is mentioned also in the Liber Coloniarum

(p. 202) anions* the " civitates Calabriae," and doubt­

less comprised tlie whole district as far as the

lapvgian promontorv. [E. H. !>.]

VERGAE. [Brutth.]

VERGELLUS, a rivulet or torrent, which crossed

the tield of battle of Cannae. It is not indeed men­

tioned by either Livy or Polybius in their circum­

stantial accounts of the battle, but it is noticed by

both I- lorus and Valerius Maxim us in connection with

a story that seems to have been current among the

Romans, that its course was choked up by the dead

bodies of the slain, to such an extent that the Car­

thaginian troops crossed over them as a bridge.

(I'lor. ii. f>. § IS; Vul. .Max. ix. 2, Ext. § 2.) The

same incident is alluded to by other writers, but

without mentioning the name of the
