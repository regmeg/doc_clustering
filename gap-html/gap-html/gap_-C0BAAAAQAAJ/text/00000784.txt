RHAETIA ('PaiTia). The name of this country,

as well as of its inhabitants, appears in ancient in­

scriptions invariably without the A, as Raetia and

Raeti, while tlie MSS. of Latin authors commonly

have the forms Rhaetia and Khaeti,—a circumstance

which £oe* far to show that the more correct spelling

without the Khaetia was essentially an Alpine

country, bordering in the north on Vindelicia, in the

weat on tlie territory inhabited by tlie Helvetii, in

the south on tlie chain of tlie Alps from Mons

Adula to Mons Ocra, which separated Rhaetia from

Italy, and in the east on Noricum and Veuetia;

hence it comprised the modern Orisons, the Tyrol,

and some of the northern parts of Lombardy. This

country and its inhabitants did not attract much

attention in ancient times until the reign of Au­

gustus, who determined to reduce the Alpine tribes

which had until then maintained their independence

in the mountains. After a struggle of many years

Khaetia and several adjoining districts were con­

quered by lJrusus and Tiberius, b. c. 15. Rhaetia,

within the boundaries above described, seems then to

have been constituted as a distinct province (Suet.

Aug. 21; Veil. Pat. ii. 39; Li v. Epit. 136; Aurel.

Vict. Epit. 1). Vindelicia, in the north of Rhaetia,

must at that time likewise have been a separate

province; but towards the end of the first century

A. i». the two provinces appear united as one, under

the name of Rhaetia, which accordingly, in this

latter sense, extended in the north as far as the

Danube and the Limes. At a still later period, in

or shortly before the reign of Constantine, the two

provinces were again divided, and ancient Khaetia

received the name Khaetia Prima, its-capital being

called Curia Uhaetoruni (Cfntr); while Vindelicia

was called Rhaetia Secunda. The exact boundary line

between the two is not accurately defined by the an­

cients, but it is highly probable that the Alpine chain

extending from the Lake, of Constance to the river

Inn was the natural line ot demarcation; it should,

however, be observed that Ptolemy (ii. 12) includes

under the name of Khaetia all the country west of

the river Licus as far as the sources of the Danubius

and Ubeuus, while he applies the name of Vindelicia

to the territory between the Licus and Genus.

Ancient Rhaetia or Khaetia Proper was throughout

an Alpine country, being traversed by the Alpes

Rhaeticae and Mons Adula. It contained tlie sources

of nearly all the Alpine rivers watering the north of

Italy, such as the Addua, Sari us, Olbius, Cleusis,

Mincius, and others; but the chief rivers of Khaetia

itself were the Athesis with its tributary the Isargus

(or Ilargus), and the Aenus or Oenus. The mag­

nificent valleys formed by these rivers were fertile

and well adapted to agricultural pursuits; but the

inhabitants depended mainly upon their flocks (Strab.

vii. p. 316). The chief produce of the valleys was

wine, which was not at all interior to that grown in

Italy; so that Augustus was particularly partial to

it (Strab. iv. p. 206; I'lin. xiv. 3, 5. 8;Virg. Gcorg. ii.

516; Colum.iii. 2 ; Martial, xiv. 100; Suet. Aug. 77).

Besides this Khaetia produced abundance cf m

honey, pitch, and cheese, in which cvcsiC-riiiie ao

merce was carried on.

The ancient inhabitants of Rhaetia have b

times attracted mure than ordinary attenutB torn

their supposed connection with the ancient Ktnscx'j

They are first mentioned by Polybius (xxzir. 19

comp. Strab. iv. p. 204. vii. pp. 292. 313). AbnH

ing to tradition the Rhaetian* were Etruscan wa

had originally inhabited the plains of Leatirf^

but were compelled by the invading Gaai* w oa

their country and take refuge in the Aip*. *tm4

they were cut off from their kinsmen, rtsuisa

in Italy and finally established themselves m Lirsn

(Justin, xx. 5; Plin. iii. 24; Steph. B. #. r. 'Pa--*.

This tradition derives some support fnan tae hi

recorded by Dionysius of Hahcuxuassus (L 2-1J til

the Etruscans in Etruria called them»rlve. B*<fl

which is believed to be only another form if

name Khaeti. A decision of this question is ii» mi

difficult because at the time when the Rttsmas rj

quered Rhaetia the bulk of its inbabitaLt*

Celts, which in the course of a few ecu tori** tecfl

entirely Romanised. But. assuming that Xht l&a1

were a branch of the Etruscan nation, it t> ac< ^1

likely that on the invasion of Italy by lie 0*

they should have gone back to the Alps arrua »L4

they had come into Italy: it seems tuata na

probable to suppose that the Etruscans id tie Al

were a remnant of the nation left behiad t&?"»i

Etruscans lias led modern inquirers to search

they reasonably assumed that, although tir pi

still exist some traces of its original inbau*uasii
