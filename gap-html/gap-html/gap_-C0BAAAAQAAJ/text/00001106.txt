1022 SORA. SONTIUS,

SO'NTITTS (Tsonzo), one of the most considerable

of the rivers of Venetia, which has its sources in the

Alps, at the foot of the lofty Mt. Terglou^ and has

from thence :i course of above 75 miles to the sea,

which it enters at the inmost bight of the Adriatic,

between Aquileia and the Timavus. It receives at

the present day the waters of the Natisone and

Torre, the ancient Natiso and Turris, both of which

in ancient times pursued independent courses to the

.sea under the walls of Aquileia, and from the, E.

tlmse of the Wippach or Vipao, called by the ancients

the Fluvius Frioidus, Though so important a

stream, the name of the Sontius is not mentioned by

any of the geographers; but it is found in the Tabula,

which places a station nailed Ponte Sonti (Ad Pontem

Son lit) 14 miles from Aquileia on the highroad to

Aemona (LaybacK). This bridge, which lay on the

main entrance into Italy on this side, was a military

point of considerable importance. It checked for a

time the march of the emperor Maximin when

advancing upon Aquileia, in a. i>. 238 (Herodian,

viii. 4; Capit. Maximin. 22); and at a later period

it was here that Odoaccr took up his position to

oppose the advance of Theodosius, l>y whom he was,

liowever, defeated in a decisive battle, A. J>. 489

(Cassiod. Citron, p. 472; Id. Var. i. 18; Jornand.

Gtt. 57). The Sontius is correctly described by

Herodian, though he does not mention its name, as a

large and formidable stream, especially in spring and

summer, when it is fed by the melting of the Alpine

snows. [E.H.B.]

SONUS (2vros, Arrian, Tnd. c. 4; Pirn. vi. 18.

8. 22), a principal affluent of the Ganges, which

flows in a NE. direction to it from the Vmdhya

Mountains. lis modern name is Sonne. There is

no doubt that it has been contracted from the San­

scrit Suvarna, golden. The Soaa (2^ai) of Ptolemy

(vii. 1. § 30) is certainly the same river. [V.]

SOPHE'NE (2^0tjW?, Strab. et alii; Sw^onjf^

I)ion Cass, xxxvi. 3b'; Procop. tie Aedif. iii. 2, B.

J'tW. i. 21: Etk. ~2.u3<pi)v6s), a district of Armenia,

lying between Antitaurus and Mount Masius, sepa­

rated by the Euphrates from Melitene in Armenia

Minor, and by Antitaurus from Mesopotamia. Its

capital was Carcatbiocerta. (Strab. xi. pp. 521,

522, 527.) It formed at one time, with the neigh­

bouring districts, a separate west Armenian kingdom,

governed by the Sophenian Artanes, but was annexed

to the east Armenian kingdom by Tigranes. So-

pliene was taken away from Tigranes by Pompey.

(Strab. xi. p. 532; Dion Cass, xxxvi. 2lj; Plut.

Lucnll. 24, Pomp, 33.) Nero gave Sophene as a

separate kingdom to Soli senilis. (Tac. Ann. xiii. 7.)

SOP I A'N A E, a town in the central par t of

Lower Pannonia, on the road from Mursa to Sab aria

(It Ant. pp. 231, 232, 264, 207), was according

to Am mi anus Marcellinus (xxviii. 1) the birthplace

of the emperor Maximums. Its site is occupied by

the modern Funjkireken. [L. S.]

S0RA(2£pct: Etk. Soranus: Sora), a city of La-

tium, situated in the valley of the Liris, on the right

hank of that river, about 6 miles to the N. of Ar-

pinuin. Though included in Latium in the more

extended sense of that term, as it was understood

under the Roman Empire, Sora was originally a

Volscian city (Liv. x. 1), and Apparently the most

northerly possessed by that people. It was wrested

from them by the Romans in B.C. 345, being sur­

prised by a sudden attack by the consuls Fabins

Dorso and Ser. Sulpicius. (Liv. vii. 28.) It was

subsequently occupied by the Romans with a colony:
