COIS OF ODESSUS.

ODOMANTI {'OUfiavroi, Herod, vii. 112;

Thuc. ii. 101, v. 6; Steph. B. ». t\; Odomantes,

Plin. iv. 18), a Paeonian tribe, who occupied the

district, called after them, Odomastice ('O5o,ua.v-

riich, Ptol. iii. 13. § 31; Liv. xliv. 4; 'OBopavrls,

Steph. B.) This tribe were settled upon the whole

of the great mountain Orbelus, extending along the

NE. of the lower Strymonic plain, from about Mele-

niko and Demirissdr to Zildina inclusive, where

they bordered on Pangaeus, the gold and silver

mines of which they wurked with the Pieres and

Satrae. (Herod. L c.) Secure in their inacces­

sible position, they defied Megabazns. (Herod, v.

16.) The NW. portion of their territory lay to the

right of Sitalces as he crossed Mt. Cercine; and

their general situation agrees with the description of

Thueydides (ii. 101), according to whom they dwelt

beyond the Strymon to the N., that is to say, to the

N. of the Lower Strymon, where, alone, the river

takes such a course to the E. as to justify the expres­

sion. Cleon invited Polles, their chieftain, to join

him with as many Thxacian mercenaries as could be

levied. (Thuc. v. 6; Aristoph. Acharn. 156, 164;

Suid. v. dLvort&plaKfV; Leake, Northern Greece,

vol. iii pp. 210, 306, 465.) [E. B. J.]

ODOMANTIS. [Sofhkxr.]

O'BKYSAE ( OSptvcTo.), a people seated on both

banks of the Artiscus, a river of Thrace, which

discharges itself into the Hebrus. (Herod, iv. 92.)

Their territory, however, must undoubtedly have

extended considerably to the \V. of the Artiscus;

since Pliny (iv. 18) informs us that the Hebrus

had its source in their country; a fact that is cor­

roborated by Ammianus Marccllinus (xxvii. 4, 10).

They appear to have belonged to that northern

swarm of barbarians which invaded Thrace after

the Trojan War; and their names are often found

interwoven in the ancient myths. Thus the Thra-

cian singer Thamyris is said to have been an

Odrysian (Paus. iv. 33. § 4); and Orpheus is

represented as their king. (Conon, ap. rho(.

p. 140.)
