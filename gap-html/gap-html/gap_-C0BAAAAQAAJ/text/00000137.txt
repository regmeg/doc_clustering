LAMPSUS. LANGOBARDI. 119

Enapon to seize the citadel, and thereby to make him­

self tyrant, seems to belong to the same period.

(Athen. xi. p. 508.) After the battle of Mycale, in

b. c. 479, T ■nipwtmi joined Athena, but revolted

after the failure of the great Athenian expedition to

Sicily; being, however, unfortified, it was easily re­

conquered by a fleet under Strombichidea. (Thuc.

riii. 62.) After the time of Alexander the Great,

the Lampsaceni had to defend their city against the

attacks of Antiocbus of Syria; they voted a crown

o( gold to the Romans, and were received by them

a$ allies. (Liv. xxxiii. 38, xxxv. 42, xliii. 6; Polyb.

xxi. 10.) In the time of Strabo, Lampsacns was

still a flourishing city. It was the birthplace of

many distinguished authors and philosophers, sucli

B Chimn the historian, Anaximenes the orator, and

Metrodorus the disciple of Epicurus, who himself

resided there for many years, and reckoned some of

its citizens among his intimate friends. (Strab. /. c.;

Ding. Laert. x. 11.) Lampsacus possessed a fine

stitue by Lysippus, representing a prostrate lion,

bat it was removed by Agrippa to Home to adorn

the Campos Martius. (Strab. /. c.) Lampsacus, as

it well known, was the chief seat of the obscene

worship of Priapos, who was believed to have been

born there of Aphrodite. (Athen. i. p. 30; Paus.

ix. 31. § 2; Apollon. Rhod. i. 983; Ov. Fast, vi.

345; Virg. Gtorg. iv. 110.) From this circum-

-tar.ce the whole district was believed to have de­  
rived the name of Abarnis or Aparnis (airapvtia-$ai)t

■-■ aose Aphrodite denied that she had given birth

to him. (Theophr. Hist Plant i. 6, 13.) The an­

cient name of the district had been Bebrycia, pro­

bably from the Thracian Bebryces, who had settled

there. (Comp. Hecat. Fragm, 207; Charon, Fragm.

115,119; Xenoph. Anal. vii. 8. § 1; Polyb. v. 77;

Pint iv. 18, v. 40; Ptol v. 2. § 2; Steph. B. *. v.)

Th« name of Lammki is still attached to a small

town, near which Lampsacns probably stood, as

l.aruati itself contains no remains of antiquity.

There are gold and silver staters of Lampsacns in

ftifferent collections; the imperial coins have been

triced from Augustus to Gallienus. (Sestini, Mon.

LAMPTRA. [Attica, p. 331, a.]

LAMUS (Actios), a village of Cilicia, at the

Booth of the river Lamus, from which the whole

^strict derived the name of Lamotis. The river

a mentioned by Stephanas B. (from Alexander

Po^htftor), and both the river and the village by

Strabo (xiv. p. 671) and Ptolemy (v. 8. §§4,6).

The river, which is otherwise of no importance,

twn*d the boundary between Cilicia Aspera and

Cilicia Propria, and still bears the name of Lamas or

£«iaa>. About the village of Lamus no particulars

*re known. (Comp. Nonnus, Dionys. xxiv. 50;

Ptol. I. c.) or Lanciknses (Plin. iii. 3. s. 4), a tribe

of the Astures, in Hispania Tarraconensis. It was

strongly fortified, and was the most important city

of that region, even more so than Leoio VII. Ge-

mina, at least before the settlement of the latter by

the Romans, by whom Lancia was destroyed, though

it was again restored. It lay on the high road from

Caesaraugusta to Legio VII. (Leon), only 9 M. P.

from the latter, where its name is still to be traced

in that of Sollanco or Si,Ilancia. (Floral, Esp. S.

LANGOBAKDI, LONGOBARDI (Aaryo&v5o.,

Ao77oSap5o(, also AayyoSdpSai and Aoyyo6,dp&'ai),

a tribe of Germans wliom we first meet with in the

plain, south of the lower Elbe, and who belonged to

the Suevi (Strab. vii. p. 290, where Kramer reads

Aayi<66ap$oi; Ptol. ii. 11. §§9, 17). According to

Paulus Diaconus, himself a Langobard, or Lombard

(Hist Longob. i. 3,8; comp. Isidor. Orig. ix. 2;

Elgin. M. s. v. ffvuov), the tribe derived its name

from the long beards, by which they distinguished

themselves from the other Germans, who generally

shaved their beards. But it seems to be more pro­

bable that they derived the name from the country

they inhabited on the banks of the Elbe, where

Bbrde (or Bord) still signifies "a fertile plain by the

side of a river;" and a district near Magdtburg ia

still called the lange Bvrde (Wilhelm, Germanieti,

p. 286). According to this, Langobardi would sig ■

nify "inhabitants of the long bord of the river."

The district in which we first meet with them, i»

the left bank of the Elbe, from the point where the

Sala empties itself into it, to the frontiers of the

Chanci Minores, so that they were bounded in the

north by the Elbe, in the east by the Semnones, in

the south by the Cherusci, and in the west by the

Fosi and Angrivarii. Traces of the name of the

Langobardi still occur in that country in such names

as Bardengau, Bardeaik. The earliest writer who

mentions the Langobardi as inhabiting those parts,

is Velleius Patcrculus (ii. 106). But not* ithstanding

the unanimous testimony of the ancients that they

were a branch of the Suevi, their own historian

(Paul. Diac. I c.; comp. Euseb. Chron. ad an. 380)

states that the Langobardi originally did not inhabit

any part of Germany, but had migrated south from

Scandinavia, where they had borne the name of

Vinili. and that they assumed the name Langobardi

after their arrival in Germany. It is impossible to

say what value is to be attributed to this statement,

which has found as many advocates as it has had

opponents. From Strabo (/. c.) it is clear that they

occupied the northern bank of the Elbe, and it is

possible that they were among those Germans whom

Tiberius, in the reign of Augustus drove across the

Elbe (Suet. Aug. 21). In their new country they

were soon reduced to submission bv Maroboduus, but
