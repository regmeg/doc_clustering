or Fabaris (Far/a).

The Tiber is unquestionably, in n merely geo­

graphical point of view, the most important river of

Central Italy, but its great celebrity is derived from

its flowing under tlie walls of Pome, or rather through

the heart of the city, after this had attained to its

full extension. The detailed account of the river in

this part of its course must be sought in the article

Roma: we need here only mention that after flow­

ing under the Milvian Bridge [Pons Milvius or

Mulvius] the river makes a considerable bend to

the W. ao as to approach the foot of the Vatican

hills, and leave, on the other side, between its left

bank and the nearest ridge of hills, a broad tract of

plain, early known as the Campus Martius, the

whole of which was eventually included within the

imperial city. A short distance lower down, but

still within the walls of the city, its stream was di­

vided into two by an island known as the Txsi'LA

TiitLiiiNA, and reported by tradition to have been

formed by alluvial accumulations within the period

of Roman history. It is remarkable that this is the

only island of any consideration in the whole course

of the river, with the exception of that failed the

Insula Sacra, at its mouth, formed by the two

arms of the river, and which is undoubtedly of late

growth, and in great part of artificial formation.

The Tiber was at all times, like most rivers which

are supplied principally by mountain streams, a

turbid, rapid, and irregular river, that must always

have presented considerable difficulties to navigation.

The yellow and muddy hue of its turbid waters is re­

peatedly alluded to by the Roman poets (" flavum Ti-

berim," Hor. CarmA. 2.13; " suo cum gurgite ilavo,"

Virg. Aen. ix. 816; &c), and the truth of Virgil's

description," Vorticibus rapid is et multa flavus arena,"

{Aen. vii. 31), must be familiar to every one who has

visited Rome. In the upper part of its course, as

we learn from Pliny, the river was with difficulty

navigable, even for small boats ; nor did its first

tributaries, the Tinia and Clanis contribute much to

its facilities in this respect, though their waters were

artificially dammed up, and let off from time to time

in order to augment the main stream. (Plin. iii. 5,

s. 9.) But from the point of its junction with the

Nar, the Tiber became navigable for larger vessels,

and even from an early ]>eriod extensive supplies of

various kinds were brought down the river to

Rome. (Liv. ii. 34, v. 54; Cie. de Rep. ii. 5;

ficc) In the more flourishing period of the city

the navigation of the Tiber was of course enor­

mously increased; and vast supplies of timber,

stone, and other materials for building, as well as

corn and provisions, were continually introduced by

means of the river and its tributaries. (Strab. v.

p. 235.) Corn was brought down the Tiber even

from the neighbourhood of Tifernmn, when the upper

part of the stream was navigable. (Plin. Ep. v. 6.)

it seems also to have been used as an ordinary mode

of travelling, as we are told that in A. d. 20, Piso,

the murderer of Germanicus, proceeded from Narnia

to Rome by descending the Nar and the Tiber. (Tac.

Amu iii. 9.) At the pren'nt day the river is navi­

gated by boats of large size as far as the confluence

of the Nera, and small steamers ascend as far as

Borghetto, n few miles from Otricoli.

But it, was from Rome itself to the sea. a distance

of 27 miles by the river (Strab. v. p. 232), that the

navigation of the Tiber was the most important,

Pliny speaks of it as in this part of its course na­

vigable for the largest vessels (" (mimftrt tarn-
