PEDASUS. [Metiiose.]

PEDIAEUS (n«5-aTuy). the largest river of Cy- 1

prus, rising from the extern side of Olympus, and

flowing near Salami.-, into the sea. (Ptol. v. 14. § 3;

Engcl, Kypros, ?ol. i. p. ."(7.)

PED1EIS (ntoi<7i)- inhabitants of one of

ttie Phocian towns destroyed by Xerxes. (Herod,

viii. 33.) From the order in which it stands in tin1

enumeration of Herodotus, it appears to have stood

near the Cephissus, in some part of the plain be­

tween Tithorea anil Elateia, and is perhaps re­

presented by the ruins at Paled Flea. (Leake,

Northern Greece, vol. ii. p. 89.)

I'KUNKLISSI'.S (n*5»'7?Aw<Td's). a town in the

interior of Pibidia, near the Eurymedon, above A&pen-

du& (Strab. xii. p. ")70;xiv. p. 6G7; Steph. II. s. v.;

Ptol. v. 5. § 8.) Hicroeles (p. 681), giving a

greater extension to Pamphylia, assigns the town to

this province. Tin.* town formed a small state by

itself, hut was always involved in war with the

neighbouring Selge. (Polyb. v. 72, &e.) It. is

also mentioned in the ecclesiastical annals and on

coins. (Sestini, p. 90.) Fellows {Asia Min*»\

p. 190, &e.) is inclined to identify the extensive

ruitis near the village of Bolcascooe with tlie an­

cient Pednelissus; these ruins, liowcver, according

to his description, bear scarcely any trace of Greek

origin, hut belong to the Roman period. [L. S.]

PEDO'NIA (nijoWfo), a town on the coast of

Marmarica, before which lay an island of the same

name. (Ptol, iv. 5. 4}$ 32, 75.) This island is also

mentioned by Strabo, but in some editions under the

name of Sidonia (xvii. p. 799). We may, however,

conclude from Ptoh-niv that lYdi>nia is tiie direct

reading. (See Groskurd's Strabo, vol iii. p. 357.)

I'EIH'M (n<5a, Steph. I*.: Eth. IleoWy, Pe-

danus: OalUcano), an ancient city of Latimn, which

npjKv:rs to have been at one period of considerable

importance. It is mentioned by Dionysus as one of

the cities which composed the league against Koine

in it. c. 493; and there is n<> doubt that it was, in

fact, one of the thirty cities of the Latin League.

(I)imiy.s. v. 01; Niebuhr, vol. ii. p. 17.) It is next

men tinned among the cities which are said to have

been taken by Coriolanus in tin* campaign of b. r.

488, where its name is associated with those of

Lahicum and Cnrbio. (Liv. ii. 39; Dionys. viii. 19;

PIut. Coriol. 28.) Dionysius terms it at this time

a small city (lb. 20); and it is remarkable that its

name does not again <H'cur during the warn of the

Itomans with the Aequians, notwithstanding its

proximity to the frontier of the two nations. It is

next mentioned in d. c. 358, when the Gauls, who

had invaded Latium, encamped in its neighbour-

hood, where they sustained a severe defeat from the

dictator C. Sulpiciua. (Liv. vil. 12.) During the

last great struggle of the Latins with Rome, the

Pedani bear a more considerable part. Their name,

indeed, is not mentioned at the first outbreak of the

w ar, though there can he no doubt of their having

taken part in it: but, in n. c. 339, Pedum became

for a time the centre of hostilities, being besieged by

the Roman consul Aemihus, and defended by the

allied forces assembled from Tibur, Praeueste, Veli-

trae, Lanuvium, and Antium. Aemilius on this

occasion abandoned the enterprise; but the next year

Camilitis again advanced to Pedum, and. the forces

of the Latins being now divided, the Tihurtines and

Praeuee tines alone arrived fur its protection. They

were defeated in a great battle by Camillas, md tbf

city of Pedum taken by assault immeiiUtely ni'r-

wards. (Liv. viii. 12,13; Fait. CapiL) In

general pacification that followed tiie l-'edani ottiari

the Roman franchise, but on the same lenr^s is iia

Lanuviaus, that is to say, without the rifht of tk

suffrage. (lb. 14.) From this time n»>t (<n!y 4m
