JUSTIKIA'XA. [Carthago : Hadrumetum.]

JCSTINIA'XA PRIMA. [Scupi.]

JCSTINIANO'POLIS. I. A city in Epeirus,

formerly called Hadrianopolis. [Hadrianopolis.]

2. The later name of Hadrumetum iu Africa.

[HaDKUMETIM.]

JUTHUNGI (loofloiryvoi), a German tribe

dwelling on the banks of the Danube. They are

described by some ancient writers as a part of the

Aleinamii (Amm. Marc. xvii. 6); but they belonged

mure probably to the Gothic race : even their name

seems to be only another form for Gothi or Gothones.

(Ambros. EpisL 20.) Dexippus, from whom we

learn most about their history, calls them a Scythian

tribe, which, however, clearly means that they were

Guths.

In the reign of the emperor Aurelian the Juthungi

invaded Italy, and, being defeated, they sued for

pace, bat were obliged to return without having

effected their purpose: afterwards they made prepa­

rations lor another invasion. (Dexip. pp. 11, 12, 18,

19, 21, ed. Niebuhr and Bekker.) In these wars,

however, they never appeared alone, but always in

conjunction with others, either Alemannians, Suevi,

«r Goths. (See Eisenschmidt, de Origine Ostro-

ystforws et Yisigothontm, p. 26; Latham, Tacit.

JUTTAH (It«lk, LXX.), a town of Judah {Josh.

it. 55), appropriated to the priests; according to

KiL-ebius {OnomasL s. v. 'IcttoV) it was 18 M. P.

from Eleutheropolis. Reland {Palaesl. p. 870)

supposes this to have been the residence of Zacharias

and Elizabeth, and the birthplace of John the

Baptiat,—the wdAu 'IouSa of Luke, i. 39, being so

written, by a corruption or from a softer pronun­

ciation, instead of woAu 'looro. The modem Yiitta,

on the site of the old town, in which there are said

In be indications of old remains, preserves the ancient

name. (Robinson. Bib. lies, vol. ii. pp. 190, 195,

628; Kitter, Erdhmde, vol. xv. pt. i. pp. 638, 641;

Wirier, i. r.) [E. B.J.]

JUVAVUM, JTJVA'VTA, a town in the interior

of X'jricum, on the left bank of the river Ivarus.

It is the modern city of Salzburg, situated in

an extensive and fertile valley, on the slope of a range

rf a high mountain. It is chiefly known from in-

Kriptiona : one of which (Orelii, no. 496) describes

the place as a colony planted by the emperor Hadrian;

but its genuineness is disputed. (Orelii, Inscript.

'•4. i. p. 138.) Juvavium was the head-quarters of

the filth cohort of the first legion {Nolit. Imper.)

and the residence of the governor of the province.

At an earlier period it seems to have been the resi­

dence of the native kings of Noricum. In the second

half of the fifth century it was destroyed by the

Hemli; but was restored as early as the seventh

century, and still contains many beautiful remains

rf antiquity, especially mosaics. (Comp. Orelii, /«-

Tip!, noi. 496, 497; /tin. Ant. p. 235, where it

brar* the erroneous name of Jovavis; Eugipp. Yit.

KADESH(Ko8T)r,I.XX),orKADESH-BARNEA,

> site on the SE. of Palestine, with a fountain, Ex-

mishpat {Gen. xiv. 7, xvi. 14), where the Israelites

encamped with the intention of entering the Pro­

mised Land {Num. xxxii. 8), and the point from

which the spies were sent. {Num. xiii. xiv. 40—45,

xxi. 1—3; Dent. i. 41—44; comp. Judg. i. 17.)

The supposition that the Kadesh-Barnea, to which

the Israelites first came, is different from the

Kadesh-Meribah, which formed their later encamp­

ment, where the wants of the people were mira­

culously supplied from the smitten rock {Num. xx.

14), reconciles some difficulties. On the hypothesis

that there were two places of this name, the first

Kadesh and its localities agrees very well with the

spring of 'A in Kiides or Kudes, lying to the E. of

the highest part of Bjebel Haiti, towards its N.

extremity, about 12 miles from Moilahhi Hadjar.

(Beer-lahai-roi, Gen. xvi. 14), and something like due

S. from Khalasa (Chezil, Josh. xv. 30), which has

been identified by Mr. Rowlands (Williams, Holy

City, voL i. App. pp. 466—468) with the rock

struck by Moses.

The second Kadesh, to which the Israelites came

with a view of passing through the land of Edom,

coincides better with the more easterly position of

'Ain-el-Weibeh which Dr. Robinson {Bib. Res.

vol. ii. pp. 582, 610, 622) has assigned to it

(comp. Kitto. Scripture Lands, p. 82). Bitter

{Erdhmde, vol. xiv. pp. 1077—1089), who refers

to the latest discoveries in this district, does not

determine whether one Kadesh would sufficiently

answer all the conditions required. [E. B. J.]

KADMONITES {KiSuuvaioi, LXX.), a nation of

Canaan at the time that Abraham sojourned in the

land (t7en. xv. 19). The name Beni-Kedem, "chil­

dren of the East" {Judg. vi. 3; comp. Isa. xi. 14),

was probably not distinctive of, but collectively ap­

plied to various peoples, like the Saracens in the

middle ages, and the Beduins in later times. (Ritter,

Erdkunde, vol. xv. pt. i. p. 138.) [E. B. J.]

KAMOX {Kautiy, LXX.), a town in Gilead, be­

longing to the tribe of Manasseh, where Jair died.

{Judges, x. 5; comp. Joseph. Antiq. v. 7. § 6.) The

Kamona {Kafiicvd) of Eusebius, which lay 6 M. P.

to the N. of Legio {Onomast. s. ».), must have been

another place of the same name; but the city which

Polybius (v. 70) calls Camus (Ka/u>0i), and which

was taken, with other places in Peraea, by Antio-

chus, is identical with the town in Gilead. (Iieland,

Palae.it. 649; Winer, s. v.; Von Raumer, Palest.

p.242; Ritter,»rf£«»/ie,vo].xv.p.l026.) [E.B.J.]

KANAH {Kurd, LXX). 1. A town in the N.

district of Asher. {Josh. xix. 28.) Dr. Robinson

recognises it in the large village of Kana, on the

brow of the Wady-'Ashur, near Tyre.

2. A river which divided the district of Manasseh

from that of Ephraim {Josh. xvi. 8, xvii. 9, 10), pro­

bably the river which discharges itself into the sea

between Caesareia and Apollonia (Arundinetis; comp.

Schultens, YitaSalad. pp. 191, 193), now the Nahr

AbuZubCira, [E.B. J.]

KAPHARABIS (Ka^opafiis), a fortified place, in

Idumaea, taken, with Kuphethra, by Cerealis, A. D.

69. (Joseph. B. J. iv. 9. § 9.) [E. B. J.]

KEDE.MOTH (BaMOjwfo, LXX.), a city in the

tribe of Reuben {Josh. xiii. 18), which gave its

name to the wilderness of Kedenioth, on the borders

of the river Arnon, from whence Moses sent mes­

sengers of peace to Sihon king of Heshbon {Dent.

ii. 26.) Its site has not been made out. (Ritter,

Erdhmde, vol. xv. pt i. pp. 574, 1208; Winer,

s. r.) [E. B. J.]
