11 53 THERA. THERA.

(xvpoiy Herod, iv. 153.) Ptolemy (iii. 15. § 26)

lias preserved the names of two places, Eleusin or

Eleusis, and Oca; and a third, called Melaenae,

occurs in an inscription. (Bockh, Inscr. no. 2448.)

Like Melos, Thera sided with the Lacedaemonians

at the commencement of the Peloponnesian War

(Thuc. ii. 9), but of its subsequent history we have

no information.

Thera and the surrounding islands are remarkable

as having been the scene of active volcanic operations

in ancient as well as in modern times. In con­

sequence of the survey made by command of the

English Admiralty, we now possess precise infor-

mation respecting these islands, the result of which,

with additional particulars, is given by Lieutenant

Leycester in a paper published in the Journal of the

Royal Geographical Society, from which the following

account is chiefly taken. Thera, now called Santorin,

the largest of the group, has been likened in form to

a horse-shoe; but a crescent with its two points elon­

gated towards the west would be a more exact de­

scription. The distance round the inner curve is 12

miles, and round the outer 18, making the coast-line

of the whole island 30 miles: its breadth is in no

part more than 3 miles. Opposite to Thera west­

ward is Therasia, which still bears the same name.

(Strab. i. p. 57, v. p. 484; Steph. 11. s. v. &npatria;

Ptol. iii. 15. § 28; I'lin. ii. 87. s. 89, iv. 12. s. 70.)

Its circuit is 7^ miles, its length front N. to S.

about 2}j miles, and its breadth a mile. About

If mile S. of Therasia, lies Aspronisi, or White

Island, only a mile in circuit, and so called from

being capped with a deep layer of pozzolana: the

name of this island is not mentioned by the ancient

writers. These three islands, Thera, Therasia, and

Aspronisi, enclose an expanse of water nearly 18

miles in circumference, which is in reality ihe

crater of a great volcano. The islands were origin­

ally united, and were subsequently separated by

the eruption of the crater. In the centre of this

basin three volcanic mountains rise, known by the

name of Kammeni or the Burnt, (Kafx^iyrj, i. e.

Kavuevn instead of ice/fallien?), and distinguished

as the Palaea or Old, the Nea or New, and the

Mikra or Little. It was formerly asserted that

the basin was unfathomable, but its depth and shape

have been clearly ascertained by the soundings of

the English Survey. Supposing the basin could be

drained, a gigantic bowl-shaped cavity would appear,

with walls 2449 feet high in some places, and no­

where less than 1200 feet high, while the Kant-

mvnis would be seen to form in the centre a huge

mountain b\ miles in circumference with three

summits, the Palaea Kammeni, (he Nea Kammeni,

and the Mikra Kammeni, rising severally from the

bottom of the abyss to the height of 1606, 1629,

and 1550 feet. The rim of the great crater thus

exposed would appear in all parts unbroken, except

at the northern point between Thera and Therasia,

where there is a chasm or door into the crater about

a mile in width, and 1170 feet in depth midway

between the two islands. (See Map, B.) If we

now suppose the waters of the Aegaean let in,

the edges of the crater, forming the inner curve of

Thera and Therasia, rise above the sea from the

height of 500 to 1200 feet, and present frightful

precipices, of the colour of iron dross, except where

their summits are capped with a deep layer of poz-

ilatm. The Palaea Kammeni is 328 feet above the

water; the Nea Kammeni 351 feet; and the Mikra

Kammeni 222 feet.

Thera, Therasia, and Aspmnisi are ill txs*:

of volcanic matter, except tJte soothers ta-" i

Thera, which contains Mount Eliot, of in*?!*

formation, the peak of which rises 1*5" f«* w

the level of the sea, and is the highest laad a

island. This mountain must hxte been orirja^ i

submarine eminence in the bed of the Mediien^a

before the volcanic cone was farmed (LyeS,

cipki of Geology, p. 445, 9tb ed \

The first appearance of the three KamanM

longs to historical times, and has been Eamai t»

several writers. The Nea Kaaandu, *fc*3 b ts»

largest of the group, did not emerge 6l tfae»«

1707; but the other two were thrown ip is i£

times. The exact time of their ipj*anHe,

ever, is differently related, and it is diScalffi

some- cases impossible, to reconcile the oc££*

statements of ancient writers upon ibe rafcjRt h
