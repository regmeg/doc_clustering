Suptt. The city was about two or three miles in

circumference; but of the walls only a few courses

of masonry have been preserved. The acropolis

stood at the south-western end of the site, below

which, on the east and north, the ground is covered

with foundations of buildings, heaps of stones, and

fragments of tiles and pottery. (Leake, Northern

Greece, vol. iv. p. 454, seq.)

SCULTENNA (SkouAtavva, Strab.: Panaro"),

a river of Gallia Cispadana, and one of the prin­

cipal of the southern tributaries of the Pad us.

(I'lin. iii. 16. s. 20; P. Diac. Hist. Lang. iv. 47.)

Jt crosses the Aemilian Way about 5 miles E. "f

Mutina (Modena), and falls into the Po a little be­

low Borukno, being the last of the tributaries of

that river which now flow into its main stream.

In the lower part of its course it now bears the

name of Panaro, but in the upper pait, before

it leaves the valleys of the Apennines, it is still

known as the Scoltenna. It has its sources in one

of the loftiest and most rugged groups of the Apen­

nines, at the foot of the Monte Gimme, and from

thence flows for many miles through a deep and

winding valley, which appears to have been the abode

of the Ligurian tribe of the Friniates. The district

still bears on old maps the title of Frignano. (Ma-

gini, Carte (f Italia, tav. 16.) In B.C. 177 the

batiks of the Scultenna were the scene of a decisive

conflict between the Ligurians and the Roman con­

sul C. Claudius, in which the former were defeated

with great slaughter (Liv. xli. 12, 18); but the

site of the battle is not more exactly indicated.

Strabo speaks of the plains on the banks of the

Scultenna, probably in the lower part of its course,

as producing wool of the finest quality. (Strab. v,

p. 218.) '[E.H.B.]

a town which, from its important position at the

debouche from the Illyrian into the plains of Paeonia

and the Upper Axius, was in all ages the frontier

town of Ulyricum towards Macedonia, There is no

evidence of its ever having been possessed by the

kings of Mac edonia or Paeonia. Under the Romans

it was ascribed to Dardania, as well in the time of

Ptolemy as in the fifth century, when it was the

capital of the new diocese of Dardania (Marqnardt,

in Becker's Horn. Alt. iii. pt. i. p. 110). The Roman

road from Stobi to Naissus passed by Scupi, which

was thus brought into connection with the great SE.

route from Viminacium on the Danube to Byzantium.

It was probably seldom under the complete authority

of Constantinople, though after the memorable vic­

tory in which, under its walls, Basil, the "Slayer

of the Bulgarians", in the beginning of the eleventh

century, avenged the defeat he had suffered from

Samuel, king of Bulgaria, twenty-one years before,

in the passes of Mt, Haemus, this city surrendered

to the Byzantine army (Cedren. p. 694). In the

reign of Michael Palaeologus it was wrested from

the emperor by the Servians, and became the

residence of the Krai (Cantacuzenus, p. 778.)

Finally, under Sultan Bayezid, Scupi, or the "Bride

of Rutnili," received a colony of Ottoman Turks

(Chalcondyles, p. 31). (Leake, Northern Greece,

vol. iii. p. 478.) [E. B. J.]
