The Paphlagonians are described by the ancients as

a superstitious, silly, and coarse people, though this

seems to apply to the inhabitants of the interior

more than to those of the coast. (Xenoph. A nab.

v. 9. § 6; Aristoph. Eq. 2, 65, 103, 110; Luciau,

Alex. 9. foil.) Besides the Paphlagonians proper

and the Greek colonists on the roa>t, we hear of tbe

Heneti and Macrones, concerning whose nationality

nothing is known: they may accordingly have been

subdivisions of the Paphlagonians themselves, or they

may hare been foreign immigrants.

Until the time of Croesus, tbe count 17 was

governed by native independent princes, but that

king made Paphlagonia a part of his empire.

(Herod, i. 28.) On the conquest of Lydia by Cyrus,

the Paphlagonians were incorporated with the lVr>:;ui

empire, in which they formed a part of the third

satrapy. (Herod, iii. 90.) But at that great dis­

tance from the seat of the government, the satraps

found it easy to assert their independence; and

independent Paphlagonian kings are accordingly

mentioned as early as the time of Xenophon

(Anal. v. 6. § 3, 9. § 2). In the time of Alex­

ander the Great, whose expedition did not touch

those northern parts, kings of Cappadoria and

Paphlagonia are still mentioned. (Arrian, A nab.

it. 4. § 1; iii. 8. § 5; Diod. Sic. aria. 16.) But

this independence, though it may have been merely

nominal, ceased soon after, and Paphlagonia and

Cappadocia fell to the share of Eumenes. (Diod.

Sic. xviii. 3; Justin, xiii. 4, 16.) After Eumenes*

death, it was again governed by native prince*,

until in the end it was incorporated with the kingdom

of Pontus by Mithridates. (Arrian, op. Phot. y. 72,

ed. Bekker; Diod. Eclog. xxxi. 3 j Justin, xxxvii. 1;

Strab. xii. p. 540; Appian, Mithrid. 11, 12.) Mi­

thridates, however, soon afterwards divided Paphla-

gonia with his neighbour Nicomedes, who made his

son, under the name of Palaemenes, king of Paphla­

gonia. (Justin, xxxvii. 3, 4.) After the conquest

of Mithridates, the Romans united the coa*>t dis­

tricts of Paphlagonia with Bithynia, but the in­

terior was again governed by native princes (Strab,

le.; Appian, B. C. ii. 71 ; Plut. Pomp. 73); and

when their race became extinct, the Romans incor­

porated the whole with their empire, and thence­

forth Paphlagonia formed a part of the province of

Galatia. (Stiab. vL p. 288, xii. pp.541, 562.)

In the new division of the empire in the fourth

century, Paphlagonia became a separate province,

only the easternmost part being cut off and added

to Pontus. (Hierocl. pp. 695, 701.) The priDcipa]

coast towns were Amastuih, EitvTiiiM, Ciu>mna,

Cttoki:», Akgialus, Abonitichos, Cim« .lis.

Stephank, Potami, Ai:mim. SmorS, and Ca-

RUSA. The whole of the interior of the country

was divided, according to Strabo, into nine districts,

viz. Blaene, Domanetis, Pimolisene, Cimiatene, Ti-

monitis, Ozatorigus, Mannolitis, Sanisenc, and Po-

tamia. The interior contained only few towns, such

as Pompeiopolis, Gangra, and some mountain for­

tresses. [L. S.]
