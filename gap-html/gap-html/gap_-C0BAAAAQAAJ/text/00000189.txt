LEUCIMXA. 171 LEUCOSYKI.

Taygcfus, and that the extent of the range is 300

•tavlta. (Camp. Theophrast. //. /'. iii. 11, iv. 1;

Plin. xvi. 33; Callim. Hymn. Man. 40.) The bold

and beautiful outline of the " White Mountains" is

still called bj its ancient title in modern Greek, to

isrpa fiowi, or, from the inhabitants, to iipaxtava

fkwa. Crete is the only part of Greece in which

the word hpn is still in common use, denoting the

loftier parts of any high mountains. Trees grow on

all these rocky mountains, except on quite the extreme

summits. The commonest tree is the prinos or

ilex. (Pashley, Trac. toI. i. p. 31, vol. ii. p. 190;

Hock. A'rrfei, vol. i. p. 19.) [E. B. J.]

LEUC1MNA. [Cobcyba, pp. 669, 670.]

LEUCOLLA (AewcoAAa), a promontory on the

south-east of Pamphylia, near .the Cilician fron­

tier. (Plin. v. 26; Liv. xxvii. 23 ; Pomp. Mela, i.

15.) In the Stadlasmus Maris Magni (§§ 190,

191) it is called Leucotheium (AcofcJtfciof). Mela

muienoaly places it at the extremity of the gulf of

Pamphylia, for it is situated iu the middle of it; its

modem name is Karaburnu. (Leake, Asia Minor,

f- 196.) [L. S.]

LEUCOLLA (A*v*oAA«, Strab. xiv. p. 6S2),

s harbour of Cyprus, N. of Cape Pedalium. It is

referred to in Athenaeus (v. p. 209, where instead

uf KcMt, Kinrpos should be read), and is identified

with Porta ArnwHo e Lucola, S. of Eatnagusta.

(Engel, Kypros, vol. i. p. 97.) [E. B. J.]

LEUCO'NIUM (Aeiwt*Vioi>). 1. A place mentioned

in the Antouine Itinerary (p. 260) in the south of

Fannonia, on the road from Aemona to Sirmium,

82 Human miles to the north-west of the latter town,

lis site is pointed out in the neighbourhood of the

village of RasboUtje.

2. A town of Ionia, of uncertain site, where

» battle was fought by the Athenians in B. c. 413.

(Thucyd. viii. 24.) From this passage it seems

clear that the place cannot be looked for on the

mainland of Asia Minor, but that it must have

been situated near Pbanae, in the island of Chios,

where a place of the name of Leuconia is said

to exist to this day. Polyaenus (viii. 66) mentions

a place. Leuconia, about the possession of which

the Chians were involved in a war with Erythrae;

and this Leuconia, which, according to Plutarch

(<it Virt. MuL vii. p. 7, ed. Reiske), was a colony

oi Chios, was probably situated on the coast of Asia

Minor, and may possibly be identical with Leucae

mi the Hermaean gulf. [Comp. Leucae.] [L. S.]

LEUCOPETRA (Aewcowrrfw), a promontory of

Bruttmm, remarkable as the extreme SW. point of

haW, looking towards the Sicilian sea and the E.

coast nf Sicily. It was in consequence generally

f^arded as the termination of the chain of the

Apennines. Pliny tells us it was 12 miles from Rhe-

pum, and this circumstance clearly identifies it

*ith the modern Capo dtW Armi, where the moun­  
tain mass of the southern Apennines in fact descends

to the sea. The whiteness of the rocks composing

tliia headland, which gave origin to the ancient

name, is noticed also by modern travellers. (Strab.

vi. p. 2f>9; Plin. iii. 5. s. 10; Ptol. iii. 1. § 9;

Swinburne, Travels, vol. i. p. 355.) It is evidently

the Mine promontory which is called by Thucydides

tlerpa Tijj Pwyrns, and was the last point in Italy

wiiere Demosthenes and Eurymedon touched with

tte Athenian armament before they crossed over to

Seir/. (Thuc. vii. 35.) It was here also that Cicero

trailed on his voyage from Sicily, when, after the

death of Caesar, B. c 44. he was preparing to rc-

pair into Greece, and where he was visited by some

friends from Rhegium, who brought news from

Rome that induced him to alter his plans. (Cic.

PkiL i. 3, ad Alt. xvi. 7.) In the former passage

he terms it "promontorium agri Rhegini:" the

"Leucopetra Tarentinorum" mentioned by him

(ad AtL xvi. 6), if it be not a false reading, must

refer to quite a different place, probably the head­

land of Leuca, more commonly called the Iapygian

promontory. [Leuca.] [E. H. B.j

LEUCOPHRYS (AewtoVppus), a town in Caria,

apparently in the plain of the Maeander, on the

borders of a lake, whose water was hot and in con­

stant commotion. (Xenoph. Hell. iv. 8. § 17, iii. 2.

§ 19.) From the latter of the passages here re­

ferred to, we learn that the town possessed a very

revered sanctuary of Artemis; hence sumamed Ar­

temis Leucophryene or Leucophrvne. (Pans. i. 26.

§4; Strab. xiv. p. 647; Tac Attn. iii. 62.) The

poet Nicander spoke of Leucophrys as a place dis­

tinguished for its fine roses. (Atlicn. xv. p. 683.)

Respecting Leucophrys, the ancient name of Te-

nedos, sec Tekedos. [L S.]

LEUCO'SIA (AeoKwta), a small island off the

coast of Lucania, separated only by a narrow chan­

nel from the headland which forms the southern

boundary of the gulf of Paestum. This headland

is called by Lycophron Ajctt/ 'EciireW, "the pro­

montory of Neptune," and his commentators tell us

that it was commonly known as Posidium Promon­

torium (to rio(7«(57jiof). (Lyeophr. Alex. 722; and

Tzetz. ad loc.) But no such name is found in the

geographers, and it seems probable that the promon­

tory itself, as well as the little island off it, was

known by the name of Lencosia. The former is

still called Pttnta delia Licosa; the islet, which is a

mere rock, is known as /tola Fiona. It is generally

said to have derived its ancient name from one of the

Sirens, who was snpposed to have been buried there

(Lyeophr. I. c.; Strab. /. c.; Plin. iii. 7. a. 13);

but Dionysius (who writes the name Leucasia) as­

serts that it was named after a female cousin of

Aeneas, and the same account is adopted by Solinus.

(Dionys. i. 53; Solin. 2. § 13.) We learn from

Symmachus (£/>/>. v. 13, vi. 25) that the opposite

promontory was selected by wealthy Romans as a

site for their villas; and the remains of ancient

buildings, which have been discovered on the little

island itself, prove that the latter was also re­

sorted to for similar purposes. (Romanelli, vol. i.

p. 345.) [E. H. B.]

LEUCO'SIA (\tvKuaia, AtvKovtrta), a city of

Cyprus, which is mentioned only by Hierocles and

the ecclesiastical historian Sozomen (II. E. i. 3,10).

The name is preserved in the modern Lefkosia or

Nikosia, the capital of the island. (Engel, Kypros,

vol. i. p. 150; Manti, Viaggi, vol. i. p. 89; Pocockc,

Trav. in the East, vol. ii. pt. 1. p. 221.) [E. B. J.]

LEUCOSYR1 (AfVKoVtyoi), the ancient name of

the Syrians inhabiting Cappadocia, by which they

were distinguished from the more southern Syrians,

who were of a darker complexion. (Herod, i. 72,

vii. 72; Strab. xvi. p. 737; Plin. H. N. vi. 3;

Eustath. ad Dionys. 772, 970.) They also spread

over the western parts of Pontns, between the rivers

Iris and Halys. In the time of Xenophon (Jnao. v. 6.

§ 8, &c.) they were united with Paphlagonia, and

governed by a Paphlagoniun prince, who is said to

have had an army of 120,000 men, mostly horse­

men. This name was often used by the Greeks, even

at the time when it had become customary to desig­
