face has been heightened, its superlicial area has nut

been materially enlarged since the country wa.s peopled.

Pharos was inhabited by fishermen under the

Pharaohs of Aegypt; but it first became a place of

importance under the Macedonian kings. During

his survey of tile coast, B. c. 332, Alexander the

Great perceived that the island would form, with

the help of art, an excellent breakwater to the har­

bour of liis projected capital. He accordingly caused

its southern extremity to be connected with the main­

land by a stone mole seven stadia, or about an

English mile, in length, which from this circum­

stance was called the Heptastadium or Seven-

furlong Bridge. At either end the mole was left

open for the passage of ships, and the apertures

were covered by suspension bridges. In later times

a street of houses, erected on the mole itself, con­

verted the island of Pharos into a suburb of Alex­

andria, and a considerable portion of the modern

city stands on the foundations of the old Hepta­

stadium.

Yet, long after its junction with the Delta, Pharos

was spoken of as an island iroAxu vrjtros, Aelian,

//. An. ix. 21; rovp6rtpov Wjaoj, Zonar. iv. 10).

The southern portion of this rocky ledge (j(tnp&s)

was the more densely populated; but the celebrated

lighthouse, or the Tower of the Pharos, stood at the

NK. point, directly in a line with point Pharillon, on

the eastern horn of the Xevv Port. The lighthouse

was erected, at a cost of 800 talents, in the reign of

Ptolemy I., but was not completed until that of his

successor Philadelphia. Its architect was Sostratus

of Cnidus, who, according to Pliny (xxxvi. 12. s. 18),

was permitted by bis royal patron to inscribe his

own name upon its base. There is indeed another

story, in which it is related that Sostratus, being

forbidden to engrave his name on his work, secretly

cut it in deep letters on a stone of the building,

which he then adroitly covered with some softer and

perishable material, on which were inscribed the

style and titles of Ptolemy. Tims a few genera­

tions would read the name of the king, but posterity

would behold the authentic impress of the archi­

tect. (Strab. x\ii. p. 791; Suidas,s. v. &dpos; Steph.

B. s. v.; Lucian, de Conscrib. Hist, c C2.) Pharos

wa.s the seat, of several temples, tho most conspi­

cuous of which was one dedicated to Hephaestos,

standing near the northern extremity of the Hepta­

stadium.

That Pharos, in common with many of the Deltaic

cities, contained a considerable population of Jews,

is rendered probable by the fact that here the trans­

lators of the Hebrew Scriptures resided during the

progress of their work. (Joseph. Atttiq. xii. 2. § 13,)

Julius Caesar established a colony at Pharos, less

perhaps to recruit a declining population than with

a view t-» garrison a post so important as regarded

the turbulent Alexandrians. (Caesar, £. CVr.iii. 112.)

Subsequently the island seems to have been com­

paratively deserted, and inhabited by fishermen alone.
