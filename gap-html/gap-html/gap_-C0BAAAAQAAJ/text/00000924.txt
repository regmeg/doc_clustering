of these fields in the district called Vaticamis:

"Aranii quatuor Biiajugera in Vaticano, quae prata

Quinctia appellantur, Cincinnato viator attulit dic-

taturam" (xviii. 4). That the Xavalia were in

the Campus Martins may also be inferred from

Livy (xlv. 42): "Naves regiae captae de Mace-

donibus inusitatae ante magnitudinis in Catnpo

Martio subductae sunt"; and from Plutarch's ac­

count of the return of tbe younger Cato from

Cyprus, in which he relates that although the ma­

gistrates and senate, as well as a great part of the

Roman population, were ranged along both banks of

the Tiber in order to greet him, yet he did not stop

the course of his vessels till he arrived at the

Navalia (Cat Min. 39); a circumstance which

shows that this arsenal must have lain towards

the upper part of the stream's course through

the city. Hence, though we cannot define the

boundary between the Janieulum and the Vatican, j

nor consequently the exact situation of the Prata;

Quinctia, yet the site fixed upon by Becker for the'

Navalia, namely, between the Piazza. Xarona and 1

f'orOj diRipitta, seems sufficiently probable. I'reller

is disposed to place them rather lower down the

stream, but without any adequate reason (Regionen,

Ann. p. 242).

It was Caesar who began the great changes in

the Campus Martins to which we have before

alluded. He had at one time meditated the gigantic

plan of diverting the course of the 'liber from the

Milvian bridge to the Vatican hill, by which the

Ager Vaticanus would have been converted into a

new Campus Martins, and the ancient one appro­

priated to building; but this project was never car­

ried into execution. (Cic. ad Ait. xiii. .33.) The

only building which he really began in the Campus

was the Skfta JruA. Jt has been said, when

treating of the Porta Flumentana, that a spot near

the Circus Flaminins was appropriated to the hold­

ing of the Coinitia Centuriata. In early times it

was enclosed with a rude kind of fence or boundary,

probably of hurdles: whence, from its resemblance

to a sheep-fold, it obtained the name of Ovile, and

subsequently of Septa. (Liv. xxvi. 22; Juv. vi. 528;

Serv, ad Virg. Ac. i. 34.) For this simple and

primitive fence Caesar substituted a marble building

(Septa marmorea), which was to be surrounded with

a portico a mile square, and to be connected with;

the Villa Publico, (Cic. ad AH. iv. 16.) It was

probably not much advanced at tbe time of Caesar's

assassination; since we find that it was continued

by the triumvir Lepidus, and finally dedicated by

Agrippa (l>ion Cass. liii. 23); hut whether it was |

completed on tbe magnificent plan described by \

Cicero cannot be said. Its situation may be deter- j

mined by a parage in Frontinus. in which he says I

that the arches of the Aqua Virgo ended in the

Campus Martins in front of the Septa. (Aq. 22.)

These arches, which, as we have seen before, began

under the gardens of Lucullus on the Pincian, were

conducted to the baths of Agrippa. Donati men­

tions that remains of them were discovered in Ins [

time in trout of the church of S. fyiMzit) (near the j

CMgio Romano), (De L'rb. R. iii. 18.) This

coincides with remains of the portico of the Septa!

existing under the Palazzo Dovia and church of

*S". Maria in Via Lata in the Corto (Canina, Indie. -  
400); and we may therefore conclude that the Septa

Julia stood at this spot. The portico must have 1

enclosed a large open space where the assemblies

were held, and in which gladiatorial shows, and on I

one occasion even a naurnaeh'u, were fslu-.^t

(Suet. Aug. 43, Col. 18, A'er. 12; Dion Cms it.

8, lis. 10.) There was of eour>e a s>or£?*Ki3 «■

rostra, for haranguing the people. (I>k«i Ca&w In. 1.1

Tbe Septa were destroyed iu the great 6r? h-jt

Titus (Dion Cass. Ivi. 24). but must hm t«a

restored, since, in the time of Domitian, *,vo

had lost their political importance, they appear a

have been used as a market, in which tbe ewJ

valuable objects were exposed for sale. (Mart. a.

60.) They appear to have undergone a sabee-^a

restoration under Hadrian. (Span. Hadr. 19.;

The Villa Piblica adjoined tbe Sept* J--*,

simple building, and is mentioned by Lrrr (it.H)

as early as the year b. c. 436. It """is u^d it :jf
