MENESTHEI. 3G9 MENUTHIAS.

Mta, situated to SE. of the highroad between

Alrxandn-ia and Hermopolis, near the Canonic arm

of the Nile. It derived its name from Menelaus, a

brother of Ptolemy Lagus, and attained such import­

ance as to confer the title of Menelaites upon the

Csnopic branch of the river. (Ptol. iv. 5. § 9; Strab.

ii. p.S0I.) [W. B. D.]

MENESTHEI POBTUS (4 Mtrureius a.^i-),

a hirUur of Hispania Baetica, between Gades and

A>ta. (Strab. iii. p. 140; Ptol. ii. 4. § 5; Man-inn.

u. 40.) In its neighbourhood was the oracle of

Mrnestheus (Strab. /. c), to whom, also, the in­

habitants of Gades offered sacrifices. (Philostr. Vit.

Apoll. v. 1.) The Scholiast on Thucydides (i. 12)

relates that Menestheus, being expelled by the

Tbeeidae, went to Iberia. The harbour is probably

tlit modern Puerto de S. Maria.

HEXINX (Miju-yJ, al. Mr>rv{), an island off

the N. coast of Africa, to the SE. of the Lesser

Syrtia. It is first described by Scylax (p. 48),

who calls it Braciiion (Bpagf {up), and states that

Ha length was 300 stadia, while its breadth was

something less. Pliny (v. 7) makes the length

2.3 II. P. and the breadth 22 M. P. Its distance

from the mainland was about 3 stadia (8 stadia,

Siadiam. p. 455), and one day's sail from Taricheae.

It was the abode of the "dreamy Lotos-eaters"

[Lotophagi], for which reason it was called Lo-

tophagitis (Attrro^xryiVit, Ptol. iv. 3. § 35;

AsnjQdytfr ptjo-os, Polyb. i. 39 ; comp. Strab. i.

r 25. ii. p. 123, iii. p. 157, xvii. p. 834; Pomp.'

Mela, ii. 7. § 7; Plin. I. c. ix. 60 ; Dionys. v. 180).

The Bomans first became acquainted with it, by the

disastrous expedition of C. Scmpronius Blaesus,

a.c 253. (I'olyb. I. c.; comp. Zonar. viii. 14;

One. iv. 9.) It contained two towns, Meninx and

Thoar, and was the birthplace of the emperors

Galhts Trebonianus, and his son, Volusianus (Aurel.

Victor, Epit. 31), when it was already knuwn by

the name of Gikba. Jtrbah, as the island is now

called, produces the u lotus Zizypbus," a tree-fruit

lie beans. (Shaw, Trac. p. 197; Rcnnell, Geog.

oflimd. vol. ii. p. 287; Barth, Wandcrungen,

pp. S63. 287.) [E. B. J.]

1IEXXIS (Curt. v. 1. § 16), a Bmall town of

Mesopotamia, at which Alexander halted in bis

march from Arbeht to Bubylon. Curtius stated

thit it was celebrated for its naphtha pits,—which

■noted abound in that part of Asia. [V.]

MESOBA (Pun. iii. 1. a. 3) or MENUBA (In-

str.ap, Florez, Esp. Sagr. ix. p. 47), a tributary of

the river Baelis, on its right side, now the Gua-

dunmr.

HEXOSCA (Mm-do-a-o, Ptol. ii. 6. § 9; Plin. iv.

JO. a 34), a town of the Varduli, on the N. coast of

Ktepmia Tarraconensis. Its site is uncertain. Some

pUce it at Si. Sebtulian; others at St. Andre; and

other?, apain, at Sumaga,

'IEXOSGADA (Mnvoo-vciSo), a place in central

Germany, tK>t far from the sources of the Main

(Muenus). from which it, no doubt, derived its

»t (Ptol. ii. 11. § 29.) Its site is generally

haierfd to have been that of the modem MainrolA,

oar Ctilmbach. [L. S.]

HENTESA. 1. Snmamed Bastia {it. Anton.

p.402; Uentiasa, Liv. xxvi. 17; Mwriffa, Ptol. ii.

*■ i 59), a town of the Oretani in Hispania Tarra-  
c:ca,9te,on the road from Carthago Nova to Castulo,

a*! 22 Koman miles from Castulo. Pliny (iii. 3.

a. 4) calls the inhabitants " Mentesani, qui et Ore-

tui," to distinguish them from the following.

2. A small state of the Bastuli, in Hispania

Baetica. (*'Mentesani, qui et Bastuli," Plin. I. c;

Inscr. Grater, p. 384, 2; Florez, £tp. Sagr. v.

p. 24.)

MKNT0N0M0N, an aestuary or bay of the

Northern Ocean, mentioned by Pytheas, upon which

the Guttones dwelt, and at a day's sail from which

was an island named Abalus, where amber was

gathered. (Plin. xxxvii. 7. s- 11.) The same island

is mentioned in another passage of Pliny (iv. 13. s.

27), as situated a day's sail from the Scythian coast.

In Sillig's edition of Pliny this part of Scythia is

called Raunonia ; but some of the MSS. and older

editions have Bannonianna or Bantomannia, which

is apparently only another form of Mentonomon.

The bay was no doubt on the Prussian coast in the

Baltic. (Zeuss, Die Dtutschen. $c. p. 269.)

MENTORES (Me>ropes), a Libumian tribe

(Hecatae. Fr. 62, ed. Klausen; Plin. iii. 21. s. 25),

off whose coast were the three islands called Men-

torides, probably the same as the rocky islands of

Pago, Osero, and Arhe. [E. B. J.]

MENU'THIAS (MfKouflms, Steph. B.), an island

off the E. coast of Africa. Ptolemy (iv. 8. § 2,

comp. vii. 2. § 1) describes it as being adjacent

(ToodjcciTai) to the Prom. Prasum; at the same

time he removes it 5° from the continent, and places

it at 85° long., 12° 30' hit., to the NE. (a»o 3e-

ptvuv di'aroAui') of Prasum. The graduation of

Ptolemy's map is here so erroneous, that it is im­

passible to make out the position of his island

Menuthias, which some have identified with one uf

the islands of Zanzibar, or even with Madagascar.

(Vincent, Navigation of the Ancients, vol. ii. pp.

174—185; Gosselin, Geographic des Anciens, vol. i.

pp. 191,195.) The simple narrative of the Periplus

gives a very faithful picture of this coast, — har­

monising with the statements of Ptolemy and Ma-

rinus of Tyre,—as far as the Rhaptus of the former

(Govind, or the river of Jubah). Afterwards it

thus proceeds (p. 9, ed. Hudson):—

"Thence" (from the Nova Fossa, "New Cut,"

or " Channel," or the opening of the coral reefs by

Govind), "at the distance of two natural days' sail,

on a course a little above Libs (S\V.), Menuthias

island occurs on the W. (the important words " Duo

West"—trap* avr))vr^vivaiy—are arbitrarilyaltered

ia Blancard's edition to the opposite sense, with a

view to force the author into agreement with Pto­

lemy; comp. Annot. ad Hudson, p. 68), about

300 stadia from the mainland, low, and covered

with wood, with streams, plenty of birds of various

kinds, and land-turtle. But, excepting crocodiies,

which are harmless, it has no other animals. At

this island there are boats, both sewed together, and

hollowed out of single trunks, which are used for

fishing, and catching turtle. Here, they take fish

in wicker baskets, which are let down in front of

the hollows of the rocks." It appears, therefore,

that Menuthias was distant about two days' sail

from Nova Fossa, or 60 or 80 miles from the river

Gevind, just where an opening in the coral reefs is

now found. The coasting voyager, steering SW.,

reached the island on the E. side,—a pruof that it

was close to the main; a contiguity which perhaps

is further shown by the presence of the crocodiles;

though much stress cannot be laid upon this point, as

they may have been only lizards. It is true, the

navigator says that it was 300 stadia from the

mainland; but as there is no reason to suppose that

he surveyed the island, this distance must be taken
