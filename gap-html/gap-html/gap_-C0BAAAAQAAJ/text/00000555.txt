Tbt* mmds no doubt that the Oenotrians were a

ftBtric race, akin to the population of Epirus and

'BB mkcuy tiie opinion of those Greek writers who

Bsaantid Oenotnu as one of the sons of I.ycaon,

and on the road from Viminacium to Nieomedia,

12 miles E. from Valeriana, and 14 miles W. from

Utum. (/fin. Ant. p. 220.) It was the station of

the Legio V. Maced. Procopius, who calls the town

'Icntdj, says that it was fortified by Justinian (ofe

Aed. iv. 6). Usually identified with Oreszoritz,

though some hold it to be Glava.

2. A river of Lower Moesia, called by Thucydides

(ii. 96) "Oo-aioi, and by Herodotus (iv. 49) 5«.o«.

Pliny (iii. 26. s. 29) places its source in Mount

Rhodopc; Thucydides (i. c.) in Mount Scomius,

which adjoined Rhodope. Its true source, however,

is on the W. side of Haemus, whence it pursues its

course to the Danube. It is now called the laker or

Eaker. [T. H. D.]

(Thuc. 1. c.) Its position must be sought at some

point on the coast between NefUr and the mouth of

the Strymon. (Leake, Northern Greece, vol. iii. p.

OETA (Qtrn: Eth. Orrcuot), a mountain in the

south of Thessaly, which branches off from Mt.

Pindus, runs, in a south-easterly direction, and forms

the northern barrier of Central Greece. The only

entrance into Central Greece from the north is

through the narrow opening left between Mt. Oets

and the sea, celebrated as the pass of Thermopylae.

[Thermopylae]. Mt. Oeta is now called Katavo-

thra, and its highest summit is 7071 feet. (Journal

of Geogr. Soc. vol. vii. p. 94.) The mountain im­

mediately above Thermopylae is called Callidromon

both by Strabo and I.ivy. (Strab. ix. p. 428; Liv.

xxxvi. 15.) The latter writer says that Callidro­

mon is the highest summit of Mt. Oeta; and Strabo

agrees with him in describing the summit nearest to

Thermopylae as the highest part of the range; but

in this opinion they were both mistaken, Mt. Patrio-

tika, which lies more to the west, being considerably

higher. Strabo describes the proper Oeta as 200

stadia in length. It is celebrated in mythology as the

scene of the death of Hercules, whence the Roman

poets give to this hero the epithet of Oetaeus. From

this mountain the southern district of Thessaly was

called Oetaea (OiVaTo, Strab. ix. pp. 430, 432. 434),

and its inhabitants Oetaei (Oi'tcuoi, Herod, vii. 217;

Thuc. iii. 92; Strab. ix. p. 416). There was also a

city, Oeta, said to have been founded by Amphissus,

son of Apollo and Dryope (Anton. Liberal, c. 32),

which Stephanus B. (*. r.) describes as a city of the

Malians. Leake places it at the foot of SIt. Patri-

otiko, and conjectures that it was the same as the

sacred city mentioned by Callimachus. (//ymn. in

ZW.287.) [See Vol. II. p. 255.] (Leake, Aortliern

Greece, vol. ii. p. 4, seq.)
