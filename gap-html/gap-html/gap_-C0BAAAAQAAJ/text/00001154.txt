1068 STRACUSAE. SYRACUSAE.

is the Olympieum, or Temple, of Jupiter Olympius,

which stood, as already mentioned, on a height,

facing the southern front of Epipolae and Neapolis,

from which it was about a mile and a half distant

(Liv. xxiv. 33), the interval being occupied by the

marshy plain on the hanks of the Anapus. The

sanctuary seems to have early attained great cele­

brity: even at the time of the Athenian expe­

dition there had already grown up around it a small

town, which was known as Poljchnb (tj Xlo\ix"V,

Diod,), or the Little City. The military importance

of the post, as commanding the bridge over the

Anapus and the road to Hetorus, as well as over­

looking the marshes, the Great Harbour, and the

lower part of the city, caused the Syracusans to

fortify and secure it with a garrison before the ar­

rival of the Athenians. (Time. vi. 75.) For the

same reason it was occupied by all subsequent in­

vaders who threatened .Syracuse; by Himilco in B.C.

396, by Hamilcar in u. c. 309, and by Marcellus

in b. c, 214. The remains of the temple are still

visible; in the days of Cluverius, indeed, seven co­

lumns were still standing, with a considerable part

of the substructure (Cluver. Sicil. p. 179), but now

only two remain, and those have lost their capitals.

They are of an ancient style, and belong probably to

the original temple, which appears to have been

built by the Geomori as early as the Gth century

n. c.

The adjoining promontory of Plemmyrium docs

not appear to have been ever inhabited, though it

presents a table-land of considerable height, nor

was it ever permanently fortified. It is evident

also, from the account of the operations of successive

Carthaeinian fleets, as well as that of the Athenians,

that the Syracusans had not attempted to occupy,

or even to guard with forts, the more distant parts

of the Great Harbour, though the docks or arsenal,

which were situated in the inner bight or recess of

the bay, between Ortygia and the lower part of

Achradma, were strongly fortified. The southern

binhl of the bay, which forms an inner bay or gulf,

now known ,is the bay of Sta Maddtilena, is evidently

that noticed both during the Athenian sieee and

that by the Carthaginians as the gulf of Dascon.

(AdtTKwu, Time. vi. GG; Diod, xiii. 13, si v. 72.)

The fort erected by the Athenians for the protection

of their fleet apparently stood on the adjacent height, I

which is connected with that of the Olympieum.

Almost immediately at the foot of the Olympieum

was the ancient bridge across the Anapus, some re-

mains of which may still be seen, as well as of the

ancient road which led from it towards Helorus,

memorable on account of the disastrous retreat of

the Athenians. They did not, however, on that

occasion cross the bridge, but after a fruitless at­

tempt to penetrate into the interior by following the

valley of the Anapus, struck across into the He-

lotine W ay, which they rejoined some distance be­

yond the Olympieum, Not far from the bridge over

the Anapus stood the monument of Gclon and his

wife Demarete, a sumptuous structure, where the

feyracusans were in the habit of paying heroic

honours to their great ruler. It was adorned with

rune towers of a very massive construction; but the

monument itself was destroyed by Himilco, when

he encamped at the adjacent Olympieum, and the

towers were afterwards demolished by Agatnodes.

(Diod. xi. 38, xiv. 63.)

About a mile and a half SW. of the Olympieum is

the fountain of Cyanic, a copious and clear stream

rising in the midst of a marsh: thestactatn 4&

nymph to whom it was consecrated (rir^ Kic?n

Upov, Diod.), must have stO"d on the hei^i-ta &n

as we are told that I>ionysius led his tro^ roc.

this spot with a view to attack the Cartavaa*,

camp at the Olympieum (Diod. xir. 72); iai >

marsh itself must always have been impa^-ai-;1 ;t

troops. Some ruins on the slope of tiwtuuU L'/

W. of the source are probably those of the tart* a
