loss what to do. On the western side of the town

there is a rapid torrent, impassable during the greater

part of the winter, and which, rushim; down from

the mountains, makes the city exceedingly strong

and inaccessible, in consequence of the size of the

ravine which it lias gradually formed. On the east­

ern side Hows the Krymanthus,a lar^e and impetuous

river, concerning which there are so many stories.

As the western torrent joins the Krymanthus on the

southern side of the city, its three sides are sur­

rounded by rivers, and rendered secure in the manner

de«icribed. On the remaining hide towards the north

a strong bill hangs over, surrounded by a wall, and

serving the purjio.se of a well-placed citadel. The

town itself also is provided with walls, remarkable

for their size and construction.'' (Polyb. iv. 70.)

From this description it is evident that the Eryman-

thus on the eastern side of the city is the river of

Supitfo; and that the western torrent, which we learn

from l*au>anias (viii. 24. § 3) bore the name of Aro-

anius, is the river of Ght rmotzt'ma. About 300 feet

below the junction of these rivers the united stream

is joined by a third, smaller than the other two,

called the river of Lopts'i or Sk*ipi} which rises on

the frontiers of Cleitor, near Seirae. From these

three rivers the place is now called Trtpotamo.

The banks of the Krymanthus and the Aroantu^ are

precipitous, but not very high; and between them

and the steep summit of the hill upon which the

town stood there is a small space of level or gently-

rising ground. The summit is a sharp ridge, sending

forth two roots, one of which descends nearly to the

iinqle of junction of the two streams, the other

almost to the bank of the Krymanthus at the eastern

extremity of the city. (Leake, Mono, vol. ii.

p. 242.)

Philip, in Ids attack upon Psophis, crossed the

bridge over the Krymanthus, which was probably in

the same position as the modern bridge, and then

drew up his men in the narrow space between the

river and the walls. While the Macedonians were

attempting to scale the walls in three separate parties,

the Kleians made a sally from a gate in the up]»er

part of the town. They were, however, driven back

by the Cretans in Philip's army, who followed the

fugitives into the town. Kuripidas and the garrison

then retreated into the citadel, and shortly afterwards

surrendered to Philip. (Polyb. iv. 71, 72.)

Pausanias saw at Psophis a ruined temple ofAphro-

dite Erycina, heroa of Proinuehus and Kchepliron,

the tomb of Alcmaeon, and near the Krymanthus a

temple sacred to that stream. (Pans. viii. 24. § 7.)

Leake aho noticed a part of a theatre, not mentioned

by Pausania*, on the side of the hill towards the

Aroanius. Nine hundred feet above the junction of

the two rivers, and near the walls on the bank of the

Krymanthus, Leake also found some remains of a

public building, 00 feet in length, below which there

is a source of water in the bank. lie conjectures

that they may be the remains of the temple of Kry­

manthus.

Psophis was about 2 miles in circumference. The

town-walls followed the crest, of the ridge to the

northward and the bank above the two rivers on the

opposite side ; and they are traceable nearly through­

out the entire circuit of the place. On the north­

eastern side of the town, which is the only part not

protected by the two rivers or by the precipices at

the back of the hill, there was a double inelosure.

Leake could not trace the inclosure of the citadel.

At the distance of ."10 stadia from Psophis was

Seirae (Sfipoi). which Pausanias de-*crib« a* *- *

boundary of the Psophidii and CWitorii (vui-2o
