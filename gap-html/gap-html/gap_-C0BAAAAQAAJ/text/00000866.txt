cupied by the magistrates it appears to have been

open to the people. Thus, the senate being as­

sembled in the curia to hear the ambassadors of

those made prisoners at the battle of Cannae, the

people are represented as filling the cornitium:

"Ubi is tinem fecit, extemplo ab ea turba. quae in

comitio erat, clamor flebilis est sublatus, manusque

ad curiam tendentes, &c." (Id. xxii. 60.) Being

the place for the contiones it of course had a sug-

gestum, or rostra, from which speeches were de­

livered; but we shall have occasion to describe this

and other objects on and around the cornitium and

forum when we arrive at them in their chronological

order.

It was not till after the preceding account of the

cornitium had been committed to paper that the

writer of it met with the essay on the cornitium by

Mommsen in the Annali deW /H,*f/j7ufo(vol. xvi.), to

which reference lias before been made. The writer

was glad to perceive that his general view of the

situation of the cornitium had been antiei^tcd,

although he is unable to concur with Mommsen

respecting some of the details; such as the situation

of the Curia Hostilia, of the temple of Janus, of the

Forum Caesarls, and some other objects. In re­

futing Becker's views, Mommsen has used much the

same arguments, though not in such detail, as those

just adduced; but he has likewise thought it worth

while to refute an argument from a passage in

Herodian incidentally adduced by Becker in a note

(p. 332). As some persons, however, may be dis­

posed to attribute more weight to that argument

than we Jo ourselves, we shall here quote Momm-

sen's refutation: "Minus etiam probat alterum,

quod a lieckero, p. 332, n. 612, affertur, argumentum

desumtum ex narratione Herodianl, i. 9, Severutn

aia((v referantur ad r^v dpx'hv neque ad tiji

ayopas, quod multo est Bimplicius. Nam ut optime

quasi in foro insistere vide*,ur qui rerum Romanarum

potiturns est, ita de comitio eo tempore inepte haec

dicerentur; accedit quod, si ad ttjv dpxhv TV$

(p. 289).

So much for the negative side of the question:

on the positive side Mommsen adduces (p. 299) an

argument which had not occurred to the writer of

the present article in proof of the position above

indicated for the cornitium. It is drawn from the

Sacrum Cluacinae. That shrine. Mommsen argues,

stood by the Tabernae Novae, that is, near the arch of

Severus, as Becker has correctly shown {/landb.

p. 321) from Livy iii. 48; but lie has done wrong

in rejecting the result that may be drawn from the

comparison of the two legends; first, that the

comitium was so called because Romulus and

Tatius met upon it after the battle (p. 273);

second, that the Romans and Sabines cleansed them­

selves, after laying aside their arms, at the spot

where the statue of Venus Cluacina afterwards stood

(IMiit. xv. 18. s. 36); whence it follows that the

statue was on the cornitium. A fresh confirmation,

Mommsen continues, may be added to this discovery

of the truth. For that the Tab?rr* *ere cr t^a

comitium, and not on the forum, t& jjerkr ay-

poses, is pretty clearly shown by Dionysss (t*

We are not, however, disposed to lay any r**
