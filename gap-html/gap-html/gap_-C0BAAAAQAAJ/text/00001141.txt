orcamferesce, and as possessing eight harbours

'an. t. 31, 133) and a town of the same name as

- ;-Utsd. The island itself is very high but  
rrvn. According to Stephanus B. (s. v.; comp.

ben. wii. p. 296) Syme was formerly called

rupontis and Aegle, and obtained iu later name

mi Seme, * daughter of lalysus, who, together

U£n Syrnnada on his way from Kphesus to Cilicia.

«rabo'* time (xii. p. 577) it was still a small

i, but wben Pliny wrote (v. 29) it was an im-

aut place, being the conventus juridicus for the

whole of the surrounding country. It was very

celebrated among the Romans for a beautiful kind of

marble furnished by the neighbouring quarries, aqd

which was commonly called Synnadic marble,

though it came properly from a place in the neigh­

bourhood, Docimia, whence it was more correctly

called Docimites lapis. This marble was of a light

colour, interspersed with purple spots and veins.

Comp. Steph. B. s. ».; Ptol. v. 2. § 24; Martial,

pearances of extensive quarries between Kosru-Khatt

and Bultcudun, which Co). Leake (Asia Minor, p.

36) is inclined to identify with those of Synnada or

Docimia. Remains of the town of Synnada still

exist under the name Eski-kara-hissar about 3 miles

to the north-west of these quarries, where they were

discovered by Texier. Earlier travellers imagined

they had found them at Surmina or Surmeneh, or

in the plain of Sandakleh. (Comp. Hamilton, Re­

situated in a deep gorge between two hills, where

Gabinius was defeated, and to which the Dal­

matians retreated in the campaign of u. c. 34.

OcUvius, suspecting their intentions, sent skirmish­

ers over the high ground while he advanced through

the valley and burnt Synodium. [E. B. J.]

SYRACU'SAE (ZvpaKovoat: Eth. iupaKOvoios,

form ZvpdKoViot, which, as we learn from coins

and inscriptions, was the native form; Syracusanus:

Siracusa, Syracuse), the most powerful and im­

portant of all the Greek cities in Sicily, situated on

the E. coast of the island, about midway between

Catana and Cape Pachynus. Its situation ex-

en iscd so important an influence upon its history

and progress, that it will be desirable to describe

this somewhat more fully before proceeding to the

history of the city, reserving, at the same time, tliu

topographical details for subsequent discussion.

I. Situation.

Syracuse was situated on a table-land or tabular

hill, forming the prolongation of a ridge which

branches off from the more elevated table-land of tlio

interior, and projects quite down to the sea, between

the bay known as the Great Harbour of Syracuse,

and the more extensive bay which stretches on the

N. as far as the peninsula of Tiiafsi's or Magnisi.

The broad end of the kind of promontory thus

funned, which abuts upon the sea for a distance »»f

about 2j miles, may be considered as the base of a

triangular plateau which extends for above 4 mill*

into the interior, having its apex formed by the

point now called Monyilellisi, which was occupied

by the ancient fort of Eliiyalcs. This communi­

cates, as already stated, by a narrow ridge with the

table-land of the interior, but is still a maiked

point of separation, and was the highest point of
