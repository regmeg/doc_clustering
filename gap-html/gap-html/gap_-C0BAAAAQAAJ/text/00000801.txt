RETYPES. RIGODUNUM. 717

TV Scholiast on Apollonius Rbodins (!. 1165) states

ifcsl in UtT times the Rhyndacns, after receiving

Lh« waters of the Megistns, was itself called Me-

M»i but Eostathius {ad Horn. II. xiii. 771) as-

r:rrt us that in his time it still bore the name of

fcJirolicas. According to Valerias Flaccus (iii.

15) its reUow waters were discernible in the sea at a

rrrit distance from its mouth. In B. c. 73 Lucullus

rxwd a victory orer Mithridates on the banks of

N. t. I. §5 4, 8; Steph. B. *. v.) The Rhyn-

'Mrgistui {Susvghirli) it bears the name of Mn-

b'i&a or WcolUsa. (See Hamilton's Retearchet,

"rationed by Aeschylus as itfpawiai 'Puitaj,

Erineum to hare been its port and to have

Dmitri The position of Lambtri answers very

does not appear sufficient for rejecting the

"to Aegium and Rhypes. (Leake, Ptloporme-

RIBLAH ('PaffAad», a city "in the land of

Hamath," where Jehoahaz or Shallum was cast

into chains by Pharaoh Necho, and where Nebuchad­

nezzar subsequently gave judgment on Zedekiah.

(2 Kings, xxiii. 33, xxv. 6.) We find Nebnchad.

nezzar there again, after an interval of ten years,

when the last remnant was carried captive and slain

there. {Jerem. Iii. 27.) [G. W.]

RICCIACUM, in North Gallia. The Table has

a road from Divodurum {Metz) to Augusta Tre-

virorum (7Vi'er). From Divodurum to Caranusca

is xlli., from Caranusca to Ricciacum x., and from

Ricciacum to Augusta x. D'Anville guessed Ric­

ciacum to be Remich on the Motel; but it is only

a guess. There is evidently an error in the Table

in the distance between Divodurum and Ricciacum,

which is a great deal too much. The geographers

have handled this matter in various ways. [Ca­

ranusca.] (See also Ukert, Gallien, p. 512, and

the note.) [G. L.]

RICINA. 1. {Eth. Ricinensis: Ru. near Ma-

cerala), a municipal town of Picenum, situated on

a hill above the right bank of the river Potentia

{Potema), about 15 miles from the sea. Pliny is

the only geographer that mentions it (iii. 13. s. 18);

but the "ager Ricinensis" is noticed also in the

Liber Coloniarum (p. 226), and we learn from an

inscription that it received a colony under the em­

peror Severus, and assumed in consequence the title

of " Colonia Helvia Ricina" (Orell. Inter. 915;

Cluver. Ital. p. 739.) Its ruins arc still risible,

and include the remains of a theatre and other

buildings. They are situated about 8 miles from

Macerata, and 6 from Recanati, which has preserved

the traces of the ancient name, though it does not

occupy the ancient site. (Holsten. Not. ad Cluver.

p. 137.) The Tabula correctly places it at a distance

of 12 miles from Septempeda {S. Severino.) {Tab.

Peut.)

2. A small town on the coast of Lignria, men­

tioned only in the Tabula, which places it on the

coast to the E. of Genoa. It is commonly identified

with Recco, a town about 12 miles from Genoa, but

the Tabula gives the distance as only 7, so that the

identification is very doubtful. {Tab. Pent.; Geogr.

Rav. iv. 32.) [E. H. B.]

RICINA {'PiKira, Ptol. ii. 2. § 11), one of tho

Ebudae insulac or Hebrides. [T. H. D.]

RIDUNA, one of the islands off that part of the

Gallic coast which was occupied by the Armoric

states. As the Marit. Itin. mentions Caesares

{Jertey), Sarnia {Guernsey), and Riduna, it is con­

cluded that Riduna is Aurigny or Alderney off

Cap de la Hague. [G. L.]

RIGODULUM, a place on the Mosella {Motel),

"protected either by mountains or the river."

(Tacitns, Hitt. iv. 71.) In the war with Civilis

this place was occupied by Valcntinus with a large

force of Treviri. Civilis, who was at Mainz,

marched to Rigodulum in three days (tertiis castris)

and stormed the place. On the following day be

reached Colonia Trevirorum ( Trier). It is supposed

that Rigodulum may be Reol on the Motel. Lip-

sius assumes Rigodulum to be Rigol near Con-

fluentes {Coblem), but that is impossible. Am-

mianus Marceilinus (xvi. 6) places Rigodulum near

Confluentes, but his authority is small; and there

may be some corruption in the text. [G. L.]
