1242 TUSCULUM. TUSCULUM.

Superbus, who courted the friendship of the Latin

cities, Octavius Mamilius of Tusculum was the

foremost man of all the race, tracing his descent

from Ulysses and Circe. Him Tarquin conciliated

by the gift of his daughter in marriage, and thus

obtained the powerful alliance of his family and con­

nections, (lav. i. 49; Dionys. \v. 45.) The ge­

nealogical pretensions of the pens Mamilia are still

to be seen on their coins, which bear on the

obverse the head of Mercury, and on the reverse

Ulysses in his travelling dress and with his dog.

'1'he alliance of Mamilius with Iarquin, however,

was the main cause of the Latin War. After

Ins expulsion from Rome, and unsuccessful at­

tempt to regain his crown by means of the Etrus­

cans, Tarquin took refuge with his son-in-law at

Tusculum (Liv. ii. 15), and by his assistance

formed an alliance with the confederacy of the thirty

Latin cities, (/£». 18). The confederate army took

up a position near Lake Kegillns, a small sheet of

water, now dry. which lay at the foot of the hill

on which Tusculum is seated. This was the scene

of the famous battle so fatal to the Latins, in u. c

497. Mamilius, who commanded the Latin army,

was killed by the hand of Titus Herminius; Tar-

quinins Superb us himself, who, though now ad­

vanced in years, took a part in the combat, was

wounded; and the whole Latin army sustained an

irretrievable defeat (»6. l'J. 20; Dionys. vi. 4, seq.).

Alter the peace which ensued, the Tusculans re­

mained for a long while the faithful allies of Rome;

nil attachment which drew down on their territory

the incursions of the Voisci and Aequi, n. c. 461,

460. (Liv. iii. 7: 8.) In B. c. 458, when the

Roman capitol was seized by the Sabine Appius

Herdonius, the Tusculans gave a signal proof of

their love and fidelity towards Rome. On the next

morning after the arrival of the news, a large body

of them inarched to that city and assisted the

Romans in recovering the capitol; an act for which

they received the public thanks of that people (io.

18; Dionys. x. 16); and soon afterwards, Lucius

Mamilius, the Tusculan dictator was rewarded with

the gift of Roman citizenship. (Liv. to.29.) In the

following year the Romans had an opportunity of

repaying the obligation. The Aequi had seized the

citadel of Tusculum by a nocturnal assault. At that

time, Fabius with a Roman army was encamped before

Antium; but, on hearing of the misfortune of the

Tusculans, lie immediately broke up his camp and

Hew to their assistance. The enterprise, however, was

not of such easy execution as the expulsion of Her­

donius. and several months were spent in combats in

the neighbourhood of Tusculum. At length the

Tusculans succeeded iu recapturing their citadel by

reducing the Aequi to a state of famine, whom they

dismissed after compelling them to pass unarmed

under the yoke, lint as they were flying homewards

the Roman consul overtook thein on Mount Algidus,

and slew them to a man. (/o\ 23; Dionys. x. 20.)

Iu the following year, the Aequi, under the con-

duet of Gracchus, ravaged the Labican and Tus­

culan territories, and encamped on the Algidus with

their booty. The Roman ambassadors sent to ex­

postulate with them were treated with insolence and

contempt. Then Tit. Quinctius Cincinnatus was

chosen dictator, who defeated the Aequi, and caused

them, with their commander Gracchus, to pass

iirnominiously under the yoke. (Liv. ib. 25—28.)

Algidus became the scene of a struggle between the

Romans and Aequi on two or three subsequent occa­

sions, as in B.c. 452 ar.<i 447. (ft. 31,41) 1

the latter battle the Romans sostaiwd i terww-

feat, being obliged to abandon tbsr asp tm ;*t

refuge in Tusculum. After this, »e do bi tnu

This steady friendship between Tg*xIit ti

Rome, marked for so many yean by lae sr/i*

tokens of mutual goodwill, was at ienctL n'*- -

by an occurrence which took place in a. c. J5. a

that year the Tusculans, in coniuactiai wci *

Gabudans and Labicans, accused ihe Inyfcs -->

before the Roman senate of making innai* * u-r

lands; but the senate cave no herd to tae* <*■

plaints. Next year GamHrns, alter sefesost

found that they bad taken up arms by pJi* :»

Roman senate, in order to prove how the T*oao

bad abandoned the ancient alliance. So w **

declared against Tusculum, and the eostfur: * •
