meter, several public buildings, and numerous in­

scribed sepulchres, some of which have inscriptions

in the Lycian characters. But the place and its

splendid ruins have since been minutely described

bv Sir 0. Fellows (/>wcot*. in Lffcia, p. 196, &c),

and in Texier'swork (fhscription >h VAsie Mincurt),

where the ruins are figured in 22 plates. The

theatre at Myra, says Sir Charles, is among the

largest and the best built in A.sia Minor: much of

it.s fine corridor and corniced proscenium remains.

The number of tombs cut in the rock is not large,

but they arc generally very spacious, and consist

of several chambers communicating with one another.

Their external ornaments are enriched by sculptured

statues in the rocks around ; but they are mostly

without inscriptions (see the plate of one in Sir C.

Fellows' Uiscov, facing p. 198, and numerous others

in a plate facing p. 2(H)). On the whole, the ruins

of Myra are among the most beautiful in Lycia.

MYHCIXUS (MvpKtvos, Steph. B.; MupKtvyos,

Tzctz. C7ii7.iii.9ii: Eth. MupKiVitfi), a place be­

longing to the Edoni, on the left bank of the

Strymon, which was selected by Histiaeus of Miletus

for his settlement. It offered great advantages to

settlers, as it contained an abundant supply of

timber fur shipbuilding, as well as silver mines.

(Herod, vii. 23.) Aristagoras retired to this place,

and, soon after landing, perished before some Thra-

cian town which he was besieging. (Herod v. 126;

Time, iv, 102.) Afterwards^ it had fallen into the

hands of the Edoni; but en tlh' murder of Pittacus,

chief of that people, it surrendered to Brasilia-;.

(Time. iv. 107.) The position of Myrcinus was in

the interior, to the X. of M. Pangaeus, not far

from Amphipolb. (Leake, Xorth. (j'rtrce, vol. iii.

MYK1CUS (WlvpiKovs), a town on the coast of

its situation. It is not mentioned by any other

writer. '[L. S.]

MYKI'NA (yivp'u-a : Eth. yivpivatos), one of the

Aeolian cities on the western coast of Mysla, about

-40 stadia to the south-west of (Iryneium. (Herod, i.  
149.) It is said to have Ix'en founded by one My-

rinus before the other Aeolian cities (Mela, i. 18). or

by the Amazon Mvi ina (Strab. xi. p. 505, xii. p. 373,

xiii. p. 623; Diod. iii. 54). Artaxerxes gave (iry­

neium and Myrina to Gongylus an Eretrian. who had

been banished from his native city for favouring the

interests of Persia. (Xenoph. Ildlen. iii. 1. §4.)

Myrina was a very strong place (Liv. xxxiii. 30),

though not very large, and had a good harbour.

(Seybix, p. 36; Agath. Vrwf. p. 9, ed. Bonn.) Pliny

( v. 32) mentions that it bore the surname of

Sebastopolis; while, according to Synccllns, it was

also calbd Smyrna. For some time .Myrina was

occupied by Philip of Macedonia; but the Ilomans

compelled him to evacuate it, and declared the place

fire. (Liv. /. r ; Polyb. xviii. 27.) It was twice

visited by severe earthquakes; first in the reign of

Tihe.ins (Tae. Ann. ii. 47), on which occasion it

rm*ived a remission of duties on account of the loss

•t hud sustained; and a second time in the reign of

Tiajan (Oros. vii. 12). The town was restored each

t'nin-, and continued to exist until a late period.
