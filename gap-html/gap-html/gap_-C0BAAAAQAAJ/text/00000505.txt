pcLv «f Q^f^c campaign*- In the inscrip-

ft>f 7««pr* then » a route from Castellum

^ Neaetacum, which is the tame place as

Nemetocenna. The distance from Cassel through

Bethxme to Arras is 43 II P. The distance ac­

cording to the Antonine Itin. from Cassel through

Minariacnm [Minartactm] is 55 M. P. There is

also a route from Tarucnna (Th^rouenne) of 33

M. P. to Nemetacum. There is no place where

these roads can meet except Arras. In the Greek

texts of Ptolemy (ii. 9. § 7) the capital of the

Atrebates is Origiacum ('OptytaKov); but it is

said that the Palatine MS. has Metacon, and alt the

early editions of Ptolemy have Metacam. It seems

possible, then, that Ptolcmy*s Metacum represent;*

Nemctacuin. But Ptolemy incorrectly places the

Atrebates on the Seme; lie also places part of their

territory on the sea-coast, which may be true. Ori­

giacum is supposed to be Or chits, between Toumat

and Douai. The town Nemetacum afterwards took

the name of the people Atrebates or Atrebatii, and

the name was finally corrupted into^4rros. [Atre-

HATEft,]

The traces of the Roman roads from Arras to

Therouenne and to Cambrai are said to exist. It is

also said that some remains of a temple of .Jupiter

have been discovered at Arras, on the Place du

Clottrt; and that there was a temple of Isis on the

sito of the Hdtel-Dteu. (I)'Anville, Notice, tfc.,

NEMETATAE. [Gallaecia, Vol. I. p. 933. a.]

NEME'TES (Stfivrcu). This name first appears

in Caesar (B. G. i. 51), who speaks of the Nemetes

as one of the Germanic tribes in the army of Ario-

vistus. In another passage (fl. G. vi. 25) he de­

scribes the Hercynia Silva as commencing on the

west at the borders of the Htrretii, the Nemctes,

and the Rauraci; and as he does not mention the

Nemetes as one of the nations on the left hank of

the Rhine (JS. G. iv. 10), wo may probably infer

that in his time they were on the cast or German

side of the Rhine, The Vangioues and Nemetes

were afterwards transplanted to the west side of the

Rhine. (Tac. Germ. c. 28.) Ptolemy makes No-.

viomagus (Speyer) the capital of the Nemptcs, but

he incorrectly places them north of the Vangiones.

whose capital was Borbetomagus (Worms). Pliny

(iv. 17) mentions the Nemetes, Tribocci. and Van­

giones in this order; but Tacitus mentions them

just in the inverse order, Vangiones, Tribocci and

Nemetes. From none of these writers could we

determine the relative positions of these peoples;

but the fact that Noviomagns (NoirVtryos) is men­

tioned by Ptolemy as the chief town of the Nemetes,

and that Noviomagns is proved to be Speyer by the

Itinerant along the west hank of the Rhine, deter­

mine the position of the Nemetes.

In Ammiamw Marccllinus (xt. 11) and the

Not. Imp., Noviomagus appears under the name

of the people Nemetes or Neinetae. Ammianus

calls it a mnnicipium, by which he probably means

a Roman town. In the Notitia of the Gallic pro­

vinces, Civitaa Nemetum belongs to Germania Prima.

In some later writings the expression occurs *' civitaa

Nemetum id est Spira." The name of Speyer is

from the Speycrbach, which flows into the Rhine at

Speyer. (D'Anville. Notice, <fc.; Walckenaer, Geog.
