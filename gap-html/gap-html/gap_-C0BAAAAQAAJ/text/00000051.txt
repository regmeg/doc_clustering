IL1THYIA (EiA«ft><oi TiJAit, Strab. xviii. p.

817; VXrieviaj, PtoL iv. 5. § 73), a town of the

Egyptian Heptanomis, 30 miles NE. of Apollinopolis

Magna. It was situated on the eastern bank of the

Xile, in lat. 25° 3' N. According to Plutarch (7m

et Otir. c. 73), Ilithyia contained a temple dedicated

t-> Bubastis, to whom, as to the Taurian Artemis,

human victims were, even at a comparatively recent

period, sacrificed. A bas-relief (Minutoi, p. 394,

seq.) discovered in the temple of Bnbastis at El-

Kah. representing such a sacrifice, seems to confirm

Plutarch's statement The practice of human sacri­

fice among the Aegyptians is, indeed, called in ques­

tion by Herodotus (ii. 45); yet that it once prevailed

among them is rendered probable by Manetho's state­

ment of a king named Amosis having abolished the

custom ,and substituted a waxen image for the human

victim. (Porphyr. de Abstinent, ii. p. 223; Euscb.

Praep. Evatu). iv. 16; comp. Ovid, Fast. v. 621.)

Tbe singularity in Plutarch's story is the recent

date of the imputed sacrifices. [ \V. B. D.j

ILITURGIS. [Iluturgis.]

IT.IUM, I'LIOS ("IAioi', i'lMos: Eth. 'IAniii,

f. lAiai), sometimes also called Tkoja (Toofa),

whence the inhabitants are commonly called Tpuss,

and in the Latin writers Trojani. The existence of

this city, to which we commonly give the name of

Troy, cannot be doubted any more than the simple

fact of tbe Trojan War, which was believed to have

ended with the capture and destruction of the city,

after a war of ten years, B. c. 1184. Troy was the

principal city of tbe country called Trims. As the

city has been the subject of curious inquiry, both in

•Baent and modem times, it will be necessary, in the

Sot instance, to collect and analyse the statements

ft the ancient writers ; and to follow up this discus-

roun.

sion by an account of the investigations of modern

travellers and scholars to identify the site of the

famous city. Our most ancient authority are the

Homeric poems; but we must at the very outset

remark, that we cannot louk upon the poet in every

respect as a careful and accurate topographer; but

that, admitting his general accuracy, there may yet

be points on which he cannot be taken to account as

if it had been his professed object to communicate

information on the topography of Troy.

The city of Ilium was situated on a rising ground,

somewhat above the plain between the rivers Sca-

mander and Simois, at a distance, as Strabo asserts,

of 42 stadia from {he coast of the Hellespont (Horn.

II. xx. 216, fol.; Strab. xiii. p. 596.) Thut it was

not qnite in the plain is clear from the epithets

i\vtp6*aaa, alirtivri, and vrppvntrraa. Behiud it, on

the south-east, there rose a hill, forming a branch of

Mount Ida, surmounted by tile acropolis, called Per-

gamum (to Tlipyapoy, Horn. II. iv. 508, vi. 512;

also to; nipyapa. Soph. Phil 347, 353, 611; or,

i] nipyapos, Horn. 77. v. 446, 460.) This fortified

acropolis contained not only all the temples of the

gods (7£ iv. 508, v. 447,512, vi. 88,257, xxii. 172,

Sec.), but also the palaces of Priam and his sons,

Hector and Paris {II. vi. 317, 370, 512, vii. 345).

The city must have had many gates, as may he in­

ferred from the expression iraaai irvAai (77. ii. 809,

and elsewhere), but only one is mentioned by name,

viz., the 2K<uai wi/Acu, which led to the camp of the

Greeks, and must accordingly have been on the north­

west part of the city, that is, the part just opposite the

acropolis (7/. iii. 145, 149, 263, vi. 306, 392, xvi.

712, &c). The origin of this name of the "left gate"

is unknown, though it may possibly have reference to

the manner in which the signs in the heavens were

observed ; for, during this process, the priest turned

his face to the north, so that the north-west would

be on his left hand. Certain minor objects alluded

to in the Iliad, such as the tombs of Ilus, Aesyetes,

and Myrine, the Scopie and Erineus, or tbe wild

fig-tree, we ought probably not attempt to urge

very strongly : we are, in fact, prevented from at­

tributing much weight to them by the circumstance

that the inhabitants of New Ilium, who believed that

their town stood on the site of the ancient city, boasted

that they could show close to their walls these doubt­

ful vestiges of antiquity. (Strab. xiii. p. 599.) The

walls of Ilium are described as lofty and strong, and

as flanked with towers; they were fabled to have

been built by Apollo and Poseidon (72. i. 129, ii.

113, 288, iii. 153, 384,386, vii. 452, viii. 519).

These are the only points of the topography of Ilium

derivable from the Homeric poems. The city was de­

stroyed, according to the common tradition, as already

remarked, about b. c. 1184; but afterwards we hear

of a new Ilium, though we are not informed when

and on what site it was built Herodotus (vii. 42)

relates that Xerxes, before invading Greece, offered

sacrifices to Athena at Pergamum, the ancient acro­

polis of Priam; but this does not quite justify the

inference that the new town of Ilium was then

already in existence, and all that we can conclude

from this passage is, that the people at that time

entertained no doubt as to the sites of the ancient city

and its acropolis. Strabo (xiii. p. 601) states that

Ilium was restored during the last dynasty of the

Lydian kings; that is, before the subjugation of

Western Asia by the Persians: and both Xenophon

(Hilltn. i. 1. § 4) and Scylax (p. 35) seem to speak

of Ilium as a town actually existing in their days.
