VILLA FAUSTINL a place of the Iceni in Bri­

tannia Komana, on the road from Londininm to the

northern boundary wall. (Ittn. Ant. p. 474.) Cam­

den (p. 438) identifies it with St. Edmund's Bury;

but others have placed it near Thetford, at Wulpit,

and at Tornham Parra. [T. H. D.]

VIMINA'OIUM {Qiinivamov, Ptol. iii. 9. § 3),

an important town of Moesia Superior, lying some­

what E. of the mouth of the Margus, and connected

with Constantinople by a highroad which passed

through Naissus. (Itin. Ant. p. 133; It'm. Jlkro-

sol. p. 564.) It was the head-quarters of the Legio

vn. Claudia. (/&.; cf. Eutrop. ix. 13 ; l'rocop. de

Aal. iv. G. p. 287; TheophyL i. 5, viii. 12, Sec)

By the later Greeks the name is written BifuvdKiov.

Variously identified w ith Ram or Rama, and Kosto-

lacz. (Cf. Marsili, Danub. ii. p. 10; Mannert, vii.

p. 78.) [T. H. D.]

VIMINA'CIUM (Ov^tvdKiov, Ptol. ii. 6. § 50),

a town of the Vaccaei in Hispania Tarracomnsis,

to the E. of Pallaneia. ([tin. Ant. pp. 449, 453.)

Identified with Valderaducilor Beceril. [T. H. D.j

VINCEIA, a town of Moesia Superior, between

Mons Aureus and Margum, and 6 miles from the

former. (Itin. Ant. p. 132) In the Win. Iliero-

ttoL (p. 504) it is called Vingeius or Vingeium.

La pie identities it with Sanendria. [T. II. D.]

VINCUM. [Bingium.]

ViNDA (OvtvSla, Ptol. v. 4. §7), a place in

Galatia, between Pes^inus and Ancyra, near the

modern Ilidja. (It. Ant. pp. 201,202.) [L. S.]

VINDALUM, or VINDALIUM (OvlvhaXov), in

Gallia Narbonensis, a place where Domitius Aheno-

barbus defeated the AUobroges, B. c. 121. [Gallia

Transalpine, Vol. I. p. 954.] Strabo (iv. p. 185)

hays that Vindalnm is at the confluence of the Sul-

gas [Scloas] and the Rhone. Florus (iii. 2)

names this river Vindalicus or Vindelicus. The

Sulgas is the Sorgue. D'Anville, relying, as he

often does, on a mere resemblance of name, would

place Vindalium at I Went', which is aboutamile from

the junction of the Sorgue and the Rhone. Others

would place Vindalium at Port de la Traille, the

place where the Sorgue joins the Rhone. [G. L.]

VIN DANA POKTUS (Ovtvtiava Ai^r/r), a bay

on the north-west coast of Gallia (Ptol. ii.8. §1), and

placed by Ptolemy between the mouth of the Herius

[Hekh s] and the Proinontorium G'baeum. D'An­

ville supposes the Vindana to be the bay of Morbi-

han, at the bottom uf which was the capital of the

Veneti, now Vannes. Other geographers have made

other guesses: the bay of bouarncz, the mouth of

the Biuret, and others still. [G. L.]

VINDELEIA (OutfSfAfta, Ptol. ii. 6. § 53), a

town of the Autrigones in Hispania Tarraconensis,

between Virovesca and Deobriga. (Jtin. Ant. p. 454.)

Probably Pancorbo. [T. H. D.]

VINDEU'CIA (OvivhtXitia or BifSeAKi'a), the

most western of the four Danubian provinces of the

Roman empire. In the time of Augustus, it formed

a distinct province by itself, but towards the end of

the first century after Christ it was united with

Jtbaetia. At a .still later period the two countries

were again separated, and liliaetia Proper appears

under tho name Khaetia Prima, and Vindelicia

under that of Rhaetia Secunda. We have here to

speak only of the latter or Vindelicia, as it appears

in the time of Augustus, when it was botxli^ *

the north by Germania Magta, that U. U tts

Danube and the Vallum Hadnani or Licei, a

west by the territory of the Heiretii. on the wl2

by Khaetia, and on the east by Xor^ur, tsa

which it was separated by the river Orra t/wt

The line of demarcation between Vir^U-*

Khaetia is not mentioned anywhere, hot wis b i~

probability formed by the ridce of tbe KL»*u2

Alps. Vindelicia accordingly embraced tbe &ri-

eastern parts of Switzerland, the south-earm tci

of Badt-n, the southern part of WaTtrz.l^ cJ

Bavaria, and the northern fart of Tirvl
