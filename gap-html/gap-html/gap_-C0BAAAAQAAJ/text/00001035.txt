to one reading, but accord-

ing to another reading, a city of the Massnliots,

"from which comes the ethnic name Sequani, as

Artemidorus says in his first book.". Nothing can

be made of this fragment further than this; the

name Sequanos belonged both to the basin of the

Rhone and of the Seme. [G. L.]

SECOR or SICOR (Sijirip *- 2nto> Ktufr), a

port which Ptolemy (ii. 7. § 2) places on the west

coast of Gallia, between the Pectonium or Pictonium

Promontorium and the mouth of the Ligeris (Ijoire).

The name also occurs in Marcianus. The latitudes

of Ptolemy cannot be trusted, and we have no other

means of fixing the place except by a guess. Ac?

cordingly D'Anville supposes that Secor may be the

port of the Sublet dOUmne; and other conjectures

have been made. [G. L.]

SECURISCA (ScKoupio-Ka, Procop. de Aed. iv.

7. p. 292, ed. Bonn.), a town in Moesia Inferior,

lying S. of the Danube, between Oescus and Novae,

(/(in. Ant. p. 221; comp. Geogr. Rav. iv. 7; Theo-

phyl. vii. 2.) Variously identified with Sohegurli,

Sittov, and Tcherezelan. [T. H. D.]

SEDELAUCUS. [Sidolocus.]

SEDETA'NI. [Edetani.]

SEDIBONIA'TES, are placed by Pliny in Aqni-

tania (iv. c. 19). lie says, "Aquitani, unde nomen

provinciae, Sediboniatcs. Mox in oppidum contri-

buti Convenae, Begerri." The Begerri are the Bi-

gerriones of Caesar. [Bigerriones.] We have no

means of judging of the position of the Sediboniates

except from what Pliny says, who seems to place

them near the Bigerriones and Convenae. [Con-

venae.] [G. L.]

SEDU'NI, a people in the valley of the Upper

Rhone, whom Caesar (B. G. iii. 1, 7) mentions:

"Nantuates Sedunos Veragrosque." They are also

mentioned in the trophy of the Alps (Plin. iii. 20)

in the same order. They are east of the Veragri,

and in the Valait. Their chief town had the same

name as the people. The French call it Sum, and

the Germans name it Sitten, which is the ancient

name, for it was called Sedunum in the middle

ages. An inscription has been found at Sion:

"Civitas Sedunorum Patrono." Sitten is on the

right bank of the Rhone, and crossed by a stream

called Sionne. The town-hall is said to contain

several Roman inscriptions. [Nantuates; Octo-

durus.] [G. L.]

SEDU'SII, a German tribe mentioned by Caesar

(B. 0,1. 51) as serving under Ariovistus; but as no

particulars are stated about them, and as they are not

spoken of by any subsequent writer, it is impossible

to say to what part of Germany they Monped,

Some regard them as the same as the Edusones

mentioned by Tacitus (Germ. 40), and others iden­

tify them with the Phundusi whom Ptolemy (ii.

11. § 12) places in the Cimbrian Chersonesus;

but both conjectures are mere fancies, based on

nothing hut a faint resemblance of names. [L. S.]

SEGALLAUNI (SryoAAavroi, Ptol. ii. 10. § 11).

Ptolemy places them west of the Allobroges, and he

names as their town Valentia Colonia ( Valence), near

the Rhone. Pliny (iii. 4) names them Segovellauni,

and places them between the Vocontii ami the

Allobroges; but he makes Valentia a town of the

Carares. [Cavares.] [G. L.]

SEGASA.MUNCLUM (Ityuraa&yitovXov, Ptol.

ii. 6. § 53), a town of the Autrigones in Hispania

Tarraconensis. (/tin Ant. p. 394.) Variously

identified with S. Maria de Ribaredonda, Cameno.
