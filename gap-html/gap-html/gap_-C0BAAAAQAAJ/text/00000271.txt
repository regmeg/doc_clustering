MAGNUM PBOMONTORIUM. 2..S MAKKEDAH.

decay at an early period, as it is uot mentioned

by any Ute writer. Appian \(Mithrid. 78, 115)

speaks of it under both names, Eupatoria and Mag-

nofr4is, and Strabo in one passage (xii. p. 560)

(peaks of it under the name of Megalopolis. Ruins

of the place are said to exist some miles to the west

of Somisa, at a place called licghaz Ilissan Kaleh.

(Hamilton, Researches, i. p. 340.) [L. S.]

MAGNUM PBOMONTORIUM (to firva axpu-

rtipiov, PtoL Tii. 2. § 7; Marciin, Veripl. p. 28), a

promontory which forms the utbern termination

of the Chersonesus Aurea, in India extra Gaiigem,

on the western side of the Sinus .Magnus. Its

modem name is C. Romania. Some have supposed

that the Prom. Magn. represents another cape,

either considerably to the NW., now called C. Pa-

taaa. Ptolemy's account of these far Eastern places

is ao doubtful, that it is impossible to feel sure of

the evidence for or against the position of any place

ia the Anrea Chersonesus. [^r-]

MAGNUM PKOMONTORIUM, a promontory on

the vest coast ofLusitania(Mela, iii. 1. § 6), probably

the same which Strabo (iii. p. 151) and Ptolemy

ii 5. § 1) call to BapGdpiov tiucpov, near the mouth of

the Tagus. The passage in Strabo is corrupt; but

according to the correction of Coray, approved of by

Gnokurd, the promontory was 210 stadia from the

mouth of the Tagus, which makes ii correspond with

C Espichtl. Pliny also calls it Magnum or Olisi-

panense. from the town inits vicinity; but he strangely

corjjunds it with the Prom. Artabrum, on the NW.

of the peninsula (iv. 21.8. 35).

MAGNUM PROM. MAURETANIAE. [Mau-

bxtasiaT

MAGNUS PORTUS. 1. (TOproi niyvos, Ptol.

ii. 4. § 7 ; comp. Marcian. p. 41), a port-town of

Hispania Baetica, between the tovra Abdara and the

Prom. Charid»»mL

2. (Mt'-yas Xi/ifr, Ptol. ii. 6. § 4), a bay on the

coast of the G dlaeei Lucernes, which is evidently the

aazne as the Artabrorum Sinus. [Vol. I. p. 226, b.]

3. (MfToj Xifctiv, Ptol. ii. 3. §§ 4, 33), a har-

Boax in Britain, opposite the island of Vectis, corre-

•ponds to Portsmouth.

A. (n<iproi Mottoi, Ptol. iv. 2. § 2; Mela, i. 5;

Plan, t. 2; It. Anton, p. 13), a port-town of Mau­

ritania Caesariensis, on the road between Gilva and

QahoL, described by Pliny as "eivium Romanorum

«ppidam." It is identitied by Korbiger with Oran,

of which the harbour is still called Mars-eUKibir,

L e_ the great Harbour.

5. (Mtyoi tep'tir, PtoL iv. 6. § 6), a port on the

•eat coast of Libya Interior, between the mouth of the

river Daradus and the promontory Rvssadium.

MAGNUS SINUS (o aryat k6\itos, Ptol. vii.

4. §§ 3, 5; Agalbein. i. p. 53), the great gulf

which runs up to the middle of the present king­

dom of Ava, and ia known by the name of the

G*lf of SiatA. The ancient geographers correctly

placed China on the east of this gulf, though they

Bad no very accurate notions relative to its latitude

«r longitude. On the west side was the Auvca

Chersonesus. [V.]

MAGO. [Baleaues, p. 374, a.]

MAGON (o Mxyaiv, Arrian, Jnd. c. 4), n river

rae5t.uced by Arruin as flowing into the Ganges on

it* left bank. It has been conjectured that it is the

■me as the present Ramgvua. [V.]

MAGONTIACUM. [Mooantiacum.]

MAGORAS, a river of Syria, under mount Li-

Uui, mentioned by Pliny (v. 20) apparently be-

tween Sidon and Berytus, and probably identical

with the Tamyras of Strabo (xvi. p. 756), now

Kalir-ed-Damur; though Dr. Robinson suggests the

Nahr-Beirbt. {Bib. lies. vol. iii. pp. 433, 439.)

[Tamyras.] [G. W.]

MAGORUM SINUS (Ma-viV koawos), a bay on

the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf, in the country

of the Themi, who joined the Gerraei on the north.

(Ptol. vi. 7. § 54.) It is still marked by the

modern town of Mugas, and the ancient name is

accounted for by Mr. Forster by the fact that "the

ancient Themi are the Magian tribe of Beni-Temin,

in all ages of Arabian history inhabitants of the

gulf and city of Mayas,—a deep bay, with its chief

town of the same name, immediately above the bay

of Katijf." (Geogr. of Arabia, vol. ii. p. 215.) lie

maintains that the Magi of S. Matthew (ii. 1) were

of this tribe, and from this country (vol. i. pp.

304—307). [Themi.] [G.W.]

MAGRADA, a small river on the N. coast of

Hispania Tarraconensis, now Uresmea. (Mela, iii.

1. § 10.)

MAGYDUS (MdTuoos: Eth. MayvotHs; called

MootjSoj by Scylax, p. 39), a town of Pam-

phylia, on the coast between Attaleia and Perge,

and subsequently of episcopal rank, is probably the

Mvgdale (Mt/>SaA7|), of the Stadiasmus. There

are numerous imperial coins of Magydus, bearing the

epigraph MAITAEflN. Leake identities it with

Laara, (Ptol. v. 5. § 2; Hierocl. p. 679; Sta-

diasm. §§ 201, 202; Leake, Asia Minor, p. 194;

Cramer, Asia Minor, vol. ii. p. 278.)

■ MAHANA1M (Mayatu, LXX.), a place, and

afterwards a town, on the east side of the Jordan,

so named from the incident related in Genesis (xxx ii.

2), where the word is translated, both by the LXX.

and Josephus, TlaptfxGoAai, and also by the latter

8eoD arparonebov {Ant. i. 20. § 1). The following

notices of its position occur in the Old Testament; —

It was north of the brook Jabbok (Gen, /. c, comp. v.

22), in the borders of Bashan {Josh. xiii. 30), after­

wards in the tribe of Gad (xxi. 38), but on the con­

fines of the half-tribe of Manasseh (xiii. 29) as­

signed to the Levites. (1 Chron. vi. 80.) It was

the seat of Lshbosheth's kingdom, during the time

that David reigned in Hebron (2 Sam. ii.), and there

he was assassinated (iv.). When David fled from

Absalom, he was maintained at Mahanaim by Bar*

zillai, the aged sheikh of that district (2 Sam. xvii.

27, xix. 32); and it was apparently in the vicinity

of this city that the decisive battle was fought in

the wood of Ephraim between the royal troops and

the rebels (xviii). A ruined site is mentioned in

the Jebel 'Ajlun, under the name of Mahneli, which

probably marks the position of Mahanaim. (Robin­

son, Bib. Res. vol. iii. Appendix, p. 166.) [G.W.]

MAIS, a station in Britain, so called upon an

engraved bronze cup found at Rudge, in Wiltshire.

Prom this name occurring with those of four other

stations, all on the line of the Great Wall, it is supposed

to be identical with Magna, or Magnis. [C. R. S.]

MAIS (Mats), a river of India intra Gangem,

flowing into the Sinus Barygnzcnus, now the Mahi.

(Xearch. p. 24 ; Arrian, Ptriplus Maris Eryth-

raei.)

MAKKEDAH (Ma/rnSa, LXX.,Euseb.; MaKxioa,

Joseph.), a city of the Canaanitcs in the south part

of the tribe of Judah (Josh. xv. 41), governed by a

sheikh. It was the first city taken by Joshua at'ter

the battle ia Gibeon; and there it was that the live

confederate kings were found hid in a cave, which
