divides into two branches at the head of the Bata­

vorum Insula. The branch which Hows along the

German bank keeps its name and its rapid course to

the Ocean. The branch which flows on the Gallic

hank is broader and less rapid: this is the Vahalis

{Waal), which Hows into the Mosa. (Hist v. 23.)

[BATAVom'M I.Nsri.A.] He knows only two out­

lets of the Rhine, and one of them is through tlie

Mosa. The Rhine, as he calls the eastern branch,

is the boundary between Gallia and Germania. East

of this eastern branch he places the Frtsii (/Inn.

iv. 72); and herein he agrees with Pliny, who

places them between the Middle Hhine and the

Klevum. Accordingly the Khenus of Tacitus is

the Khenus of Mela and Pliny.

This third branch ot the Rhine seems to he that

■which Tacitus calls the work of Drusus (Ann. ii.

ti), and which Seutonius (Claudius, c. 1) mentions

without saying where it was: '"Drusus trans Rhenum

fossas novi et immensi operis ef fecit, quae nunc adhuc

Drusinae vocantur." Gcnnanicus in his expedition

againsl the northern Germans (Tac. Ann, ii. 6), or­

dered his fleet to assemble at the Batavorum Insula,

whence it sailed through the Fossa Drusiana, and

the lakes into the Ocean and to the river Ami.-ia

(£"//«). This course was probably taken to avoid

the navigation alone; the sea-coast of Holland. On

a former occasion Gcnnanicus had taken the same

course (Ann. i. 60), and his father Drusus had

done the ?-ame.

Ptolemy (ii. 0. § 4), who wrote after Tacitus and

Pliny, is acquainted with three outlets of the Rhine,

lie places first the outlet of the Mosa in 24° 40'

long., 53° 20' lat. He then comes to the Batavi

and to Lngdunum, which town he places in 2t»° 30'

long., 53° 20' lat. The western mouth of the Rhine

is in 2tiJ 4.'/ Ion?.. 5.'»° 20' lat. The mid.He mouth

is in 27° long.,53°30' lat.; and the eastern in 28°

long., 54° lat. His absolute numbers are incorrect,

and they may be relatively incorrect also. His

western outlet is a little ea-t of Lugdunum, and

this should he the Old Rhine or Rhine Proi>er.

The middle month i^ further east, and the eastern

mi.mil further east still. The eastern mouth may

be the }>>■•/ but it is difficult to say what Ptolemy's

middle mouth is. Gospel in supines that Ptolemy's

western mouth may have been about Zawiwoord.

II'- further supposes that the Middle Mouth ac-

cording to Ins measures was about the latitude of

linkkum, about 4 leagues above Zandwoord, and

he adds that this mouth was not known to those

writers who preceded Ptolemy, and we may con­

jecture that it was little used, and was the first

of the cutlets that ceased to be navigable. '1 he

third mouth he supposes to correspond to the, pa:*-

sage of the Vlie. But nothing can be more vague

and unsatisfactory than this explanation, founded

on Ptolemy's measurements and pure conjecture.

Si much as this is plain. Ptolemy does not reckon

the Mosa as one of the outlets of the Rhine, as the

Roman writers do; and he makes three outlets be­

sides the outlet of the Mosa.

This country of swamps,rivers, and forests through

which the Lower Rhine flowed has certainly under­

gone great changes since the Roman period, owing

to the Moods of the Rhine and the inundations of

the sea. and it is very difficult, perhaps impossible,

to tnako the ancient descriptions agree with the

modem localities. Still it was a fixed opinion that

the Rhine divided into two great brandies, as Caesar

says, and this was the division of the Rhine from

the Waal at Panwrdrn.. or wlifTfrer it trxr

been in former times. One of the creat rct*i

that w hich we call the Moot that fl.m b*Ji

dam: the other was the Rhine Proper tin*. e:.ia

sea near Leidm, and it was the strwri mm

nrrrten to Ltidtn that formed the boan-iw" k

Gallia and Germania. (Servian, ad ,4'vid

727.) Ptolemy places all his three net A- a

lia, and it is the eastern mouth «hi;h bt I

the boundary between Roman Gall'u uiiG~al

mania (ii. 11. § 1). If his eastern a#si

»«'-/, he makes this river from Anim \

outlet of the Yssel the eastern limit <i I

Gallia in his time. This may be so, bit i

not so that Pliny and Tacitus understood to

darj. Whatever chances may lave tjks

The Romans began these works. In tu t
