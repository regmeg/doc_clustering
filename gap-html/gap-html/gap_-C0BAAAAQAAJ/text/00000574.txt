4SS OKCHOMENUS. OBCHO.MENTS.

tin1 whole of Northern Boeotia; ami that even Thebes

was for a time compelled to pay tribute to Erginus,

kililt of Orehomenus. From this tribute, however,

the Thebans were delivered by Hercules, who made

war upon Orehomenus, and gre.illy reduced its

power. (l'an>.ix. 37. § 2; Strab. ix. p. 414; Diod.

iv 18.) In the Homeric catalogue Orehomenus is

mentioned along with Aspledon, but distinct from

the other Bix'otian towns, uiid as sending 30 .ships

to the Trojan War (//. ii. 511). Sixty years after

the Tro an War, according to the received chronology,

the sovereignty of the Minyae seems to have been

overthrown by the Boeotian immigrants from

Thessaly; and Orehomenus became a member of the

B"eotian confederacy. (Strab. ix. p. 401; cornp.

Time. i. 12.) The city now ceased to !>«• the Minyeian

and became the Boeotian Orehomenus (Time. iv. 7*>);

hut it still remained a powerful state, and throughout

the whole historical period was second only to Thebes

in the Boeotian confederacy. The town of Chaeroneia

appears to have been always one of its dependencies.

(Time. iv. 7(1.) In the Persian War Orehomenus,

together with the other Boeotian towns, with the

exception of Thespiae and Plataeac, deserted the

cause of Grecian independence. Orehomenus pos­

sessed an aristocrat ienl government, and continued

on friendly terms with Thebes, as long as the aristo­

crat ical party in the latter city had tlie direction of

public affairs. But when, after the close of the

Peloponnesian War. a revolution placed the govern­

ment of Thebes in the hands of the democracy, Or­

ehomenus became op[>osed to Thebes. Accordingly,

when war broke out between Sparta and Thebes, and

Lysander invaded Boeotia in it. <_'. 395, Orehomenus

revolted from Thebes, and sent troops to assist Ly-

sandcr in Ins siege of Haliartus (Plut. Lys. 28; Xen.

Hell iii. 5. § C, seq.; Diod. xiv. 81; Com. N'ej/is.

Lys. 3.) In the following year (u. c. 394). when all

tlie other Boeotians joined the Tliebans and Athenians

at the battle of Coroneia, tlie Orchomenians fought

in the army of Agesilaus, who arrayed them against

the Thebans. (Xen. //til. iv. 3. § 15, Ayes. 2. § 9.)

It was now the object of the Spartans to deprive

Thebes of her supremacy over the Boeotian cities.

This they effected by the peace of Autalcidas, it.<•.

387, by winch Thebes was obliged to acknowledge

the independence of Orehomenus and of the cities of

Boeotia. (Xen. Hell. v. ]. § 31.) The battle of

Lenctra (n. c. 371) changed the position of affairs,

and made Thebes the undisputed master of Boeotia.

Orehomenus was now at the mercy of the Thebans,

who were anxious to destroy the city, and reduce the

inhabitants to slavery. Kpaininondas, however, dis­

suaded them from carrying their wishes into effect,

and induced them to pardon Orehomenus, and re­

admit it as a member of tin: Boeotian confederation.

(I)iod. xv. 57.) The Thebans appear to have yielded

with reluctance to the generous advice of Epami-

noiulas; and they took advantage of his absence in

Thessaly, in it.<*. 368, to carry their original design

into effect. The pretext was that the 300 knights

at Orehomenus had entered into a conspiracy with

some Theban exiles to overthrow the democratical

constitution of Thebes. It is not improbable that

tlie whole story was a fiction; but tlie Thebans eagerly

listened to the accusation, condemned the 300 Or-

chomenians, and decreed that the city should be

destroyed. A Theban army was immediately sent

against it, which burnt it to the ground, put all the

male inhabitants to the sword, ami sold all the women

and children into slavery. (Diod. XV. 79; 1'uus. ix.

15. § 3.) This atrocious act of ren^nce ptm-*4

as an indelible stigma upon the TUbaa ciiiTt^a

(Dem. c. Leptin. p. 490.)

Orehomenus remained a long time in raiti*. t>*ijs

the Athenians were anxious fur its restoration, ix

the purpose of humbling Thebes. (iMri. J/.?a

pp. 203, 208.) It appears to have bw-n rmii

during the Phocian War, when the Pboaua a-

dcavoured to expel the Thebans from tbfiwr'.bn

parts of Boeotia, In B.C. 353 we find tlie iV-ui

leader Onomarchus in jtossession of OniioutDi^ ad

Coroneia (Diod. xvi. 33, 35); and in the Ufe<*o(

year I'hayllus was defeated in the netgbbourt^tl 4

these towns. (Diod. xvi. 37.) On.iiotr.enit, On

neia, and Corsiae were the three fortified jJiosi

Boeotia, which the Phocians had in their p-i

(Diod. xvi. 58); and from which they niaJ? ii»

On the conclusion of the Sacred War, H'-MI

Orehomenus was given by Philip to its lm\^*cA

stroyed the city a second time, and sold ail it* mfc

bitants as slaves. (Aesch. <U FaU, Lty. p. 30

Dem. Phil ii. p. 69, de Pact, p. 62, de FaL*.U

Orehomenus was famous for the worship of
