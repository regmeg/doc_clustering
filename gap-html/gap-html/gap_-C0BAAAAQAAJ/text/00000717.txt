PISA (nib-a: Etk. Uicirnt, riurauvt), a town

in Peloponnesus, was in the most ancient times the

capital of an independent district, called Pisatis

(i) riio-am), which subsequently formed part of the

territory of Elis. It was celebrated in mythology

as the residence of Oenomaus and Pelops, and was

the head of a confederacy of eight states, of which,

besides Pisa, the following names are recorded: —

Salmone, Heracleia, llarpinna, Cycebium, and Dys-

pontium. (Strub. viii. p. 356, seq.) Pisa had ori­

ginally the presidency of the Olympic festival, but

was deprived of this privilege by the Eleians. The

Pisatans, however, made many attempts to recover

it; and the history of their wars with the-Eleians,

which were at last terminated by the destruction of

Pisa in B. c 572, is narrated elsewhere. [Ki.is,

VoL I. p. 818, b.] Although Pisa ceased to exist

as a city from this time, the Pisatans, in conjunc­

tion with the Arcadluns, celebrated the 104th

Olympic festivid, u. c. 364. [See Vol. I, p. 819, b.]

Pisa was said to have been founded by an epony­

mous hero, Pibus, the son of Pcrieres, and grandson

of Aeolus (Paus. vi. 22. § 2); but others derived

its name from a fountain Pisa, (Strab. viii. p. 356;

Eustath. ad Dionyt. Ptr. 409.) Modem writers

connect its name with lliaos. a low marshy ground,

or with niooa, the name of the black fir or pine-

tree. So completely was Pi.-a destroyed by the

Eleians, that the fact of its having existed was a

disputed point in the time of Strabo (/. c); and

Pausanias found its site converted into a vineyard

(vi. 22. § 1). Its situation, however, was perfectly

well known to Pindar and Herodotus. Pindar fre­

quently identifies it with Olyinpia (c. g. 01. ii. 3);

and Herodotus refers to Pisa and Olvnipia as tlie

same point in computing the distance from the altar

of the twelve gods at Athens (ii. 7). I'i-a appears

from Pausanias to have occupied a portion between

Harpinna and Olympia, which were only 20 stadia

asunder (Lucian, oV Mort. l'eregr. 35); and the

Scholiast on Pindar (01. xi. 51) says that Pita was

only 6 stadia from Olyiniiiu. It must therefore be
