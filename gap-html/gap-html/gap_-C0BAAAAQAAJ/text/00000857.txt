IV urapKst allowing no alteration except a slight

eni of in height. (Tat Eitt. iv. 53; Suet

ceip.8; Dion Cass.Ixvi. 10, &c.) The new build­

ing, however, stood but for a very short period. It

was again destroyed soon after Vespasian's death

in a great fire which particularly desolated the

9th Region, and was rebuilt bj Domitian with a

splendour hitherto unequalled. (Suet. Dom. 15;

Dion Cass. Ixvi. 24.) Nothing further is accurately

known of its history; but Domitian's structure

seems to have lasted till a very late period of the

Empire.

the Trasimene lake and were consecrated two years

afterwards by Q. Fabius Maximus and T. Otacilius

Crassus. (Liv. xxii. 10, xxiii. 51; Cic. A'. /'- ii.

23.) A temple of Venus Cafitolina and Venus

Victrix are also mentioned, but it is not clear

whether they were separate edifices. (Suet. Cai. 7,

Galb. 18; Fiut. Amit. Fill. Id. Oct.) We also hear

of two temples of Jupiteb (Liv. xxxv. 41), and a

temple of Ops (xxxix. 22). It by no means follows,

however, that all these temples were on the Capitol,

properly so called, and some of them might have

been on the other BUmmit, Capitolium being used

generally as the name of the hill. This seems to

have been the case with the temple of Fortune,

respecting which we have already cited an ancient

inscription when discussing the site of the temples

of Concord and Jupiter Tonans. It is perhaps the

temple of Fortuna Primigenia mentioned by Plutarch

(Fori. Rom. 10) as having been bnilt by Servius on

the Capitoline, and alluded to apparently by Clemens.

(ProtrtpL iv. St. p. 15. Sylb.) The temple of

Honos and Virtus, built by C. Marine, certainly

could not have been on the northern eminence, since

wc learn from Festus (p. 34, Mull.) that he was

compelled to build it low lest it should interfere with

the prospect of the augurs, and he should thus be

ordered to demolish it. Indeed Properties (iv. 11.

45) mentions it as being on the Tarpeian rock, or

southern summit: —

"Foedaque Tarpeio conopia tendere saxo

Jura dare et statuas inter ct arma Man."

Whence we discover another indication that the

augnraculum could not possibly have been on the

NE. height; for in that case, with the huge temple

of Jupiter befure it, there would have been little

cause to quarrel with this bagatelle erected by Ma-

rius. It must hare stood on a lower point of the
