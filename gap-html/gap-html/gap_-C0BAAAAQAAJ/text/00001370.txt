128G VIA A EMILIA. VETUBIL

Beg. ii. 56). But till very recently the opinion

most commonly adopted was that of Leandro Alberti,

an antiquary of the 16th centary, who placed it on

Monte Calvi (Descriz. if ft alt a. p. 27), in a wood

called Select di Vetleta; and who has been followed

by Cluverius (Ital. Ant. ii. 2. p. 472), by Miiller

(Etrwker, i. p. 211), &c. It is now, however,

generally admitted that Vetulonia is to be identified

with the remains of a city, discovered in 1842 by

Sig. Pasquinelli, an Italian engineer, »t Magliano,

a village between the Osa and the Albsgna, and 8 or

10 miles to the N. uf Orbelello. To Mr. Dennis

(Cities and Sepulchres of Etruria. vol. ii. eh. 48),

however, is to be assigned the credit of first identi­

fying these remains as those of the lost Etruscan

city. Their site agrees with what we learn respecting

that of Vetulonia. Pliny and Ptolemy (11. cc.) agree

in placing the latter among the inland colonies of

Etruria; yet Pliny (ii. 103. s. 10G) also describes it as

being not far from the sea, and as having hot springs,

the Aquae Vetuloniae, in its neighbourhood. Mow,

all the necessary conditions are fulfilled by the re­

mains alluded to. The circuit of the walls, about 4£

miles, shows it to have been an important city; its

situation with regard to the sea agrees with the

account of Pliny; and near Telamcmaccio, at a

distance of only 200 or 300 yards from the coast,

and in the vicinity of the newly found city, warm

springs still exist. For other reasons which led Mr.

1'ennis to the opinion which he formed, the reader is

referred to liis work before cited, and to his paper in

the Classical Museum, vol. ii. p. 229, F©q. For coins

UFENS (Cfevte),a. river of Latium, rising at the

foot of the Volscian mountains, and flowing through

the Pontine Marshes, whence its course is slow and

.stagnant, and it is described by both Virgil and

Kilius Italicua, as a sluggish and muddy stream.

(Virg. A en. vii. 801 ; Sil. Ital. viii. 382.) Claudian

also calls it " tardatus suis erroribns Ufer.s." (Proh.

et 01. Cans. 257.) It joins the Amasenus (still

called Amaseno) during its course through the

marshes to the sea at Ttrracina, but the present

channels of both rivers are artificial, and it is un­

certain whether they united their streams in ancient

times or not. The name is corrupted by Strabo

into Aufidus (Atf<J>i5os, v. p. 233), but he correctly

describes it as one of the chief agents in the forma­

tion of the Pontine Marshes. The ancient form of |

the name was Oufens, whence the Roman tribe

Oufentina derived its name, being composed ori­

ginally of citizens settled in the territory and

neighbourhood of Privernum (Feat. s.v. Ovfentma,

p. 194). [E. H. B.J

Ugernum is represented by Bcawaire. The Table

marks the distance from Nemausus (Ximes) to

Ugernum xv., which is near the truth. In the last

century the Roman road between Nemausus and

Ugernum was discovered with several milestones

on it in their original position, and numbered, as it
