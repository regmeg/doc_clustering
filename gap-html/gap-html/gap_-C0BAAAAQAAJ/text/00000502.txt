west. Strabo speaks of it as rising opposite to

Aetna, so that lie would seem to apply the name to

the mountains between that peak and the northern

coast, which are .still covered with the extensive

forests nt' Caronia. Siliua It aliens, on the other

hand, tells us that it was in the Mons Nebrodes the

two rivers of the name of Himera had their sources,

which can refer only to the more westerly proup of

the Monti di Mwhnila, tiie most lofty range in

Sicily after Aetna, and this indentitieation is gene­

rally adopted. But, a* already observed, there is no

real distinction between the two. Silius Italtcus

speaks of the Mons Nebrodes as covered with forests,

and Solinus derives its name from the number of

fawns that wandered through them; an etymology

obviously fictitious. (Strab. vi. p. 274; Solin. 5.

§§ 11,12; .Sil.Ital.xiv.2o6; Cluver. Sieil. p. 364;

N EDA (Nt5a), now Bttzi, a river of Peloponnesus,

rises in Mt. Cerauaium, a branch of Mt. Lycaeus in

Arcadia, and Hows with many windings in a westerly

direction past Phipalia, first forming the bound­

ary between Arcadia and Messenia, ;t,|d afterwards

between Elis and Messenia. It falls into the Ionian

pea, and near its mouth is navigable for small boats.

NKDAD, a river of Pannonia, mentioned only

by Jornaudes {de Reb. Get. 50), as the river on the

banks of which the Huns were defeated by the

Gepidae. The name is in some MSS. Nedao, and t lie

riv cr is believed to he the modem Seylra. [L.S.]

NED1NUM (N^Stiw, Ptol. ii. 16. § 10; Geog.

the Liburni, on the road from Siscia to Iadera (Peut.

NELCYNDA (ra N«AKiir5a, Peripl. §§ 53, 54.

ed. Mtiller, 1855). a port on the W. coast of India,

in the province called Lirnyrica, without doubt the

same as that now called NelUeram It is in lat.

12° 10'N. It is mentioned in various authorities

under names slightly moditied one from the oilier:

thus, it is the Melcynda of Ptolemy (vii. 1. §9),

in the country of the Aii; the "partus gentis Nca-

cyndon " of Pliny (vi. 20. s. 104), which was also

called Bacure or Baraee; the Nincylda of the Peu-

tingerian Table; and NUeinna of the Geopr.Riven,

(ii. 1). The name is certainly of Indian origin,

and may be derived, as sui'^ested hy Kilter (v.

p. 515) from Nilakhanda, the blue county. Other

derivations, however, have Iwu proposed for it.

small Hellenic town above Lekhmia. (Strab. ix.

p. 430; Leake, Northern Greece, vol. iv. p. 379.)

NELO, a small river of Uispania Tarraconensis,

in the territory of the Astures, and on the X. coast

of Spain; probably the Rio de la Pnente. (Plin. iv.

20. s. 34; Ukert, vol. ii. pt. 1. p. 299.) [T.H.D.]

NEMALONI, an Alpine people. In the Trophy

of the Alps the name of the Neinaloni occurs be­

tween the Brodiontii and Edenates. (Plin, id. 21)

The site of this people is uncertain. It is t n*:<*

puess to place them, as some do, at Miobint.h its

valley of Barcelonette. [G. L]

NEMAUSUS (Ne/iowcot: Elk. 'St^aunos. Ne-

mausensis: Nimes), a city of Gallia Nar^r*:!:-;^ m

tlie road from Andate (Aries') through N*r+»>

(Xarboime) into Spain. Ptolemy (ii. iO. § 10) a..j

it Nemausus Colonia, but he places it in the swr-

latitude as Arausio {Orange), and more than i

decree north of Arelate; which are creat blower*.

Nemausus was the chief place of the Yolcae Atoj-

mici: "with respect to number of foreitrn^rs an«i th-w

engaged in trade (says Strab. iv. p. 18f») nwh icfc-

rior to Narbo, but with respect to its pnpul-vtion raofb

superior: for it has subject to it twenty-four villas

of people of the same stock, populous villages wlkd

are contributory to Xernausus, which has wlii a

called the Latium (Jus Latii or Lutinitas). Bt

virtue of this right those who have obtained tte

honour of an aedilesbip and quaestorship in Ne­

mausus become Roman citizens; and for this msa

this people is not un«!er the orders of the porww*

from Home. Now the city is situated oq them*!

from Iberia into Italy, winch road in the sumuwria

easy travelling, but in the winter and spnuc ii

muddy and washed by streams. Some of th**a

streams are passed by boats, and others by turUr*

of wood or stone. The wintry torrents are tbr caiw

of the trouble from the water, for these torrfrrs

sometimes as late as the summer descend fnai UJ

Alps after the melting of the snow."

Strabo fixes the site of Xernausus about 100 staflfl

from the Phone, at a point opposite to Tara*coc.i»

720 stadia from Narbo, In another place (iv. p. 17>

Strabo estimates the distance from Xarbo to S*

The site of the place is certain. In the middje ta
