1212 TIRYNS.

TISIA.

Dorians. The strong fortress of Tityns was dan­

gerous to tiie neighbouring Dorian colony of Argos.

After the dreadful defeat of the Arrives by Cleo-

rnenes, their .slaves took possession of Tiryns and

held it for many years, (Herod, vi. 83.) " In the

Persian War the Tirynthians sent some men to the

battle of Platnea. (Herod, ix. 28.) Subsequently

their city was taken by the Argives, probably about

the same time as Mycenae, B.C. 468. The lower

city wa.s entirely destroyed; the citadel was disman­

tled; and the inhabitants fled to Epidaurus and

Halieis, a town on the coast of Hermionis. (Strab.

viii. p. 373; Ephorus, ap. Str jih. Ji. s. v. *A\i6(?;

Kustath. ad Horn. II. ii. f>50, p. 286,) It was pro­

bably owing to this circumstance that Stephanus B.

(s. v. Tipuvs) was led into the mistake of saying

that Tiryns was formerly called Halieis. The Ti-

rynthians, who did not succeed in effecting their

escape, were removed to Argos. (Pans. ii. U5. § 8.)

From this time Tiryns remained uninhabited; and

when Pausanias visited the city in the second cen­

tury of our era, he saw nothing but the remains of

the walls of the citadel, and beneath them towards

the sea the so-called chambers of the daughters of

Proetns. Notrace of the lower city appears to have

been left. The citadel was named Licymna, after

Licymnius, son of Electryon, who was slain at Tiryns

by Tleptolemus, son of Hercules. (Strab. vii. p. 373;

Pind. Ol. vii. 47.) Hence Statius calls the marshes

in the neighbourhood of Tiryns " stagna Licymnia."

( Thtb. iv. 734.) Theophrxstns represents the Ti-

rynthians as celebrated for their laughing propen­

sities, which rendered them incapable of attention

to serious business (ap. A then. vi. p. 261, d.).

The ruins of the citadel of Tiryns are now called

Paled Andpli. They occupy the lowest and flattest

of several rocky hills, which rise like islands out of

the plain. The impression which they produce

upon the beholder is well described by Col. Mure:

"This colossal fortress is certainly the greatest

curiosity of the kind in existence. It occupies the

table summit of an oblong hill, or rather knoll, of

small extent or elevation, completely encased in

masses of enormous stones, rudely piled in tiers one

above another, into the form alternately of towers,

curtain walls, abutments, gates, and covered ways.

There is not a fragment in the neighbourhood

indicating the existence of suburb or outer town at

any period; and the whole, rising abruptly from the

dead level of the surrounding plain, produces at a

distance an effect very similar to that of the hulk

of a man-of-war floating in a harbour." The

length of the summit of the rock, according to Col.

Leake's measurement, is about 250 yards, the

breadth from 40 to 80, the height above the plain

from 20 to 50 feet, the direction nearly N. and S.

Tiie entire circuit of the walls still remains more or

less preserved. They consist of huge masses of

stone piled upon one another, as Pausanias describes.

The w;ill is from about 20 to 25 feet in thickness,

ami it had two entrances, one on the eastern, and

the other on the southern side. "In its general

design the fortress appears to have consisted of an

upper and lower enclosure of nearly equal dimen­

sions, witl) an intermediate platform, which may

have served for the defence of the upper castle

against an enemy in possession of the lower. The

southern entrance led by an ascent to the left into

the upper inclosure, and by a direct passage between

the npjier inclosure and the eastern wall of the for­

tress into the lower inclosure, having also a branch

to the left into the middle platform, tbe eatr»-*

which last was nearly opposite la the efc4ero:ttt
