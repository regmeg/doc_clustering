is Noeomapus in Ptolemy (ii. 0. § 17). In Am*

minim Mareellinus- fxv. 11. ztl 2) and the Notitia

Imp. it occurs under the name of tlie people, Nemetes

or Nemetae. It is now sprier, near tlie small stream

called Speierbach, which flows into tlie Rhine. In

some of the late Notitiae we read " civitas Nemetum,

id est, Spin." (D'Anville, Xotice, <fc)

3. A town of the Batavi, is the Dutch town of

Xynu-rjen, on the Vahalis ( Waal). It is marked in

the Tahle as a chief town. D'Anville observes that

the station Ad Duodecimum [DcODBCXMCY, An]

is placed by the Table on a Roman road, and next

to Noviomapus ; and that this shows that Novio-

mapus bad a territory, for capital places used to

reckon the distances from their city to the limits of

their territory.

4. A town of the Bitnriges Vivisei. (Ptol. ii. 7.

§ 8.) [BiTUBXOtt Ymsci.]

5. A town of the Remi, i.s placed by the Table on

a ro:td which, leading from Durocortonim (Reim*)to

a position named Mosa, must cross the Maas at

Momon [MooOMAGCft.] Noviomapus is xii. from

Durocortorum, and it is supposed by D'Anville to be

Xcucille.

6. A town of the Treviri, is placed in the Anto-

nine It in. xiii. from Tritr, on the jtfbfet In the

Table it is viii., but as viii. is far from the troth,

D'Anville supposes that the v. in tlie Table should

be x. The river bends a pood deal below Trier, and

in one of the elbows which it forms is Xcumaffen,

the representative of Noviomapus. It is mentioned

in Ananoittt'fl poem (Mosefla, v. II):—

"Novimapum divi castra inclita ConsUntini."

It is saiil that many Roman remains have been found

at Kemmagtn.

7. A town of the VeromanduL In the Antoninc

Itin. this phice is fixed at 27 M. P. from SoUsons,

at.d 34 M P. from Amiens. But their distances, as

D'Anville says, are not exact, for Noviodmtuin is

Am/on, which is further from Amiens and nearer to

Soatotu than the Itin. fixes it. The alteration of

the name Noviomapus to Xoyon is made clearer

when we know that in a middle age document the

name is Noviomum, from which to Sot/on the change

is easy. [G. L.]

capital of the Regni in Britannia Prima, marked in

the Itin. Ant. (p. 472) as the first station on the

rn.id from London to Durovernum, and as 10 miles

distant from the former town. It has been variously

placed at IVoodcote in Surrey, anil iJul wood Jfiil in

Kent. Camden, who adopts the former site in his

description of 5wrre*(p. 192), seems in hisdescrip-

tion of Kent (p. 219) to prefer the latter; where

on the little river Ravetuboum^ there still remain

traces of ramparts and ditches of a vast extent.

This site would also agree better with the distances

in the Itinerary. [T. H. I>.J

NOVIOREGUM, in Gallia, is placed by the An-

tonine Itin. on a road from Rurdipala {Bordeaux)

to Mediolaiium Santonum (&iintf&); and between

Tamnum (Toltmm or TmBcmomf) and Mediolanum.

D'Anville supposes Noviore^um to be Roman on the

north *dde of the Girorufe; but this place is quite

out of the direct road to Haintes. as D'Anville

admits. He lias to correct the distance also in the

Itin. between Tamnum and Noviorepum to make

it atrree with the distance between Talmon and

Hoyan. [(;. L.]
