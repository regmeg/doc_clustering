si) called, but a mere triumphal arch situated in the

Campus Marti us. The theory of Bunsen necessarily

rests on the assumption of a different line of wall

from that laid down in the preceding account; and

its another line is also adopted by Niehuhr (Hist. i.

p. 397, Ethnogr. ii. p. 49), it will be necessary to

examine this point before proceeding to the question

of the pate. Niebuhr and Bunsen are, however, far

from coinciding. The line drawn by the former

proceeds along the banks of the river; that drawn

by the latter runs from the Porta Carmentalis to

the X. angle of the Circus Mazimus, and, adopt­

ing the NW. front of the circus, or what was

called the Oppidum, as part of the line, pro­

ceeds onwards to the Aventine, thus shutting the

greater part of the Forum Boarium out of the city.

Both these theories, however, agree in so faraa they

assume an enceinte continue, or continued line of

wall; and therefore, if this notion can be shown to

be false, both tall to the ground. Now it can be

proved on the very best evidence that there was no

wall in this part of the city, which was defended

solely by the Tiber. We have already adduced a

p;tosage from Dionysius in confirmation of this

statement; and the same author in another passage

repeats the same thing in so plain a manner that

there can be no reasonable doubt of the fact:

i6trj<rtv i) w6\ts dKwvou Kara Kpdros ftTei^iffros

oh<ra 4k 7wv irapa tov vora/jbv ntpwv (v. '23).

Hut Dionysius does not stand alone. We have

Livy also as a voucher for the same fact, who, in

narrating the enterprise of Porsena against Rome,

observe* that the citizens regarded some parls of

their city as secured by the wall, arid other parts by

the Tit»er: "Alia nmris, aha Tiberi objecto videbantur

tuta (ii. 10). The same fact appears, though not

in so direct a manner, from the same author's ac­

count of the procession of the virgins from the

temple of Apollo, outside the Carmental gate, to that

of Juno Kegina on the Aventine, to which we have

before briefly alluded. The route is described as

follows; "A porta (Carmentali) Jugario vico in

forum ventre. Inde vico Tusco Velabroque per

Boarium forum in clivum Public!um atque aedem

Junonis Reginae perrectum" (xxvii. 37). Now the

small space allotted by Bunsen to the Forum Boa­

rium must have been inside of the wall, since the

temples of Fortune and Mater Matuta, which stood

iij>on it (Liv, xxxiii. 27), were within the Porta

Carmentalis (Id. xxv. 7). The procession, then,

after passing through that forum, must have gone

out of the city at another gate,— Bunsen's Flumen-

tana,—and have entered it again by the Trigemiua,

before it could reach the CHvua Publicius, —

facts which are not mentioned by Livy in his very

preckse description of the route.

Having thus shown on the best evidence that no

wall ox.i-.ted at this point, it would be a mere waste

of time to refute arguments intended to show that

it possibly might have existed,—such as whether a

wall with a gate would keep out an inundation,

whether tin* Fabii went over the Sublician bridge,

and others of the like sort, which would have puz-

zled an ancient harnspex. We will therefore pro­

ceed to examine Becker's hypothesis, that the Porta

Triumphalis was, in fact, no gate at all. but merely

an arch in the Campus Martins, a theory which is

al.Mj adopted, though with some little variation, by

Preller (Regimen, p. 162, and Anhang, p. 239).

Becker places this arch at the s^-ot where the

Campus Martius joins the Kegio called Circus

F la mini 01, and takes it to be the same tUt *ss t»-

built by Domitian (of cuur>e he must mean rW>«Jr,

though it is not very clearly expressed. I*. J/rn.

p. 92, Ilandb. p. 153). His conjecture fcuvu

on the following lines in a poem of Minimi? {rs±

65) in which lie describes the erection Uu»

and of some other buildings near it: —

"Haec est digna tuis, Gennaruee. forli tr

Hos aditus urbem Marti> habere dec*!.*

Becker, however, is totally unable to prove last'.a*

arch and the temple of Fort una Kedux near rt «r«

even in the Campus Martins at ail. Ihus he

(Ilandb. p. 642): " It is not indeed exprewif s*.

that the Ara of Fortuna Ret hi x was in thr Cits-

Martins; but it bt comes /m>b<dile from tbe enr»

Btance that Domitian built here. and. u b«t

conjectured at p. 153, close to the Porta Tnuafskaa.

a temple to the same goddess." The ir^

then proceeds as follows: "We hu<te t'nci Uar^K

that Domitian built a temple to Fortuna l*an

w here her altar formerly stood, and also a trmca**

arch near it. We do not hioic that this alia.*™

in the Campus Marti us; but it is j*r»bobi* ta: *

was, because Domitian built this temple cl«* t> ■",

and also close to tbe arch, whkh, as / aw/rc^w*,

was the Porta Triumphalis!"

There is, however, another palace of Ma-aa

either overlooked or ignored by Berker. whica feaa

very strongly to show that this arrh of lx«£iai

really was in the Campus Marti us, but at yis* i

different spot from that so conveniently fcx&i ssfl

by him. It is the following (x. 6) : —

"Felices qui bus urna dedit ^r^<■

omnis

Lucebit Latia culta fenestra mini?

Quando morae dukes, longus^ue a Caeaav

Tutaque Flaminia Roma, videuda. via?*

There can be no doubt that these lines refer toll

same triumphal entry of Domitian's as t}m»t

by Becker; and they pretty plainly thnw, m t\
