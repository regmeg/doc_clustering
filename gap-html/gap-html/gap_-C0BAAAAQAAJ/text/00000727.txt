1. Old Pleuron ( v waAoia TWtvpav, Strab. x-

p. 451), was situated in the plain between the Ache-

lous and the Evenus, W. of Calydon, at the foot of

Mount Curium, from which the Curetes are said to

have derived their name. Pleuron and Calydon

were the two chief towns of Actolia in the heroic

age, and are said by Strabo ( x. p. 450) to have been

the ancient ornament (tooVxwO of Greece. Pleuron

was originally a town of the Curetes, and its inhabit­

ants were engaged in frequent wars with the Aeto-

lians of the neighbouring town of Calydon. The

Curetes, whose attack upon Calydon is mentioned in

an episode of the Iliad (ix. 529), appear to have

been the inhabitants of Pleuron. At the time of

the Trojan War, however, Pleuron was an Aetolian

city, and its inhabitants sailed against Troy under

the command of the Aetolian chief Thoas, the son

(not the grandson) of Oeneus. (Horn. II. ii. 639,

comp. xiii. 217, xiv. 116.) Ephorus related that

the Curetes were expelled from I'leuronia, which

was formerly called Curetis, by Aeolians (ap. Strab.

x. p. 465); and this tradition may also be traced in

the statement of Thucydides (iii. 102) that the

district, called Calydon and Pleuron in the time of

the Peloponnesian War, formerly bore the name of

Aeolis. Since Pleuron appears as an Aetolian city

in the later period of the heroic age, it is represented

in some traditions as such from the beginning.

Hence it is said to have derived its name from

Pleuron, a son of Aetolus; and at the very time

that some legends represent it as the capital of the

Curetes, and engaged in war with Oeneus, king of

Calydon, others suppose it to have been governed by

the Aetolian Thestius, the brother of Oeneus. Thes-

tius was also represented as a descendant of Pleuron;

and hence Pleuron had an heroum or a chapel at

Sparta, as being the ancestor of Leda, the daughter

of Thestius. But there are all kinds of variations

in these traditions. Thus we find in Sophocles

Oeneus, and not Thestius, represented as king of

Pleuron. (Apollod. i. 7. § 7; Pans. iii. 14. § 8;

Soph. Track. 7.) Ope of the tragedies of Phry-

nichus, the subject of which appears to have been the

death of Meleagcr, the son of Oeneus, was entitled

nAcvpcwiaf, or the "Pleuronian Women;" and

hence it is not improbable that Phrynichus, as well

as Sophocles, represented Oeneus as king of Pleuron.

(Pans. x. 31. § 4.) Pleuron is rarely mentioned

in the historical jieriod. It was abandoned by its

inhabitants, says Stralto, in consequence of the ra­

vages of Demetrius, the Aetolian, a surname proba­

bly given to Demetrius II., king of Macedonia (who

reigned B.C. 239—229), to distinguish him from

Demetrius Poliorcctes. (Strab. x. p. 451.) The in­

habitants now built the town of

2. New PijifRox (^ vttrripa IlA«i/pc£i'), which

was situated at the foot of Mt. Aracynthus. Shortly

before the destruction of Corinth (n. c 146), wo

find Pleuron, which was then a member of the

Achaean League, petitioning the Romans to be dis­

severed from it. (Paus. vii. 11. § 3.) I.eake sup­

poses, on satisfactory grounds, the site of New Pleu­

ron to be represented by the ruins called to Kdcrrpov

■njj Kvpias Eip^njs, or the Couth of Laity Irrnc

about one hour's ride from Mtxolamjhi. These ruins

occupy the broad summit of one of the steep and

rngL'ed heights of Mt. /.ygot (the ancient Aracyn­

thus), which bound tlte plain of Mttolonghi to the

north. Leake says that the walls were about a mile

in circumference, but Mure and Dudwell describe the

circuit as nearly two miles. The most remarkable
