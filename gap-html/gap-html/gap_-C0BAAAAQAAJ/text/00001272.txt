a powerful force in Thrace, the Paeonians could

hardly have succeeded in making their escape from

Phrygia back to the Strymon (Id. v. 98), nor could

the revolted lonians (b. c. 498) have taken Byzan­

tium and all the other cities in that country. (Id.

v. 103.) It is to this period that we must refer the

invasion of the Scythians, who are said to have ad­

vanced as far as the Chersonesus, thus occasioning

the temporary flight of Miltiades, who, they were

aware, had assisted Darius in his attack upon their

country. (Id. vi. 40.)

After the suppression of the Ionian revolt (d. c.

493), the Phoenician fleet sailed to the Hellespont,

and again brought the country under the Persian

dominion, Cardiu being the only city which they

were unable to take. (Id. vi. 33.) Miltiades made

bis escape from the Chersonesus to Athens, on hear­

ing of the approach of the hostile fleet. (76. 41.)

Next year Mardonius led an army across the

Hellespont, and advanced as far as Macedonia ; but

his fleet having been wrecked off Mount Athos, and

his land forces having suffered considerably in a war

with the Thracians, who then occupied the country

W. of the Strymon, he retraced his steps, and trans­

ported his shattered army into Asia (Id. vi. 43, seqq.).

It was not till ii. c. 480 that the vast army under

the command of Xerxes crossed the Hellespont by

the famous bridges which spanned the strait from

Abydos to Septus. Of his march through Thrace,

Herodotus gives an interesting account (vii. 10$—

115); hut, as he met with no opposition, we need not

dwell upon these circumstances.

Atter the disastrous battle of Salamis, Xerxes,

with an escort <<f 60,000 men, hastened back by the

same road which he had so recently trod in all the

overweening confidence of despotic power: in Thrace,

his miserable troops suffered greatly from hunger

and consequent disease, but do not appear to have

been openly attacked. (Herod, vhi. 115, seqq.)

Next year (b. c. 479) was fought the battle of

Plataeae in which Thracians formed part of the

motley host arrayed against Greek freedom (Id. ix.

32). Artabazus led the 40,000 men, who alone

remained of the Persian army, by forced marches

through Thessaly, Macedonia, and Thrace. He struck

through tlie interior of the latter country, probably

for tear of the Greek cities on the coast; but he en­

countered enemies as much to be dreaded, and lost a

great part of his army by hunger, fatigue, and the at­

tacks of the Thracians, before he reached Byzantium.

It was now the turn of the victorious Greeks to

assail their foes in their own territories. Thrace,

with the exception of Doriscus, was soon cleared of

the Persians. After the battle of Mycale, their fleet

sailed to the Hellespont, where the Athenians laid

siege to Scstns, which was taken early in the following

year (b. c. 478) [Sestcs]. Eion, at the mouth

of the Strymon, made a desperate resistance ; but at

length (u. c. 470) fell into the hands of Cimon and

the Athenians, after its Persian governor had put to

death all his family, and finally himself. (Herod,

vii. 107; cf. Thucyd. i. 98). Byzantium had been

taken by Pausanias the year before. Thus the Per­

sians were driven out of Europe, and the Greek

settlements in Thrace resumed their internal freedom

of action, though most of them, it is probable, were

muter the supremacy of Athens, as the chosen head

of the great Greek confederacy.

During the administration of Pericles, 1000 Athe­

nian citizens were settled in the Tliracian Cher­

sonesus, which was always the chief stronghold of

Athens in that quarter. Under fbe rar^-m r*:*
