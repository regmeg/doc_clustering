a few miles N. of Ancona, to the Utis (Montone).

(Liv, v. 35.) The history of their migration from

Transalpine Gaul, their settlement in Italy, ami

their wars with the Romans, which ended in tiie

extermination of the whole nation, are fully related

under the article Gallia Cisalpina (pp. 93b'—

938). After the conquest of the Senones, and their

expulsion from their lands on the Adriatic, two

colonies were founded in their territory, the one at

Sena, the other at Ariminum; and at a later period

the remainder of their lands was portioned out

among the Roman citizens by an agrarian law of

the tribune C. Klaminius. This district, which still

retained the name of the " Gallicus ager,"' was after­

wards considered as a part of Umbria, and included

for all administrative purposes under that appella­

tion. Its topography will therefore be most con­

veniently given in the article Umbria. [E. H. B.]

SE'NTICE (2sfTiffi7, Ptol. ii. 6. § 50), a town

of the Vaccaei in H is pan i a Tarmconeiisis, variously

identified with I.os Santos, Zamora, Cnlzadilhi de

ManiU'jPS, and Zarzosa. [T. H. L).]

SE'NTIDES(2«Vn5«, Ptol. iv. 5. § 21), a people

SE'NTl I (SfVnot), a people of Gallia Nar-

bonensis (Ptol. ii. 10. § 19), whose town Ptolemy

SENT/XUM (%€vt7vov; Eth. Set'Tiwmjs, Sen-

tinas -fitis . Sentino), a city of Umbria, on the E.

slope of the Apennines, but near the central ridge of

those mountains, and not far from the sources of the

Aesis (Esino). It is celebrated in history as the

scene of a great battle fought in the Third Samnite

War, B. <;. 295, when the allied forces of the Samnitea

and Gauls were defeated by the Roman consul Q.

Fabius. Gellius Egnatius, the Samnite general, was

slain in the battle : while the Roman consul P. Decius

followed the example of his father, and devoted him-

faelf for the safety of the Roman army. (Liv. x. 27

—30; Pol. ii. 19.) The scene of this decisive vic­

tory, one of the most memorable in the Roman annals,

is placed by Livy " in Sentinati agro but we have

no more precise clue to its position, nor do the details

of the buttle give us any assistance. Sentinum itself

seems to have been a strong town, as in thePerusian

War it was besieged by Oetavinn himself without

success; though it was afterwards taken by surprise

by his lieutenant, Salvidienus Rufns, by whom it was

plundered and burnt to the ground. (Dion Cass,

xlviii. 13.) It was subsequently revived, by receiving

a body of colonists, under the Triumvirate (Lib. Col.

p. 258), but did not obtain the title of a Oolouia, and

continued under the Roman Empire to be a town

of municipal rank. (Plin. iii. 14. s. 19; Strab. v.

p. 227; Ptol. iii. 1. § 53; Orel!. I riser. 3861, 4949.)

Its site is marked by the village still called Sentino,

on the river of the same name (a small stream falling

into the AVtiw), a few miles below the modern town

of Sassa Ferrato. [E. H. B ]

SKNTS (£cvos or 2a7;o?, Ptol. vii. 3. § 2). a
