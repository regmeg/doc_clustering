On the plain of Philippi, between Haemus and

PangaeuH, the last battle was lotit by the republicHns

of Rome. Appian (I. c.) has given a clear descrip­

tion of Philippi, and the posiiion on which Cassius

aud Brutus encamped. The town was situated on

a steep hill, bordered to the N. by the forests

through which the Caspian army advanced,— to the

S. by a marsh, beyond which was the sea, to the

E. by the passes of the Sapaei and Corpili, and to

the W. by the great plains of Myrcinu?, Drahescun,

and the Strymon, which were S50 utadia in length.

Not far from Philippi, was the hill of Dkhivmis,

containing the gold mines called A*yla; and 18

stadia from the town, were two other heights, 8

stadia asunder; on the one to the N. Brutus

pitched his camp, and Cassius on that to the S.

Brutus was protected on his right by rorky hills,

and the left of Cassias by a mar>h. The river

Gangas or Gangites flowed along the front, and the

Bea was in the rear. The camps of the two leaders,

although separate, were enclosed within a common

entrenchment, and midway between them was the

pass, which led like a gate from Europe to Asia.

The galleys were at Neapolis. 70 stadia distant, and

the commissariat in Thasos, distant 100 stadia.

Dion Cassius (xlvii. 35) adds, that Philippi was

near Pangaeus and Symbolum, and that Symbolum,

which was between Philippi and Neapolis, was so

called because it connected Pangaeus with another

mountain stretching inland; which indentities it

with the ridge which stretches from Prdvista to

Kavdla, separating the bay of Kavdla from the

plain of Philippi. The Pylue, therefore, could be no

other than the pass over that mountain behind

Kavdla. M. Antonius took up his position on the

right, opposite to that of Cassius, at a distance of 8

stadia from theenemy. Octavius Caesar was opposed

to Brutus on the "left hand of the even field."

Here, in the autumn of u. c. 42, in the first engage­

ment, Brutus was successful against Octavius,

while Antonius had the advantage over Ca^ius.

Brutus, incompetent to maintain the discipline of

his troops, was forced to fight again; and in an

engagement which took place on the same ground,

twenty days afterwards, the KepnMic perished.

Regarding the battle a curious mistake was re­

peated by the Roman writers (Manil. i. 908; Ovid,

Met xv. 824; Flor. iv. 42; Lucan, i. 680, vii.

854, ix. 271; Jnv. viii. 242), who represented it as

fought on the same ground as Pharsalia.—a mistake

which may have arisen from the ambignity in the

lines of Virgil (Georg. i. 490), and favoured by the

fact of the double engagement at Philippi. (Meri-

vale, Hist, of Roman Empire, vol. iii. p. 214.)

Augustus afterwards presented it with the privileges

of ** a colonia," with the name" Col. Jul. Aug. Philip."

(Orelli, Inter. 512, 3658, 3746, 4064; and on

coins; Rasche, vol. iii. pt 2. p. 1120), and con­

ferred upon it the " Jus Italicum." (Dion Cass. li.

4.) It was here, in his second missionary journey,

that St. Paul, accompanied hy Silas, came into con­

tact with the itinerant traders in popular superstitions

{Acts, xvi. 12—40); and the city was again visited

by the Apostle on his departure from Greece, {Acts,

xx. 6.) The Gospel obtained a home in Knrope

here, for the first time; and in the autumn of a. d.

62, its great teacher, from his prison, under the walia

of Nero's palace, sent a letter of grateful acknow­

ledgment to his Macedonian converts. Philippi was
