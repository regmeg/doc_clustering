318 MELA.MBIUM. MELAS.

mains of a Roman bath, which has also been a

church, and is sometimes used as such, though it is

aaid to be generally inundated, even in the dry

season, which is in conformity with the account of

Pau-sanias. The Peutinger Table specifies Melae-

neae as distant 12 miles from Olympia; but it does

not mention Heraea, though a much more important

place, and one which continued to exist long after

Heraea: moreover, the distance of 12 miles applies

to Heraea, and not to Melaeneae. (Pans. viti. 26.

§ 8, eomp. t. 7. § 1, viii. 3. § 3; Steph. B. >. r.;

Plin. ir. 6. s. 10; Leake, Pelopormenaca, p. 231;

Boblaye, Recherchei, <jc. p. 159; Curtius, Pelopon-

nesns, vol. i. p. 356.)

MELA'MBIUM (MtXaVfior), a place in Pelas-

giotis in Thessaly, near Scottrssa, is mentioned in

connection with the movements of the armies before

the battle of Cynosccphalae. Leake places it near

the sources of the Onchestus, at a place called

Dederianl. (Polyb. xviii. 3, 6; Liv. xxxiii. C;

Leake, Northern Greece, vol. iv. p. 473.)

MELANCHLAENl (MeAa-yxAau-oi), a nomad

tribe, the name of which first appears in Hecataeus

(ap. Steph. B., Fr. 154, ed. Klausen). In the geo­

graphy of Herodotus (iv. 20,100—103,107) they are

found occupying the districts E. of the Androphagi,

and N. of the Royal Scythians, 20 days' journey

from the Palus Maeotis; over above them were

lakes and lands unknown to man. It has been con­

jectured that Herodotus may refer, through some

hearsay statement, to the lakes Ladoga and Onega.

Theie has been considerable discussion among geo­

graphers as to the position which should bo assigned

to this tribe: it is of course impossible to fix this

with any accuracy; but there would seem to be

reason to place them as far N. as the sources of the

Polga, or even further. (Schafarik, Slav. Alt.

vol. i. p. 295.) Herodotus expressly says that they

did not belong to the Srythian-Scolotic stock, al­

though their customs were the same. The name, the

"Black-cloaks," like that of their cannibal neigh­

bours, the Anthropophagi, was applied to tbem by

the Greeks, and was no corrupted form of any indi­

genous appellation. A people bearing this name is

mentioned by Sojlax of Caryanda (p. 32) as a tribe

of Pontus. Pomponius Mela (i. 19. § 4) and Pliny

(vi. 5) coincide with Scylax, who speaks of two

rivers flowing through their territory, the Meta-

H>itis(MfroVt>f»!), probably the same as the Thes-

»YRis (e«V»vpit,Ptol. v. 9. §§ 10, 30: Kamuiliar),

and the AEOinos (AryiTiot: Kentichli). Diony-

sius Periegetes (v. 309) places this people on the

Borysthenes, and Ptolemy (v. 9. § 19) between the

river Rha and the Hippici Monies, in Asiatic Sar-

niatia; but it would be a great error to found any

observation concerning these ancient northern tribes

upon either the Roman writers or Ptolemy, or to

confuse the picture set before us by these geogra­

phers, and the more correct delineations of Hero­

dotus. For the Melanchlaeui of Ammiamis (xxii. 8.

§ 31), see Ai.asi. [E. B. J.]

MKLANl)lTAE(M«Xai'o?Toi),apeople of Thrace,

mentioned only by Xenophon (Anab. rii. 2. § 32).

MELANGEIA. [Mantikkia, p. 264, b.]

MELA'NIA (M«Ao»io), a place on the coast of

Cilii ia, a little to the west of Celenderia, perhaps on

the site of the modern Kkliman. (Strab. xiv.

p. 670.) From another passage of Strata (xvi.

p. 760). compared with Stephanus B. («. r. Mf-

Aoivai), it would seem that the place was also called

Mclaenae. [L. S.J

MELAXIPPE or MELANIPPIUM (MsAar»*TT»

or MeAoyiTwioi*), a small town on the coast of Lycra,

on the western slope of Mount Phornicus, aboal

30 stadia from Cape Hieron, and 60 stadia south of

Gngae, of which Leake (^trwi Minor, p. 185) talirws

it to have been the port town. (Hecat. Frngm. 247;

Steph. B. s. v., who erroneouslv calls it a river; QoiaL

Smym. iii. 232; Stadiam, Mar. M. §§ 210. 211.)

Fellows (Itiicov. in Lycia, p. 212) found a few tonka

cut out of the cliffs of the neighbourhood. [L. S.]

MELANUGAETULI. [GAtmnJA.J

MELA'NTHIUS (MsAorfiot), a small river «a

the north coast of Pontus, forming the boundary

between Pontus Polemoniacus and Cappadocius, and

flowing into the Euxine a little to the east of Cutyora,

(Plin. U. N. vi. 4; Arrian, PeripL p. 17; Aocoym.

Peripl. p. 12; Tab. Petti., where it is called Ne-

lantus.) It is probably the same river as tliat o*w

bearing the name of JUciet Irmalc (Hamilton, Ke-

tearcha, i. p. 267.) [L. S.]

MELANTIAS (MeAoirtai), a village of Thrace,

on the river Athyras, and on the road from Hrnu Ira

to Byzantium, 18 miles from the latter. (/(. Ami.

MELA'NTII SCO'PULI (MeAaVvio. omrrsAW),

some rocks in the Aegaean sea, where Apulia ap­

peared to the Argonauts, probably lay between leana

and Myconus. (Strab. xiv. p. 636; A poll. KluL

iv. 1707; Scyl. p. 55; Hesych. t. r.; Apullod.Lt.

§ 26; Stadiam. §S 252, 270.)

MELAS (Me'Aat), the name of several rivers, »

called from the dark colour of their water.

1. A small river of Arcadia or Achilla, described

by Dionysius as flowing from Mount Erymantkaa.

(I)ionys. Per. 416; Callim. in Jor. 23.) Strata

(viii. p. 386) confounds it with the Prirua or Piems

in Achaia; but the reading is probably eomiiL

[Achaia, p. 14, a.]

2. A river of Botiitia. [Bokotia, p. 413, a.]

3. A river of Malis. which in the time of Herodiv

tus flowed into the Maliac gulf, at the distance uf 5

stadia from Trachis. It is now called the ifarro-

Neria, and falls into the Spereheius, after aniline !'«

waters with the Gurgo (Dyras), which also n<*A t»

flow in ancient times into the Maliac gulf (Herod,

vii. 198; Strab. ix. p. 428; Liv. xxxvi. 22; Leake,

Northern Greece, voL ii. p. 26.)

4. A river of Phthiotis in Thessaly, and a tribo-

tary of the Apidanus. (Lucan, vi. 374; Vib. Seqa.

de Flum. t. v. Apidanot; Leake, Sorlhtm Crwca,

vol. iv. p. 515.)

5. A river of Thrace, now called Saldatti t*

Scheher-Su, falling into a deep bay of the same

name (Mc'Aai koAvos), which is bounded on the

east by the shore of the Thracian CherV»ne>ua. It-*

modem name of the bay is the gulf of Soros.

(Herod, vi. 41, vii. 58, 198; Strab. vii. p. Ml;

Liv. xxxiii. 40; Ptolein.ui. 11. §§ 1,2; UeU,ii.2;

Plin. iv. 11. s. 18.)

MELAS (M«Aoj). 1. A small river of Cappa-

docia, which had its sources on Mount Alcanas

(Ptol. v. 6. § 8), and flowed in a nonh-«e>:ero

direction past the town of Maiaca, frequently over­

flow-in;* its hanks and forming marshes. (Strab. xii.

p. 5.18, &c.) It emptied itself into the river Hairs,

oppubile the town of Siva. Strata (Ac-) erroneously

describes the Melas as a tributary of Uw Kuphratsa,

as has been shown by Hamilton in the Jomml ••/

the Geogr. Society, vol. viiL p. 149 (oxnp. his Kf-

marches, ii. p. 259, &C.). The river still bean a
