TARN'E (Tayrw), U mentioned by Homer (/7. v.

in Asia Minor; but Pliny (v. 30) knows Tarne only as

a fountain of Mount Tmolus in Lydia. [L. S.]

TARNIS (Tom), a river in Gallia, a branch of

the Garonne. It rises near Mount Lozere, in the

Cevennes, and flows in the upper part of its course

in a deep valley. After running near 200 miles it

joins the Garonne below Moissac. Sidonius Apol-

linaris (24. 44) calls it" citus Tarnis." [Lesora.]

Ausonius (.1/ose/Za, v. 465) speaks of the gold fuund

in the bed of the Tarn:—

"Et aurifcrum postponet Gallia Tarnem."

TARODU'XUM (Tap6lovvov), a town in the

the Rhenus. (Ptol. ii. 11. § 30.) It is universally

identified with Mark Zarten near Freiburg in the

Breisgau, which, down to the 8th century, bore the

name of Xarduna, a name which is furmeii from

Tarodunum in the same way in which Zabera is

formed from Tabernae. [L. S.]

TARPHE (Tdfxpri: Eth. Tap<p<uos)f a town of the

Locri Epicnemidii, mentioned by Homer (Fl. ii. 533).

It was situated upon a height in a fertile and woody

country, and was said to have derived its name from

the thickets in which it stood. In the time of

Strabo it had changed its name into that of Pharygaa

(&apvyat)t and was said to have received a colony

from Argos. It contained a temple at Hera Phary-

gaca. It is probably the modern J'wultmitza. (Strab.

the E. of Thrace, on the mad from Byzantium to

Anchialus. According to Kiepert, its site answers

to that of the modern Bojuk-Drrbend; according to

Reichard, to that of Ktxkje-Tarta; according to

Lapse, to that of Oevrlel-Agatch. But in some

maps it is placed nearly due south of Sadame, and

on or near the river Artiscus: if this is correct,

Tarpodizus must have beeu in the neighbourhood uf

TARQUI'NII (Tapjrwfa, Strab. Dionya.; Top.

Kuv'tvai, Ptol: Eth. Tarquiniensis: Cerneto), one of

the in -t ancient and important cities of Etruiia,

situated about 4 miles from the Tyrrhenian pea,

and 14 miles from On turn eel lae (Civita V$cckia)t

npar the left bank of the river Marta. All ancient

writers represent it as one of the most ancient of the

cities of Etruria; indeed according to a tradition

generally prevalent it was the parent or metn>|»"lis

of the twelve cities which composed the Etruscan

League, in the same manner as Alba was repre-ented

as the metropolis of the' Latin League. Its own

reputed founder was Tarchon, who according to some

accounts was the son, according to others the brother,

of the Lydian Tyrrhenus; while both versions repre­

sented him as subsequently founding all the other

cities of the league. (Strab. v. p. 219; Sen-, ad Arn.

x. 179, 198.) The same superiority of Tarquinii

may be considered as implied in the legends that

represented the divine being Tages, from whom all

the sacred traditions and religious rites of the

Etruscans were considered to emanate, as springing

out of the w)il at Tarquinii (Cic. dt Div. ii. 23;

Censorin. de- Die SaL 4; Juan. Lyd. de OsU 3.)
