1314 UMBRIA. ULIARUS INSULA.

ULIARUS INSULA (Eth. Olationensis, Sido-

niua Apollinaris), is placed by Pliny in the Aqui-

tanicus Sinus (iv. 19). It i,s tlie lie dOltron,

which belongs to the department of Chartnte Infe-

rieure, and is separated from the mainland by a

narrow strait. [G. L.]

ULIZIBERA (Ov\i(l€T)Pa, or OvAiffci^o, Ptol.

iv. 3. § 37), the Ulusubritanam of Pliny (v. 4. s.

4), a town of Byzacium in Africa Proper, S. of Ha-

drumetum. [T. H. I).]

ULLA (called by Ptolemy Oma, ii. 6. § 2), a

river on the W. coast of Hispania Tarraconensia,

which enters the sea between the Mimas and the

promontory of Nerium. (Mela, iii. 1.) It is still

called Ulla. [T. H. D.]

11LM A N ET ES. [Silvanectes.]

ULMI or ULMUS, a place frequently mentioned

in tlie Itineraries as situated in the interior of Lower

Pannonia on the road leading from Siecia to Cibalae

and Sinnium (It. Ant pp. 131, 232, 261,267;

It. liter vs. p. 563; Tab. Peui.); but its exact site

is uncertain. [L. S.]

ULMUS, a plaee in Upper Moesia, between Na-

issus and Kemesiana. (/tin Hieros. p. 566.) Ac­

cording to Lapie near Pauvlitz. [T. H. D.]

ULPIA'NUM. 1. (Oi>\iriai'<lv, Ptol. iii. 9. § 6),

called also Ulpiana (OuAiriavd, Hierocl. p. 656). a

town of Upper Moesia on the .southern declivity of ML

Scouiius. It was enlarged and adorned by Justinian,

whence it obtained the name of Justiniana Secunda,

(Procop. de Aed. iv. 1, Goth. iv. 25.) It is com­

monly identified with the present Ginstcndil; but

Leake (XortJtern Greece, iii. p. 475) takes that

town to represent the ancient Palilalia ur Pautalhi

in Thrace.

2. A place in Dacia, apparently in the neighbour­

hood of Klausenlun/. (Ptol. iii. 8. § 7.) [T. II. I).]

ULTERIOR PORTUS. [Itr-s Poktus.]

ULUBRAE {Kth. Ulubren^is), a small town of

Latium on the borders of the Pontine Marshes. It

is not mentioned in history previous to the establish­

ment of the Roman domiuion, but is noticed repeat­

edly by Latin writers of the best period, though

always as a poor and decayed town, a condition which

appears to have resulted from its marshy and un­

healthy position. Hence Cicero jestingly terms its

citizens little fro^s (ranunculi, Ep. adFam. vii. 18),

and both Horace and Juvenal select it as an almost

proverbial example of a deserted and melancholy

place. (Hor. Ep. i. 11. 30 ; Jut. x. 101.) Still it

appears from the expressions of the latter, that it

still retained the rank of a municipal town, and had

its own local magistrates ; and in accordance with

this, we find the Ulubrenses enumerated by Pliny

a mom; the municipal towns of the First Region. (Plin.

iii. 5. s. 9.) Tlie same thing is attested by inscrip­

tions (Orell. luscr. 121—123). and the discovery of

these at the place now called C'uterna, about eicht

miles from Vtlletri, and 35 from Koine, immediately

at the entrance of the Pontine Marshes, loaves no

doubt that Ulubrae was situated somewhere in

that neighbourhood. But the village of Cis-

terna (called in the middle a^es Cisterua Neronis),

does not appear to occupy an ancient site, and the

exact po>iti«>n i>f Ulubrae is still undetermined.

(Nibby, Dintomi di Kama, vol. i. p. 463.) [E.U.B.]

UMBLNXL'M. in Gallia Narbonensis, is placed

in the Jerusalem Itin. between liatiana [Batiana]

and Valentia {Valence'). [G. L.]

UMBRAE, line of many tribes placed by Pliny

near the mouth of the Indus, adjoining, perhaps

within, the larger district of Fattalrae (vi 2fiL

s. 23). [V]

UMBRANICI. a people of Gallia Xart-^ri!.

who had the Jus Latii. (Plin. iii. 4 ) T-*r» *

no further notice of these people who had this pdstak

privilege, except the occurrenff1 of the ruix \ 3-

branica or Umbranicia in the Tab5e. [G. L]

UMBRIA (rj 'OuSptKij: Eth. Umber,UmbrL O-

fipifcds), was one of the principal dirUio-oi ot Cffi-J

Italy, situated to the E. of Etruria. and ex*:

from the valley of the Tiber to the shor*-? aS tkc A o-

atic. The name was. however, at different p<rv»i

applied within very different limits. Un>bria, pr perit

so called, may be considered as extendiac aaiv t-m

the Tiber, which formed its W. limit thr^p

greater part of its course, and separated U'librjfr-e

Etruria, to the great central ranee of the Awn-na

frorn the sources of the Tiber in the X. to t^* i/-*o

delta Sibilla in the S. But on th» csiw

of 111is range, sloping duwn to the Adriatic ^a. ^

extensive and fertile district extendm^ fra *i?

frontiers of Picenum to the neighbourhood of Ara.-

num, which had probably been at «ie tune ai»o *•

cupied bv the Umbrians, but. before it *;t»*i."*» a

Roman history, had been conquered by the Gaftji

tribe of the Senones. Hence, after the exprjl-* 2 i

these invaders, it became known to the Bocia a

'■ Gallicus ac:er," and is alwaja so texnwd »j

rians in reference to tlie eariier period of £cu

history. (Liv. xxiii. 14, xxxix. 44; Cie. BsL ii,

&c.) On the division of Italy into resi*» 5f

Augustus, this distinct was again nnirtd

Umbria, both being included in the Sisxh T»r:

(Plin. iii. 14. s. 19.) But even Pliny, in iicscr^r

this union, distinguishes the ** ager Gali>ca»* irm

Umbria Proper ('* Jungitur his sexta recio i'mina*

complexa agrumque Gallicum cirra Ariming».*/i-1-

it is evident therefore that the name of Um.VaAi

not at that time in common usa^e include the nr.-

tory on the shores of the Adriatic la Lie -iss*

Ptolemy deficnates the coast from Ancom to Anc-

num (termed by Pliny the "Gallica ora") aa "Bi

land of the Senones" (Ptol. iii. 1. § 22), 1 n

which had certainly become inapprcjjnate ; -rj *' "*

his time. It was according to Piiny (L c) po­

tion of the Gaulish territory which *x? ?r-?="T

designated aa Gallia Togala, a name afirr«ra

extended and applied to the whole of CiAiia

Gaul. (Uirt. B. G. viii. 24; Cic PkiL vn. d.aci

It was not, therefore, till u late period tbit rs»sx3»

of Umbria came into cenerxl n>e as iDoiu:- ^ H
