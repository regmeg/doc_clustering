STLACE'NAE, a place in Lower Pannonia, on

the south of Lake Peiao. (/(. Ant. p. 233, where

it appears in the ablat. form Silacenis). lis exact

site is unknown. [L. S.]

SlLANA, a town in the NW. of Thessaly, near

the frontiers of Athamania, mentioned along with

Gompbj and Trice* bj Livy, Leake conjectures

that it occupied the site of Poluinn, near which are

several squared blocks of ancient workmanship.

p. 5*29.)

SI'LARUS(XiKapoi, Vtol-^tKaph, Strab.:&2e)f

a considerable river of Southern Italy, flowing into

the gulf of Posidonia, and forming the boundary

between Campania and Lucania. It rises in the

mountains near Teora, on the confines of the Hir-

pini, ami not far from the sources of the Aufidus;

thence flows for some distance in a southerly direction

till it receives the waters of the Tanager (Tanagro),

ii considerable stream, which joins it from the SE.;

it then turns to the SW. and pursues that direction

to the sea, winch it enters about 5 miles to the N.

of the city of Paestutn. About 5 miles from its

mouth it receives another important tributary in the

Calor (Colore), which joins it from the S. Between

the Calor and Tanager, on the S. bank of the Silarns

rises the mountain group of Mount Alburuus, men­

tioned by Virgil in connection with that river. The

luci Silari" of the same author are evidently the

same with the extensive woods which still clothe the

valley of the IStle from its confluence with the

Tanagro to within a few miles of the sea. (Virg.

Georg. iii. 146.) The Silarns was in the days of

Strabo and Pliny the recognised boundary between

Campania (including under that name the land of

the Picentini) and Lucania; but this applies only to

its course near its mouth, as Eburi (Eboli), though

situated to the N. of it, is included by Pliny among

the towns of Lucania. (Strab. v. p. 251, vi. p. 252;

Plin. iii. 5. ss. 9, 10, 11.s. 15; Ptol. iii. 1. § 8; Wei.

ii. 4. §9; Tub. Tent..; Dionys. Per. 361.) A pecu­

liarity of its wuters, mentioned by several ancient

writers, is that they had the power of petrifying

sticks, leaves, anil other substances immersed in

them. (Strab. v. p. 251; Plin, ii. 103. s. 106; Sil.

Ital. viiL 582.)

The name is written by Lncrm and Columella

Siler, and the same form is found in Vibius Sequester,

indicating an approach to the modern name of Stle.

(Luean, ii. 426 ; Colum. x. 136; Vib. Seq. p.

18.) [K.H.B.]

SILAS (SiM'/s, Arrian, Ind, c. 6; Strab. xv. p.

703; Diod. ii. 37), a river of the Upper Punjab,

the story of which, as told by ancient writers, is

clearly fabulous. According to Arrian and others,

the water of this river was so light that nothing

could swim in it. Lassen, who has examined this

story witli his usual acutcness, has shown from the

Miihabhi'trntn that there was a stream in the nor­

thern part of India called the SUa, the water of

which was endowed with a highly pctrifving power,

from which circumstance the river obtained its sig­

nification, Situ meaning in Sanscrit a stone.

(Zttochr. f. /funds des Morgenlands, ii. p. 63.)

It may be remarked that the name occurs differently

written. Thus Diodorus writes XiWav iroTafidv;

Antigonus Xt\av Kp-n^qr. {Mirab. c. 161.) Pliny

evidently refers to the same story, but tails the river
