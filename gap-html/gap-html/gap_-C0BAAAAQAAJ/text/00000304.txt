MARSYAS. MARTYROPOLIS.

Idrias, that is in the neighbourhood of Stratoniccia,

and flowing in a nortu-wi\>terti direction pa>t Ala-

banda, discharged its waters into the Maeander

nearly opposite to Trallcs. On its banks were the

\(VKoi (TTJjAoi, near which the Carians held their

national meetings. (Herod, v. 118.) The modern

name of this river is Tsh'tna, as is clearly proved

by Leake {Asia Minor, p. 234, &c); while earlier

geographers generally confound this Marsyas with

the Harpasus.

2. A small river of Phrygia, and, like the Carian

Marsyas, a tributary of the Maeander. Herodotus

(vii 20) calls it a KarappdicTtfS; and according to

Xcnophon (Anab. i. 2. § 8) its sources were in the

market-place of Celaenae, beluw the acropolis, where

it fell down with a great noise from the rock (Curt,

iii. 1.) Tliis perfectly agrees with the term applied

to it by Herodotus; but the description is apparently

opposed to a statement of Pliny (v. 41), accord­

ing to whom the river took its origin in the valley

of Aulocrene, ten miles from Apamea. (Coinp.

Strab. xii. p. 578; Max. Tyr. viii. 8.) Strabo,

again, states that a hike above Celaenae was the

source of bulb the Maeander and the Marsyas.

"Comparing these accounts," says Col, Leake

(Asia Minor, p. 160), " with Uvy (xxxviii. 38),

who probably copied from Polybius, it may be in­

ferred that the lake or pool on the summit of a

mountain which rose above Celaenae was the reputed

source of the Marsyas and Maeander; but that in

fact the two rivers issued from different parts of the

mountain below the lake." By this explanation the

diihVulty of reconciling the different statements seems

to he removed, for Aulocrene was probably the name

of the lake, which imparted its own name to the plain

mentioned by Pliny, The Marsyas joined the Mae­

ander a little way below Celaenae. (Comp. Maeax-

i»lk; and Hamilton's Researdtes, i. p. 499.) [L.S.]

MA US V AS (Ma.'ai'us).a river of Coelesyria, men­

tioned only by l'liny (v. 23) as dividing Apameia

from the tetrarchy of the Xazerini. It was probably

the river mentioned—without its name—by Abulfeda

as a tributary of the Orontes, which, rising below

Apameia, falls into the lake synonymous with that

city, and so joins the Orontes. The modern name

Yarmttk is given by Pocoeke, who places it in his

map oil the east of the Orontes, (Abulfeda, Tabula

St/riae,ed. Kochler, pp. 151, 152; Pococke,Descrip­

tion oj'Ote East, vol. ii. p. 79.) It doubtless gave

its name to Marsyas, a district of S) ria, mentioned by

Strabo, who joins it with Ituraea, and defines its

situation by the following notes:—It adjoined the

Macra Campus, on its eaat, and had its commence­

ment at Laodiceia ad Libanum. Chaleis was, as it

were, an acropolis of the district. This Chaleis is

joined with Heliopolis, as under the power of Ptolemy,

son of Mennaeus, who ruled over Marsyas and Itu-

raea. (Strab. xvi. pp. 753, 755.) The same geo-

L'i apher speaks of Chalcidice ano tov Map-rvov Kadi}-

novia(\>. 153), and extends it to the sources of the

Orontes, above which was the AiiKccf fictJiXitcos

(p. 155), now the Befoul. From these various

notices it is evident that the Mar.-yas comprehended

the valley of the Orontes from its rise to Apameia,

where it was bounded on the north probably by the

river of the same name. But it extended westward

to the Macra Campus, which bordered on the Medi­

terranean. (Mannert, Geographic van Syrien,

pp. 326. 363.) [Ituuaea; Oku.ntes.] [GAY.]

Strabo (// Kifitnj SiraOTa. xi. p. 523). St. Mitfm

(Man. snr fAr/nenie, vol. i. p. 57) has ingeniously

conjectured that the name Spauta lhat is applied li>

it in our MSS. of Strabo, is an error of some copynl

for Caputa, a word which answers to the Armcuun

Gahoid and Persian Kabud, signifying " blue," a&i

which, in allusion to the colour of the water, is tt.t
