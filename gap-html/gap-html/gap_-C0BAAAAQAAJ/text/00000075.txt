II, iii. 6. iv. 28, 34.) The Jerusalem Itinerary

plates the station of Intercisa 9 M. P. from Calles

{Cngliy, and the same distance from Forum Sem-

prouii (Fasjombrone), both of which distances are

just about correct. (D'Anville, Analyse de tltalie,

INTERNUM MAKE, the great inland or Medi­

terranean Sea, which washes the coasts of Southern

Europe, Northern Africa, and Asia Minor.

1. Name.— In the Hebrew Scriptures, this sea, on

the W. of Palestine, and therefore behind a person

facing the E., is called the "Hinder Sea"(ZJ«it. xi.

24: J'jcU ii. 20), and also the " Sea of the Philis­

tines '(Exod, xxii. 81), because that people occupied

tlie largest portion of its shores. Pre-eminently it

was " the Great Sea " (.Yum. xxxiv. 6, 7; Josh. i. 4,

ii. 1, xr. 47; Ezek. xlvii. 10, 15, 20), or simply

"the Sea" (1 Kings, v. 9; comp. 1 Mace. xiv. 34.

x». 11). In the same way, the Homeric poems,

Hesiod, the Cyclic poets, Aeschylus, and Pindar,

call it emphatically "the Sea." The logograplier

Herataeus speaks of it as " the Great Sea " (/>. 349,

ei. Klaoscn). Nor did the historians and systematic

geographers mark it off by any peculiar denomination.

The Roman writers call it Make Internum (Pomp.

lleia, i. 1. § 4; Plin. iii. 3) or Istestinum (Sail.

Jug. 17; Klor. iv. 2; y fau> SdAaTTa, Polyb. iii. 39;

V irrit ddA., Strab ii. p. 121, iii. p. 139; v imbs

'UpaiAtimr an)Am* daA., Arist. Met. ii. 1), or more

frnjoently, Mark Nostrum (Sail. Jug. 17, 18;

Caes. B.G. v. 1; Liv. xxvi. 42; Pomp. Mela, i. 5. § 1;

jj tin' 'hilo.% 3oIa., Strab. ii. p. 121). The epithet

'•-Mediterranean ** is not used in the classical writers,

ind was first employed for this sea by Solinos (c. 22;

comp. Isid. Origr. xiii. 16). The Greeks of the pre­

sent Jay call it tlie " White Sea " ('Ao-uoi 8dAairo-a),

t.i ilL-tinjui-h it from the Black Sea. Throughout

Europe il is kno-wn as the Mediterranean.

2. Extent, Shape, and Admeasurements.— The

Mediterranean Sea extends from 6° W. to 36° E. of

linwiwich, while the extreme limits of its latitude

are from 30° to 46° N-; and, in round numbers, its

Itiurtb, from Gibraltar to its furthest extremity in

Syria, is about 2000 miles, with a breadth varying

horn 80 to 50O miles, and, including the Euxine,

vith a line of shore of 4500 leagues. The ancients,

*ho considered this sea tu be a very large portion  
fi the globe, though in reality it is only equal to

«*--*venlcenth part of the Pacific, assigned to it

a much greater length. As they possessed no means

tut critically measuring horizontal angles, and wore

unaided by the compass and chronometer, correctness

io great distances was unattainable. On this account,

ifuiic the E. shores of the Mediterranean approached

a ti.lcr.ible decree of correctness, the relative positions

awl firms of the W. coasts arc erroneous. Strabo,

a philosophical rather than a scientific geographer,

•et himself to rectify the errors of Eratosthenes (ii.

pp. 105, 106), but made more mistakes: though he

lire-* a much better " contour" of the Mediterranean,

}t\ In: distorted the W. parts, by placing Massilia

131° to the S. of Byzantium, instead of 2^° to the

X. of uat city. Ptolemy also fell into great errors,

i'kIi as the nattening-in of the N. coast of Africa, to

the amount of 4^° to the S., in the latitude of Car­

thage, while Byzantium was placed 2° to the N. of

b» true position; thus increasing the breadth in the

v-ry part where the greatest accuracy might be ex-

p^iej. Nor was this all; for the extreme length of

li* Internal Sea was carried to upwards of 20°

beyond its true limits. The maps of Agathodaemon

which accompany the Geography of Ptolemy, though

indifferently drawn, preserve a much better outline of

this sea than is expressed in the Theodosian or

Peutingerian Table, where the Mediterranean is so

reduced in breadth as to resemble a canal, and the

site, form, and dimensions of its islands are displaced

and disfigured.

The latitudes were estimated by the ancient ob­

servers in stadia reckoned from the equator, and are

not so discordant as might be expected from sucli a

method. The length between the equinoctial line

and Syracuse, or rather the place which they called

the "Strait of Sicily," is given as follows: —

Stadia

Eratosthenes - - - - 25,450

Hipparchus - - - - 25,600

Strabo 25,400

Marinas of Tyre - - - 26,075

Ptolemy .'-.-. 26,833

Their longitudes run rather wild, and are reckoned

from the '; Sacrum Promontorium" ( Cape St. Vin­

cent), and the numbers given are as the arc from

thence to Syracuse:—

Stadia

Eratosthenes - - - - 11,800

Hipparchus .... 16,300

Strabo 14,000

Marinus of Tyre - - - 18,583

Ptolemy 29,000

In Admiral Smyth's work {The Mediterranean,

p. 375) will be found a tabular view of the above-

mentioned admeasurements of the elder geographers,

along with the determination resulting from his own

observations; assuming, for a reduction of the num­

bers, 700 stadia to a degree of latitude, for a plane

projection in the 36° parallel, and 555 for the cor­

responding degree of longitude. (Comp. Gosselin,

Geographie des Grecs, 1 vol. Paris, 178(3; Geogra­

phic des Anciens, 3 vols. Paris, 1813; Mesures

Itincraires, 1 vol. Paris, 1813.)

3. J'hysical Geography. — A more richly-varied

and broken outline gives to the N. shores of the

Mediterranean an advantage over the S. or Libyan

coast, which was remarked by Eratosthenes. (Strab.

ii. p. 109.) The three great peninsulas, — the

Iberian, the Italic, and tho Hellenic, — with their

sinuous and deeply indented shores, form, iti com­

bination with the neighbouring islands and opposite

coasts, many straits and isthmuses. Exclusive of

tho Euxinc (which, however, must be considered as

]art of it), this sheet of water is naturally divided

into two vast basins; the barrier at the entrance of

the straits marks the commencement of the \V.

basin, which descends to an abysmal depth, and

extends as far as the central part of the sea, where

it flows over another barrier (the subaqueous Ad­

venture Bank, discovered by Admiral Smyth), and

again falls into the yet unfathomed Levant basin.

Strabo (ii. pp. 122—127) marked off this expanse

by three smaller closed basins. The westernmost,

or Tyrrhenian basin, comprehended the space be­

tween the Pillars of Hercules and Sicily, including

the Iberian, Ligurian, and Sardinian seas; the

waters to the W. of Italy were also called, in re­

ference to the Adriatic, the " Lower Sea," as that

gulf bore the name of the '* Upper Sea." The

second was the Syrtic basin, E. of Sicily, including

the Ausoniun or Siculian, the Ionian, and the Libyan

seas: on the N. this basin runs up into the Adriatic,

on the S. the gulf of Libya penetrates deeply into
