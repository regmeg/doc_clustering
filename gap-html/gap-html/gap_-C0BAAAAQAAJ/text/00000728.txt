642 PLIXTHINE.

Pi

remains within the ruined walls are a theatre about

100 feet in diameter, and above it a cistern, 100 feet

Ion?, 70 broad, and 14 deep, excavated on three

sides in the ruck, and on the fourth constructed of

masonry. In the acropolis Leake discovered some

remains uf Doric shafts of white marble, which lie

conjectures to have belonged to the temple of Athena,

of which Dicaearchus speaks (1. 55); but the

temple mentioned by Dicaearchus must have been

at Old l'leuron, since Dicaearchns was a contem­

porary of Aristotle and Theophrxstus, and could not

have been alive at the time of the foundation of New

l'leuron. I)odwell, who visited the ruins of this

city, erroneously maintains that they are those of

Oeniadae, which were, however, situated among the

marshes on the other side of the Achelous. Leake

phn-es Old l'leuron further south, at a site called

Ghttfto-kastro, on the edge of the plain of Meso-

Itrngkif where there are a few Hellenic remains.

PLIXTHINE (IUivftyn, Strab. xvii p. 799;

Ptnl. iv. 5. § 8; Steph. B. s. p.), the frontier town

of Aepypt towards Libya. It .stood at the head of

the Plinthinetic bay, in latitude 29° 40' N., just

within the Mareotic nome, but beyond the limits of

the Delta proper. There are no remains enabling us

to determine the exact site of this town; but it can­

not have been far from Taposiris (Abousir\ of which

the ruins are still visible about 25 miles W. of

Alexandria. An inferior kind of wine was pro­

duced in this region of Aegypt; and Hellanicus (/V.

155) says that the people of Plinthine originally

discovered the virtues of the grape. (Athen. i.

p. 34.) [W. B. !>.]

PMNTHINETICUS SINUS (Wareirfais

k6\WqS, Herod, ii. 6), the westernmost of the Medi­

terranean harbours of Aegypt. It was indeed little

more than a roadstead, and was exposed to the N.

PLISTIA (Prett'ui), a town of the Samnites,

mentioned only by Livy (ix. 21, 22) in a manner

that affords but little clue to its position. It was

besieged by the Sammies in n. c. 315, with the view

of drawing ofl* the lionians from the siege of Saticula:

they failed in this object, but made themselves

masters of PlUtia. The site is probably indicated

by a village still called Prist in t about 4 miles from

Sta Agata dti Goti, at the foot of the Monte 7a-

bnrno. [K. H. B.]

PLITENDUS, a town of Phrygia on the river

PLITHANA (Ttt riAi'(ioi'a, Arrian, Per. Mar.

Erythr. p. 29, Huds., p. 294, ed. C. Miiller. who

reads Ylaidava), an important emporium in the

Dachinabades in India, from which many onyx stones

were exported. It is called by Ptolemy (vii. I. § S2)

Baethana (RaiBava), the royal residence of Siro-

ptolemaetis. In Pracrit it is also called Puithana, in

Sanscrit Prathhthana; it is the modern town of

Python, or Pultannh upon the river tnxlanri.
