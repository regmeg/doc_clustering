*16 RHOSCOPUS.  
RHYNDACUS.

Gulf in lat. 29° 20', long. 48° 25' E. It was little

better than a torrent, ami is now doubtless marked

by tlie present Bender-rik. Ptolemy (vi. 4. § 2)

and Ammianus (xxiii. 0) call it Rhocnmanis ('Po-

yondvts), ami Marcianus (Pcripl. i. § 24, ed Muller)

Rhogomanius {'Poyo^dytos). (Vincent, vol. i. p.

401; Tlievenot, v. p. .535.) [V.]

RHOSCOPUS ('PotTKotrovi), a place on the

coast of Pamphylia, near the month of the Cc-

stni-s is mentioned only in the Stadiasmns (§§ 199,

20<O. [L.S.]

RHOSOLOGIACUM or RHOSOLOGIA ('Po<ro-

\oyia), a small place in the country of the Tecto-

sa:;es in Galatia, on the road from Ancyra to Cae-

sareia Mazaea, not far from the river Halys. (It.

Ant. pp. 143, 201) ; Ptol. v. 4. § 8, where some

read 'OpiffuAoyia or 'O^ocroKayiaKov; It. Ilieros.

p. 575, where it is called Rosolodiaeum.) [L. S.]

RHOSUS. [Issrs.]

RHOXOLA'Xl. [Roxot.ani.]

RHUANA ('Poi/dva al. 'PdSava $acrl\ftoy), an

inland town of Arahia, placed by Ptolemy (vi. 7.

§ 33) in lonp. 87°. lat. 22°. Apparently not far

distant from the SW. bay of the Persian Gulf, and

on the river Lar. [CI. W ]

RHUBON, RHl'DON (PovGwos 1kG.. Ptol. jij.

5. i$ 2; 'Povbuii'as Marcian. Jleracl. Ptrtpl.

§ 39, ed. Miiller), a river of European Sarmaiia

which took its source in the Alani Monies and

discharged itself into tiic Venedicus Sinus. Scha-

farik (Slav. Alt. vol. i. p. 4i»7) has identified it

with the Ih'tna, which, taking a direction generally

W., falls into the Gulf of Riga below Fort l>una-

munde, after a course of 655 miles. This same

ethnologist connects the mythic Eridanus, and tlie

trees that wept amber, with tlit? Rhudon of Mar­

cian (Rhubon appctis to In- a corrupted form),

which Sabinus, a commentator upon Virpl, a. i>.

1544, calls lihodanus. The amber could be brought

by land, or by water from the coasts where it was

collected to the Diina, and thence by boats con­

veyed to the Bory.sthenes and the coasts of the

En Nine. The name *' Eri-danus," closely con­

nected with Rhodanus, is composed of the words

'• Rha" and "Don,'* roots which, in several of the In­

do-European languages, signify " water,"1 *; river," as

for instance in '* Rha," the old n:tme for the Volga,

and Danubius, Tanais, Danapris, Danastris, and

the like. [E. B. J.]

RHUBRICATUS (PoufyUaTos, Ptol. iv. 3. § 5),

a river of Numidia,. the same as tlie Luis of the

Pent. Tab., whu h flowed 5 M.P. to the E. of Hippo

Renins, now called the Sttboute (Barth, Waiuier-

unffen. p. 70). [E. B. J.]

RHU'DIAE or RU'DIAE ('PouSi'a, Ptol; 'P*5fai,

Strab.: Eth. Rudinus: Rugge), an ancient city of

the Salentines, in the interior of the Roman province

of Calabria, and in tiie immediate vicinity of Lupiae

(Lecce). (Strab. vi.p.281: Ptol.iii. l.§ 76.) Strabo

calls it a Greek city (ttoAis 'EaatjWs); but we have

no other indication of this fact, and all the other

notices we find of it would lead u.s to infer that it

was a native Salentine or Messapian town. Under

the Romans it appears to have enjoyed municipal

rank (an inscription has '; Municipes Rudini," Orell.

3858); hut in other respects it was a place of little

importance, arid derived its sole celebrity from the

circumstance of its heint; the birthplace of tlie poet

Ennius. (Strab. I.e. Mel. ii. 4. § 7; Sil. Ital. xii.

393; Cic. t/r Or. iii. 42.) That author is repeatedly

termed a Calabrian (Hor. Cam*, iv. 8; Ovid. A. A.

iii. 409; Sil. Ital. I.e.; Acron, ad Hor. I r). nl

these passages confirm the accuracy of Pu* y.

who assigns Rhudiae to the Salentines, it>i thfrrf-^

to tlie Calabrians according- to the Roman as* <i '.'v

name. Pliny and Mela, on tlie contrary, etriTi-n'f

Rudiae among the towns of the Pedicuh uteia

witli Barium and Egnatia, and the latter rubor ti-

pressly excludes it from Calabria (Plin. hi. 11. a. 16;

Mel. /. c ). But it seems impassible to TK&n> f^.i

statement with that of Strabo, who pUees i: &u

Lnpiae, in the interior of the peninsula, or

actual situation of Rudiae, which is clearly Mmti^c

at a place still called Rugge.though n<iw aninhabfift

about a mile from Lecce, where the inscnp^Ti

cited was discovered, as well as several <<li#r> in tb

Messapian dialect, and many vases and other ^-f'^

of antiquity. The identity of this place will '»

municipal town of Rudiae can thermion? adnu; •*»

doubt ; nor is there any reason to question the tn".

that this was also tlie birthplace of Ennia: fee

considerable confusion has ansen from th# rrr:ne

in the Tabula of a place called u Radae," a

{daces 12 miles W. of Rubi, on the road to Ci:.c;cr^-

As this place would have been within tbe am"? s

the Pediculi or Peucetii, it has been supps*:

some writers to be the same with the Rikiia* a Tjsi

and Mela, and therefore the birthplace A trx>fe;

but tlie claims of Rugge to this distun-two 4>«r

unquestionable. (Galateo, de Sil. layyy. y>Tt\ fc*1

manelli, vol. ii. pp. 93 —102; Mouunata,

Ital DiaUkte, p. 58.)

Tlie Rudae or Rudiae of the Tabula, *fc^>"

otherwise quite unknown, must have been at=*»i

somewhere in tlie neighbourhuod of tbe nM»n

Andria. [LE-tj

RHUTUPIAE [Ki:Ti-riAE.]

RHY'MMICI M0NTES ( Pvu^itA i^-

The river Rhtmkvs ('Pf^Luit *0T0»uis,Pti H

RHY'NDACUS ('PuvSoitof), an impoctial

cording to Pliny, it was at one time c*U»i L««>
