1304 V1A SALARIA- VIA SALARIA.

ficiently account for the one appellation hiving be­

come merged in the oilier. A continuation of the

same road, which was also included under the name

of the Via Fiaenestina, was carried from the foot

of the hill at Praeneste, through the subjacent

plain, till it fell into the Via Latina, just below

Anaunia.

The stations on it mentionedin the Antonine Itine­

rary (p.302) are:—

From Rome to Gabii - - - - xii. M.r.

Praeneste - - - xi.

Sub Anagnia - - xxiv.

The Tabula gives the same distances as far as

Praeneste, which are very nearly correct. Strabo

reckons it 100 stadia (12| miles) from Rome to

Gabii, and the same distance thence to Praeneste.

The continuation from Praeneste to Sub Anagnia is

given only in the Antonine Itinerary, but the dis­

tance is overstated; it docs not really exceed 18

miles.

The Via Praenestina issued from the Porta Esqui-

lina at Rome, together with the Via Labicana (Strab,

v. p. 237): it passed through the Porta Praenestina

in the later circuit of the walls, now called Porta

Maygwre; and separated from the Via Labicana im- I

mediately afterwards, striking off in a nearly direct

line towards Gabii. About 3 miles from Rome it

passed the imperial villa of the Gordians, the mag­

nificence of which is extolled by Julius Capitol inns

(Gordian. 32), and is still in some degree attested

by the imposing and picturesque ruins at a spot

called Torre cki Schiavi. (Nibby, Dintorni, vol. iii.

pp.707—710.) Nine miles from Rome the road

is carried over the valley of a small stream by a

viaduct of the most massive construction, still known

as the Potite di Nona: and 3 miles farther it

passes the still existing ruins of the city of Gabii.

Thence to Praeneste the line of the road was not

so direct : this part of the Campagna being in­

tersected by deep gullies and ravines, which necessi­

tated some deviations from the straight line. The

road is however clearly marked, and in many

places retains its ancient pavement of basaltic lava.

It is carried nearly straight as far as a point about 5

miles beyond Gabii, where it passes through a deep

cutting in the tufo rock, which lias given to the spot

the name of Cavamonte : shortly afterwards it turns

abruptly to the right, leaving the village of Gallicana

(the probable site of Pedum) on the left, and

thence follows the line of a long narrow ridge be­

tween two ravines, till it approaches the city of

Praeneste. The highroad doubtless passed only

through the lower part of that city. Portions of the

ancient pavement may be seen shortly after quitting

the southern gate {Porta del Sole), and show that

the old road followed the same direction as the

modern one, which leads through Cart and Puliuno,

to an inn on tlie highroad below Anagni, apparently

on the veiy same site as the station Sub Anagnia

(or Compitum Anagninum, as it is called in another

route) o! the Itinerary.

VIA SALAUIA (j) 'S.aXapia dooy, Strab.), one of

the most ancient and well-known of the highroads

of Italy, which Jed from Rome up the valley of the

'l iber, and through the land of the Sabiues to Reate,

and thence across the Apennines into Picenum,

and to the shores of the Adriatic. We have no

account of the period of its construction as a regular

road, but there can be little doubt that it was a lie-

quented route of communication Iocs before a *"is

laid down as a regular highway : and the tri-4c-*i

that its name was derived from it* be~*;* usea tr

the Sabines to carry into their owo etrtiEtry *i»

salt that they obtained from the Ro-tnan *-ilt-*vi3

at the mouth of the Tiber, in itself sftto tt> po-i

indeed, with the exception of the Via La'.iza. Ljt

only one of the great Roman highways, lie ca-i

of which was not derived from that of its Cri

constructor. But it cannot be inferred frcrn the ex­

pressions of Livy that the battle of the XL* *i«

fought" ad undecimum lapidem," aod thai the tiau

on a subsequent occasion encamped "ad len»

lapidem via Salaria trans pontem Anienis" (Lrr. r

37, vii. 9), that the regular n-.ad w*s tb. ~ r ex­

istence, though there is no doubt that ther* «x- t

of the Sabines. We learn from the latter

that a bridge had been already constructed cfw L*

Anio; and it is probable that the Via Saurii nt

constructed in the first instance only as far a* t&a.

and was not carried acr es the mountains ud >~-Z

afterwards. Even in the time of Strabo tbm a t?

evidence that it reached to the Adnata:

improbable that it had then been carried to

Upper Sea. But the Itineraries pre the raiw t

Castrum Truentinurn on the Adriatic, and ti=u

to Adria.

The Salarian Way issued from the Porta C*^m

of the ancient city together with the Via N*r«^a

(Strab. I c; Feat. $. r. Solaria); bet ti-y C-

verged immediately afterwards, so that tbf t»

quitted the outer circuit of the city (as b:r«a**

by the walls of Aurelian) through the Pra

Salaria, the other through the Porta K trw-raca

Between 2 and 3 miles from Rome the Va

crossed the Anio by a bridge, cali-d itf i' =s
