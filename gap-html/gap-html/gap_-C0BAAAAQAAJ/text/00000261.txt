MAEATAE (MeudVai), a general name given by

Dion Cassius (lxxv. 5, lxxvi. 12) to the British

tribes nearest to the Roman vallum, the Caledouii

dwelling beyond them. (Comp. Jornandes, de Rtb.

Get. c. 2.)

MAEDI (Maioof, M«r5oi, Thuc, n. 98; Polyb. x.

41). a powerful people in the west of Thrace,

dwelling near the sources of the Axius and Margus,

and upon the southern slopes of Mt. Scomius.

(Leake, Nortliern Greece, vol. iii. p. 472.) Strabo

says that the Maedi bordered eastward on the Thu-

natae of Dardania (vii. p. 316), and that the Axius

flowed through their territory (vii. p. 331). The

latter was called Maedica (MaiiiKt), Ptol. iii. 11.

§ 9; Liv. xxvi. 25, xl. 22). They frequently made

incursions into Macedonia ; but in B.C. 211, Philip

V. invaded their territory, and took their chief town

Iamphorina, which is probably represented by Vranid

or Irorina, in the upper valley of the Margus or

Morara. (Liv. xxvi. 25.) We also learn from Livy

(xl. 22) that the same king traversed their territory

in order to reach the summit of Mt. Haemus; and

that on his return into Macedonia he received the

submission of Petm, a fortress of the Maedi. Among

the other places in Maedica, we read of l'hragandae

(Lir. xxvi. 25) and Desudaba, probably the modern

Ktimanoco, on one of the confluents of the upper

Axius. (Liv. xliv. 26.) The Maedi are said to have

been of the same race as the Bithynians in Asia, and

were hence called Maedobithyni (Steph. B. *. v.

MaiSoi ; Strab. vii. p. 295). (Comp. Strab. vii.

p. 316; Plin. iv. 11. s. 18.)

MAENACA (Mcm-dmi), a Greek city on the S.

coast of Hispania Baetica, the most westerly colony

of the Phucaeans. (Strab. iii. p. 156; Scymn. 145, et

seq.) In Strabo's time it had been destroyed; but the

ruins were still visible. He refutes the error of those

who confoundi*d it with Malaca, which was not a

Greek, but a Phoenician city, and lay further to the

W.; but this error is repeated by Avienus (Or.

Slnrit. 426, et seq.). The place seems to be the

Mate) of Stephanus. [P. S.]

MAE'NALUS. 1. (MaimKos, Strab. viii. p. 388;

Schol. ad Apoll. RkotL i. 769; Maii'aAoi', Theocr. i.

123; to MatrdAior 6/wj, Pans. viii. 36. § 7; Mae-

nalus, Virg. Eel. viii. 22; Mel. ii. 3; Plin. iv. 6.

s. 10; Maenala, pi., Virg. Eel. x. 55; Ov. Met. i.

216), a lofty mountain of Arcadia, forming the

western boundary of the territories of Mantincia and

Tegea. It was especially sacred to the god Pan,

who is hence called Maenalim Deta (Ov. Faff. iv.

650.) The inhabitants of the mountain fancied

that they had frequently heard the god playing on

his pipe. The two highest summits of the moun­

tain are called at present Aidin and Apano-Khripa:

the latter is 5115 feet high. The mountain is at

present covered with pines and firs; the chief pass

through it is near the modern town of Tripolitza.

—The Roman poets frequently use the adjectives

Maenalvis and Maenalis as equivalent to Arcadian.

Hence Maenalii verstu. shepherds' songs, such us

were usual in Arcadia (Virg. EcL viii.21); Maenalis

ora,i.e. Arradia(Ov. Font. iii.84); Maenalunympha,

i. e. Camienta (Ov. Fait. i. 634); Maenalii Urta,

and Maenalia A retot, the constellation of the Bear,

into which Callisto, daughter of Lycaon, king of

Arcadia, was said to have been metamorphosed. (Ov.

Tritt. iii. 11. 8, Fast. ii. 192.)
