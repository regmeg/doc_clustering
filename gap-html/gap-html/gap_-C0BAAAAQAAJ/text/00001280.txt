THU'RIUM. TBoeotia, p. 412, b.]

TUVA'MIA. [Pnuus, p. G02, b.]

TUY'AMIS (Qva^is), a river of Epeirus, flowing

into the sea. near a promontory of the same name.

(Ptol. iii, 14. *;§ 4, 5.) It formed the northern

boundary of Thesprotia, which it sejiarated from

Cestrine, a district of Chaonia (Thue. i. 46; Strab.

vii. p. 324; Paus. i. 11. § 2; Cic. ad Att vii. 2, dt

Leg. ii. 3: Pliu. iv. 1.) It is now called A'o-

htiati, apparently from the larpe reeds and aquatic

plants which ^row upon one of its principal tribu­

taries. Its ancient name seems to have been derived

from the bva or juniper, which, Leake informs us,

though not abundant near ihe sources of the river,

is common in the woody hills which border the

middle of its course. Tho historian Phylarehus

reUted (op. A then. iii. p. 73) that the Egyptian

bean, which grew only in marshy places and nowhtre

but in lv_rypt, once grew for a short time upon the

b.mks of the Thy amis, (Leake, Northern Greece,

vol. i. p. 103, vol. iv. p. 97.)

THY'AMUS (0ucy4O5), a mountain lying to the

S. of Argos Aniphilocbicum, identified by Leake with

Spartoeuni. (Time. iii. 10G; Leake, Northern

Greece, vol. iv. p. 251.)

THYATEIRA (tA BvdreLpa: Eth.Svar§ipijy6i)i

a considerable city in the north of Lydia, ou the

river Lycus, and on the road leading from Sardes in

the .south to Genna in the north. It was anciently

called Pelopeia, Enhippa, and Semiramis. (PUn. v.

31; Steph. H.s. v. Ovdrttpa.) Strabo (xiii. p. 625)

calls it a Macedonian colony, which probably means

only that during the Macedonian period it was in­

creased and embellished, for Stephanus B., admitting

that it previously existed under other names, relates

that Seleucua Nicator gave it ihe name of Thyga-

teira or Thyateira ou being informed that a daughter

(0i/7aT7jft) was born to him. But whatever we may

think of this etymology, it seems clear that the place

w;is not originally a Macedonian colony, but hail

existed long before under other names, and at one

]K.'riod belonged to Mysia. After the time of An-

tiochus Nuator, liowever, it became an important

place, and is often noticed in history. When the

twoScipios arrived in Asia on their expedition against

Antiochus the Great, the latter was encamped near

Thyateira, but retreated to Magnesia. (Liv. xxxvii.

8. 21. 37.) After the defeat of the Syrian king, the

town surrendered to the llomans. (Liv. xxxvii. 44;

Polyb. xvi. 1, xxxii, 25 ; comp. Appian, -Syr-. 30; Strab.

xiii. p. 646; Plut..SW/a, 15; Ptol. v. 2. § 16; It. Ant.

p. 336.) In Christian times Thyateira apj>ears as

one of the seven Cburchus in the AfKxalypse^ii. 18);

in the Acts of the Apostles (xvi. 14) mention is

made of one Lydia, a purple-seller of Thyateira, and

at a still later period we hear of several bishops whose

see it was. In the middle a^es the Turks changed

the name of the town into Akhissar, which it still

bears. (Mich. Due. p. 114.) Sir C. Fellows (Asui
