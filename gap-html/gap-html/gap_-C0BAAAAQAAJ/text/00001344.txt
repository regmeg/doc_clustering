1260 VATEDO. VEDIAXT1L

(Breton, Mem. de la Soci/te Rot/ale ties Antlquaires

de France, torn, xvi., quoted by Richard et Hoc-

quart. Guide du Yoyageur.} [G. L.]

VATEDO, in Gallia, mentioned in the Table,

is a place east of Bordeaux, supposed to be Va ires

on the left bank of the Dord/jgne, a branch of the

Garonne. [G. L.]

VATREXUS (Santerno), a river of Gallia

Cispadana, one of the southern tributaries of the

J'ad us. It had its sources in the Apennines, flowed

under the walls of Forum Cornelii (Wa), and

joined the southern branch of the Pad us (ttie

Spineticum Ostium) not far from its mouth, for

«hich reason the port at the entrance of that arm

,of the river was called the Tortus Vat rent. (Plin.

iii. 16. 8. 20.) The Santemn now flows into the

Po di Prinuiro (the modern representative of the

Spinetic branch), above 16 miles from its mouth:

hut the channels of both are in this part artificial.

In this lower part of its course it must always have

been more of a canal than a river, whence Martial

uses its name as typical of a sluggish stream.

(.Martial, iii. 67. 2.) * [E. H. B.]

UBERAE, a nation in India extra Gangern, men­

tioned by Pliny (vi. 19. s. 22). It possessed a large

town of the same name. It is not possible to deter­

mine its exact position; but. from the names of other

nations mentioned by Pliny in connection with the

Irl>erae, it is probable that this people lived near the

mouths of the Brahmaputra. [V-J

U'llII (OC€ioi), a German people who in Cae­

sar's time lived on the east bank of the Rhine and

opposite to the Treviri, for Caesar having made his

bridge in the country of the Treviri passed over into

the country of the Ubii. Owinc to their proximity

to the Rhine they were somewhat more civilised than

the other Germans, being much visited by mer­

chants and accustomed to Gallic manners (B. G.

it. 3, 18, vi. 29, 35). The Sigambri were the

neighbours of the Ubii on the north. The Suevi

were pressing the Ubii hard, when the Ubii applied

to Caesar for help: they gave him hostages, and

offered to supply him with a large number of boats

to cross the river, from which we may infer that they

were accustomed to navigate the Rhine. (B. G. iv.

16.) In the time of Augustus (Strab. iv. p. 194),

the nation crossed the Rhine, and Agrippa assigned

them lands on the west bank of the river, the policy

of the Romans being to strengthen the Rhenish

frontier ■gainst the rest of the Germans. (Tacit.

Germ. c. 28, Annai xii. 27; Sueton. Aug. c. 21.)

In the new territory of the Ubii was Colouia Agrip-

pina {Coin), and hence the people had the name of

A g rip pine uses, which was one of the causes why the

Germans east of the Rhine hated them. They

were considered as traitors to their country, who

had assumed a new name. (Tacit. Hist. iv. 2S.)

North of the Ubii on the west side of the Rhine

were the Gugerni [Gi'GKRNi]; and south of them

were the Treviri. [Colonia Agkippina; Ara

Pliny (iii. 20), and placed between the Meduli
