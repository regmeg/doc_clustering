this nor any other town existed in that district.

Pliny (vi. 3), on the other hand, speaks of Mclitene

as a town built by the fabulous queen Semi earn is

of Assyria; both accounts may be reconciled by the

.supposition that the aite of the town was fonnerly

occupied by some castle or fort, such as we know

to have cxibted in that country from early times.

(Strab. xii. p. 537.) The town was situated on the

hanks of a small tributary of the Euphrates, which

was not far distant from Mclitene, and in a very

salubrious district. During the first century of the

Christian era, the town was not of much importance

(Tac. Ann. xv. 26); but Trajxn raised it to the rank

of a £rcat city (Frocop. de Aedif. iii. 4), and thence­

forth it became a central point to which several

roads converged. {It. Ant pp. 157, 209, 211,

215.) The emperors Anastasius and Justinian

also embellished the place and surrounded it with

now walls. Ever since the reign of Titus, Melitene

had been the station of the famous Christian Legio

xii. fuluiinata; and after the division of Armenia

into two provinces, it became the capital of Armenia

Secunda. (Hieroel. p. 703; comp, Ptol. v. 7. § 5,

by the Byzantine writers. But at present it is in

ruins, though it still bears its ancient name in the

form of Malatia. [L. S.]

MEL1TONUS. a station on the Egnatian Way,

which the Jerusalem Itinerary places between He-

MELIZIUAKA (M*\i(uydpa, Arrian, Peripl

MELODU'NUM (Melon), a town of the .Secoea

in Gallia (B. G. vii. 58), on an island in tije So-

quana (Seine). Though the termination dun sceema

originally to liave signified a bill or height, it he-

came a part of the name of some tows*, which tka

Melodnnum were not situated on any elevatxa.

In tho Antonine Itinerary Melodunum appear* ane>r

the name Mecletum, and in the Table in the form

Meteglum. The distance from Lutetia in the Itioa.

is 17 or 18 Gallic leagues. From Melodunum to

Condate (Montereau-tur- Yonne) is 15 Gallic leagues

[Co.ndate, No, 2]. The old Celtic town on tte

island was replaced by a castle, of which there are

some remains. The present town of Melum is on

the right batik of the Seine, about 28 mile* from

Paris by the road.

In the text of Caesar (& G. rii. 58) there ia a

reading " qui Metiosedo," where the common reading

is " qui a Meloduno." The same variation oecars in

c, 60; and in c. 61 u Metiosedum versus" appear,

to be the received reading. A careful study of

Caesar will satisfy any person that Sltlun is ir^eaat

in all these passages, whether the true reading ia

Caesar's text is Melodunum, Metiosedum, or .on*,

thing else, Melodunum comes nearest to the modern

form. Walckenaer places Metiosedum at the con-

fluence of the Seine and ilarne. The varirty ia

the reading of this name appears also in the Itiaa,

as bhown above. The stratagem of I^b»enu« ce

the Seine (B. G. vii. 58, &C.) ia explained rn the

Aristotle (ap. I'iin. iv. 1^. s. 23; comp. S4eph. fiL

sea (x. p. 484). The latter writer say. (tc.) that

Melos was 700 stadia from the ppxiicnl.-rr lhc!y>-

Aristotle, it was also called Memblia by Ar.Ulo.
