1104 THESPIAE. THERV1NGL

rwv QepiitKwv gvvuSov to mean the assembly held at

Thermopylae.

Polybius's account of Philip's first invasion of

Aetolia, which resulted in the capture of Therraum,

supplies us with the chief information respecting

the towns in the central plain of Aetolia. Philip

set out from Limnaea, on the south-eastern comer

of the Anibraciot gulf, crossed the Achelous between

Stratus and Conope, and inarched with all speed

towards Thennum, leaving on his left Stratus Agri-

niuin, and Thesticnses (0e<rn*?i), and on his right

Conope. Lysimachia, Trichonium, and Phoeteum.

He thus arrived at Metapa, on the lake Trichonis,

and from thence marched to Thermus by the roiid

already mentioned, passing by Pampliia in his way.

He returned by tlie same road as far as Metapa,

hut from the latter place lie marched in one day to

a place called Acrae, where ho encamped, and on

the next day to Conope. After remaining a day at

Conope, he marched up the Achelous, and crossed it

near Stratus.

Tlie remains of tlie walls of Thennum show

that the city was about 2\ miles in circumference.

It was in the form of a triangle on the slope of

a pyramidal hill, bordered ou either side by a tor­

rent flowing in a deep ravine. The only remains

of a public edifice within the walls consist of a

square, pyramidal, shapeless mass of .stones. (Leake,

Northern Greece^ vol. i. p. 120, &c.)

» iry of lioeotia, situated at the foot of Jit. Helicon,

looking towards the south and the Crissaean gulf,

where stood its port-town Creusa or Creusis. (Strab.

ix. p. 40«.J; Paus. ix. 20. § G; Steph. B. s. v.)

Thespiae was said to have derived its name from

'1 hespia, a daughter of Asopus, or from Thespius,

a son ut Kicchtheus, who migrated from Alliens,

(l'aus. I. c, \ Diod. iv. 29.) The city is mentioned

in the catalogue of Homer. (//. ii. 41*8.) Thespiae,

like Plataea, was une of the Boeotian cities inimical

to Tliebes, which circumstance affected its whole

history. Thus Thespiae and Plataea were the only

two Boeotian cities that refused to give earth and

water to tlie heralds of Xerxes. (Herod, vii. 132.)

Seven hundred Thespians joined Leouidas at Ther­

mopylae; and they remained to perish with the 300

Spartans, when the other Greeks retired. (Herod.

vii. 202, 222.) Their city was burnt by Xerxes,

when iie overrau liocotia, and the inhabitants with­

drew to Peloponnesus (Herod, viii. 50.) The

survivors, to the number of 1800, fought at the

battle of l'lataea in the following year, but they

were reduced to such distress that they had no

heavy armour. (Herod, is. 30.) After the expul-

bion of the Persians from Greece, Thespiae was

rebuilt, and the inhabitants recruited their numbers

by the admission of strangers as citizens. (Herod.

viii. 75.) At the battle of Delium (b. c. 424)

the Thespians fought on the left wing against the

Athenians, and were almost all slain at their post.

(Time. iv. *J3, seq.) In the following year (u. c.

423;, the Thebans destroyed the walls of Thespiae,

on tlie charge of AtticUin, the Thespians being

unable to offer any resistance in consequence of the

liuavy loss they had sustained while lighting upon

lit.- side of the Thebans. (Thuc. iv. 133.) In b. c.
