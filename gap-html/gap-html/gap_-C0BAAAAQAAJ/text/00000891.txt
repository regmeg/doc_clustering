In the dearth of any more accurate information

we cannot fix the situation of these venerable relics

of Roman antiquity more precisely than may be

gathered from the preceding general indications.

M. Valerius Messala and C. Cassius Longinus, who

were censors in B.C. 154. projected, and even began,

a theatre at this spot, which was to extend from the

Lupercal on the Germalus towards the Palatine.

But this scheme was opposed by the rigid morality

of Scipio Nasica, and all the works were put up to

auction and sold. (Veil. Pat. i. 15; Val. Max. ii.

4. § 2; Appian, B. C. i. 28.) The Lupercal is men­

tioned in the Monttmentum Ancyranwn, as recon­

structed by Augustus; whence Canina infers that

the ancient one must have been destroyed when

this theatre was commenced. (/naHcazioiie Topogr.

p. 460, 1850.) The Casa Roinuli is represented by

Fabius Pictor, as translated by Dionysius of Hali-

carnassus (i. 79), to have been carefully preserved

in his time, the damage occasioned by age or tem­

pests being made good according to the ancient

pattern. Whether the building mentioned in the

Notitia was still the same it is impossible to say.

We have already noticed, when treating of the

city of Romulus, the Sanitcary of Victoria—

most probably a sacred grove—and the Cuvus

Victoriab on the NW. slope of the Palatine.

At or near this spot an Aedh-s Matkih Drum

was erected b. c. 191, to contain the image of the

Mater Idaea, which Scipio Nasica had brought

from Asia thirteen years before. (Liv. xxxvi. 35;

Cic. liar. R. 12.) It must have been to the N. of

the Casa Romuli, since it is mentioned after it in

the Notitia* when proceeding in that direction, yet

at some distance from the N. point of the hill, be­

tween which and the temple the Domus Tiberiana

must have intervened. It is recorded as having been

twice burnt down; once in n. c. 110, when it was

rebuilt by Metellus (Jul. Obs. 99), and again in

A. i>. 2, in the same fire which destroyed the palace

of Augustus, by whom it was restored. (Val. Max.

i. 8. § 11 ; Diun Cass. lv. 12; Man. Auqp-.). It

must also have been destroyed in the conflagration

under Nero, and again rebuilt. Becker (/landb.

p. 421) observes that its front must have laced the

K-, as the statue of the Magna Mater ldaea is

described by Dion Cassius as looking that way

(xlvi. 43). But this relates only to the statue;

and we fancy that there is some reason to believe,

from a passage in Martial, that the temple was a

round one, and could not therefore be properly said

to face any way. In this passage two temples are

mentioned (i. 70. 9):—

"Flecte vias hac qua mrwluli sunt tecta Lyaei

Et Cybeles picto stat Cory bante thoi us."

Becker observes (p. 422) that the age and situation

of the temples here mentioned cannot be determined,

as they occur nowhere else; and this seems to be true

of the temple of Bacchus; but there apj>ear« to bo no

reason why the Thou s Cykklks—which lWkcr

writes Torus, without any apparent meaning—may

not have been the Aedes Matris Deum before referred

to. The description of the road to the house of

Proculus given in this epigram suits the situation

of this temple; and the house itself is mentioned us

"nec propior quam Phoebus amat." Now, the temple

of Apollo, built by Augustus, lay close to that of the

ldacau Mother, as we shall see presently; and,
