tWWTCirs (Nssvlam: «»<> Tarto), a small river

Hats, Dewing into the sea between Lavinium

and Ardea. It is mentioned almost exclusively in

reference to the legendary history of Aeneas, who,

according to the poetical tradition, adopted also by

the Roman historians, was buried on its banks, where

he was worshipped under the name of Jupiter Indiges,

and had a sacred grove and Herourn. (Liv. i. 2;

Dionys. i. 64; Vict. (frig. Gent. Rom. 14: Ovid. Met.

xiv. 598—608; Tibull. ii. 5.39—44.) Immediately

adjoining the grove of Jupiter Indiges was one of

Anna Perenna, originally a Roman divinity, and

probably the tutelary nymph of the river, but who

was brought also into connection with Aeneas by

the legends of later times, which represented bet as

the sister of Dido, queen of Carthage. The fables

connected with her are related at full by Ovid {Fust.

iii. 545—564), and by Silius Italicua (viii. 28—

201). Both of these poets speak of the Nnmieius

as a small stream, with stagnant waters and reedy

banks: but they afford no clue to its situation, be­

yond the general intimation that it was in the

Laurentine territory, an appellation which is some-

times used, by the poets especially, with very vague

latitude. But Pliny, in enumerating the plates along

the coast of Latiuin, mentions the river Xumicius

between Laurentum and Ardea; and from the nar­

rative of Dionysius it would seem that he certainly

conceived the battle in which Aeneas was plain to

have been fought between Lavinium and Ardea, but

nearer the former city. Hence the Bio Torto, a

small river with a sluggish and winding stream,

which forms a considerable marsh near its outlet,

may fairly be regarded as the ancient Numicius. It

would seem from Pliny that the Lucus Jovis Imii-

getis was situated on its right bank. (Plin. iii. 5.

a. 9; Dionys. i. 64; Nibby, LHntorni, vol. ii. p.

418.) [E. H. B.]

NUMI'DIA, the central tract of country on the

N. coast of Africa, which forms the largest portion

of the country now occupied by the French, and

called Algeria or Algerit.

I. Name, Limits, and Inhabitants.

The continuous system of highlands, which extends

along the coast of the Mediterranean, was in the

earliest period occupied by a race of people con.-isting

of many tribes, of whom, the Berbers of the Algerine

territories, or the Kabyles or Quubuily, as they are

called by the inhabitants of the cities, arc the repre­

sentatives. These peoples,speaking a language which

was once spoken from the Fortunate Islands in the

W. to the Cataracts of the Nile, and which still ex­

plains many names in ancient African topography,

and embracing tribes of quite different characters,

whittB as well as blacks (though not negroes), were

called by the Romans Numidak, not a proper name,

but a common denomination from the Greek form

to^o!«s. (Strab. ii. p. 131, xvii. pp. 833. 837.)

Afterwards Numida and Numidia (No"^ii5!a and

ij Noua5ia or NojiaSiirr/, Ptol. iv. 3; Pomp. Mela, i.

6; Plin. v. 2, vi. 39) became the name of the nation

and the country. Sometimes they were called M.\r-

kusii Numidae (MoopooVioi Sofidbts, Appian, B.C.

ii. 44), while the later writers always speak of them

under the general name of Mauhi (Arom. Marc,

xxix. 5; Procop. B. V. ii. 4.) The most powerful

among these tribes were the Massvu (Motro-oAtor,

Polyb. iii. 44; Strab. ii. p. 131, xvii. p. 829; Dionys.

tories extended from the river Ampsaga to Tretum
