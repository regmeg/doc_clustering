proved useful against the Turks, are still existing.

MACKOPOGCCNES (Ma.tpawtbyun'f,'), or the

"Lonrbeards," one of the tribes of the W. Caucasus

(Strab. xi. p. 492). whose position must be fixed

somewhere near Tarabuzun. (Chcsnev, Euphrat.

vol. i. p. 276.) [K. B. J.]

MACTO'P.IUM (KaKriipiov). a town of Sicily, in

the neighbourhood of Gela, mentioned by Herodotus

(vii. 153). who tells us that it was occupied by a

body of Geloan citizens, wlio were driven out from

their country, and were restored to it by Telines,

the ancestor of Gelon. The name is also found in

Stephanus of Byzantium (*. r.), who cites it from

Philistus, but no mention of it occurs in later times.

The only clue to its position is that afforded by

Herodotus, who calls it "a city abort Gela," by

which he must mean further inland. Cluverius

conjectures that it may have occupied the Kile of

Rutera, a town on a hill about 8 miles inland from

Terranora, the site of Gela. (Cluver. SiciL p.

363.) [E.H.B.]

MACIjM, a town in the north of Aethiopia.

MACY'.VIA (Mcutwia, Strab. x. p. 451; Mcuciva,

Pint. Qiiaett. Graec. 15; Maxvvtia, Steph. B. t. v.:

Kth. MaKuvtit'), a town of Aetolia on the coast, at

the foot of the eastern slope of Mount Ta.phias.sus.

According to Strabo it was built after the return of

the Hcraclidac into Peloponnesus. It is called a

town of the Ozolian Iberians by the poet Archytns

of Amphis&a, who describes it in an hexameter line:

'* the grape-clad, perfume-breathing, lovely Slaeyna."

It is also mentioned in an epigram of Alcaeus, the

Messeui.in, who was a contemporary of Philip V.,

king of Macedonia. Pliny mentions a mountain Ma-

cynium, which must have been part of Mount Ta-

phiassus, nearMacynia, unless it is indeett a mistake

for the town. (Strab. x. pp. 451, 4G0; Plut. I. c.;

A nth. Grate, ix. 518; Plin. iv. 3; Leake, Northern

Greece, vol. i. p. 111.)

Madiiiu'S (Ma8oi/por, Ptol. iv. 3. § 30). a town in

MADEBA (Moi3oSaf, LXX.; Mfoa?n, Joseph.),

n city originally of Moab, and afterwards ob­

tained by conquest by Sihon, king of the Amor-

ites. (A'xmo. xxi. 30; comp. Joseph. Ant. xiii. 1.

§§ 2, 4.) The name does not occur in the I,XX.

in two of the passages in which it is found in the

Hebrew, in\ Mtudf Is ing substituted in Numbers

(/. e.) and rrjt MaoSi'tiJoj in Isaiah (xv. 2). It

fell to the lot of the Renbenites in the division of

the trans-Jordanio conquests, and was in their

southern border. (Joth. xiii. 9, 16.) It was one of

several Moabite cities occupied by the Jews under

Hyrcanos and Alexander Jannaeus (Joseph. Ant

xiii. 9. § I, 15. § 4), but was afterwards restored

by Hyrcanus II. to Aretas (xiv. 1. § 4). MnSaua

is placed by Ptolemy (v. 17. § 6) ill Arabia Petraea,

and joined with Heshbon. consistently with which

Eusebins and S. Jerome (Onomait. ». r.) noli-e it as

still existing, under its old name, in the vicinity of

Heshbon; where its ruins may still be identified.

"In order to see Medaba, I left the great mad it

Hcsban,—and proceeded in a more eastern dim-tiro.

... At the end of eight hours we reached MaiitUi

built upon a ronnd hill. This is the ancient Medaba,

but there is no river near it. It is at least half an

hour in circumference: I observed many remains rf

the walls of private houses, constructed with blocks

ofsilex; but not a single edifice is standing. There

is a large Birket" (" the immense tsnk" mentioned

by Irby and Mangles, p. 471, as " ihe only object of

interest"). *' On the west side of the town are tie

foundations of a temple, built with large stones, ard

apparently of great antiquity. ... A part of its

eastern wall remains. At the entrance of one of the

courts stand two columns of the Doric order:... in

the centre of one of the courts is a large well.*

(Burckhardt, Travel* in Syria, pp. 365,366.) It is

mentioned as t6\h MnSasW in the Council of

Chalcedon, and was an episcopal see of the Third

Palaestine, or of Arabia. (Reland, Paheatina,
