alSMIBGIl or SERRIUUM (Zitfnov, Dem. p.

Bwmury and town on the southern coast of

now Cape ilakri. It lay to the west of

raeia, aad opposite to the island of Saino-

soa, It is repeatedly mentioned by Demosthenes

L 95, 114, 133, R-), as having been Uken by

ua, courary to his engagements with the Athe­

SERRI, a people of the Asiatic Sarmatia, on the

Euxine. (Plin. vi. 5. s. 5.) Mela (i. 19) places them

between the Meianchlaeni and Siraceg. [T. H. D.]

SERRIUM. [Sf.bbiikum.]

SERVIODU'RUM, a town in the north-east of

Vindelicia on the Danube, on the road from Rcginum

to Boiodurum, near Augustana Cast ra. ( Tab. Petit.;

NoL Imp.) It must have occupied the site of the

modern Straubing, or some place in the neighbour­

hood, such as Azelburg, where ancient remains still

exist. [L. S.]

SKRVTTIUM, a town in the southern part of

Upper Pannonia, on the river Dravus, on the road

from Siscia to Sirmium. (/£. j4nt. p. 2C8; Geog.

liav. iv. 19, where it is called Serbetium; Tab.

Petit.) Its site has been identified with several

modern places; but the most probable conjecture is

that it occupied the place of the modern Sieverorczi,

the point at which the roads leading from Sirmium

and Siscia to Salona met. [L. S.]

SESA.MUS (iriaeuidt), a small river on the coast

of Paphlagonia, flowing into the Euxine near the

town of Amastris, whence in later times the river

itself was called Amastris. (Anonym. Peripl. I'. K.

SESECKl'EN'AE (SnnKpitMu vriaoi, Arrian,

site to the S. coast of India intra Gangein, and pro­

bably in the Sinus Colchicus — where Ptolemy

(vii. 1. § 10) places a town with the somewhat

similar name of Xvoiicovpai. It must have been in

the neighbourhood of Taprobane, since the Pcriplus

mentions the AiyiSluv yr/oot as close to the Sesc-

crienae, whiht Ptolemy (vii. 4. § 11) places the

same island amongst a number of others lying before

Taprobane, many of which must undoubtedly have

belonged to the Sesecrienae. [T. II. D.]

SESSITES (Setia), a river of Gallia Transpadana,

and one of the most imprrtant of the northern

tributaries of the Pad us. It flows beneath the walls of

Verccllae (leree/fi), and joius the Padus about 16

miles below that city. Its name is noticed only hy

Pliny (iii. 16. s. 20) and the Geographer of Ravenna

(iv.36), who writes the name Sisidus. [E. H. B.]

SESTIA'NAE ARAE (calle I by Ptolemy 2ao-Tiou

Baijaol ttxpov, ii. 5. § 3), the W. promontory of tho

N. coast of Gallaecia in Hispania Tarraconensis. It

had three altars dedicated to Augustus, whence its

name. (Plin. iv. 20. s. 34; Mela. iii. 1.) It is

the present Cabo YUlano (Florez, Esp. Stigr. xx.

p. 44; Sestini, Med. ltp. p. 103.) [T. H. I).]

SESTIA'RIA PROM. (Xn<TTiat>la (utpa. Piol. iv.

1. § 7), a headland on the N. coast of Mauritania

Tiitgitana, between capes Russadir and Abyla. It is

probably the same that is called Cannarum Promon-

torium in the /tin. Ant. (p. 11), lying at a distance,

of 50 miles from Russadir, or the present CtJio

Quilate*. [T. II. 1>.]

SESTI'NUM (Eth. Scstinaa: Settino). a town in

the interior of Uiubria, mentioned only by Pliny, who

enumerates the Seatinates among the towns of that

region (Plin. iii. 14.s. 19; Gruter, /n»cr. p. 108. 7),

but which still retains its ancient name. It is situ­

ated among the Apennines, at the source of the river

Foglia (Pisaurus). [E. 11. B.]
