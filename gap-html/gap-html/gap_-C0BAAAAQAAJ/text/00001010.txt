SARXA, a station on the road from Philippi to

Heracleia {Peut. Tab.), to the N. of the Lake Cer-

ciniles, between Strymon and Scotussa. Now Zikhna.

SASI'MA (Xdatfta), a town of Cappadocia, 24

Roman miles to the south of Naziansus; the place

contained the first church to which Gregory of Na-

suanzus was appointed, and he describes it as a most

miserable town. (It.Ant. p.144; IL Ilieros. p. 577;

Hierocl. p. 700, with Wesseling's note.) Some look

for its site near the modern Babloma, [L. S.]

SASO (2a<n£, Ptol. iii. 13. § 47; ^.axxusv. Strab.

vi. p. 281), a small, rocky island, lying off the coast

of Grecian IUyria, N. of the Acroceraunian promon­

tory, and possessing a landing-place which served as

a station for pirates. (Comp. Polyb. v. 110; Mela, H.

7; Plin. iii. 26. s. 30; Itin. Ant. p. 489.) It is

btill called Saseno, Sassono, or Sassa. [T. H. D.]

SASPI'RES, or SASITRI (2i>»eip€r, 2a-

Rhod. ii. 397, 1242; Steph. Ii. s. v.: cf. Atnm.

Marc. xxii. 8. § 21), a Scythian people, dwelling to

the S. of Colchis and N. of Media. According to

Herodotus and Stephanus (//. cc.) they were an in­

land people, but Apollonius places them on the sea-

coast. They belonged to the 18th satrapy of the

Persian kingdom (Herod, iii. 94), and were armed in

the same manner as the Coichians, that is, with

wooden helmets, small shields of untanned hide,

bliort lances, and swords (lb. vii. 79). The Pa­

risian scholiast on Apollonius derives their name

from the abundance of supplies found in their coun­

try. The Saspeires appear to have inhabited that

district of Georgia lying on the upper course of the

river Cyrus, in which Tijlis lies, which is still called

Tschin Kartuel; and as the district contains seve­

ral other places, the names of which begin with the

syllable Tschin, Ritter conjecture* that the Sa­

speires were identical with the eastern Iberians, re­

specting whom the Greeks invented so many fables.

(Rennell, Geogr. of Herod, p. 503; Ritter, Erdhmde,

ii. p. 922; Biiur, ad Herod, i. 104.) [T. H. I).]

SA'SSCLA, a town of Latium, situated in the

neighbourhood of Tibur, of which city it was a de­

pendency. It is mentioned only by Livy (vii. 19)

among the towns taken from the Tiburtines in B.C.

354, and was probably always a small place. The

site has been identified by Gell and Xibby with the

ruins of an ancient town, at the foot of the hill of

Sic Mono, between 7 and 8 miles from Tivoli

( Tibur). The ruins in question, consisting of a line

of walls of polygonal construction, surrounding a

hill of small extent, unquestionably indicate the

site of an ancient town; but as we know that the

Tiburtine territory contained several other towns

besides Empulum and Sassula, the only two whose

names are known to us, the identification of the

latter is wholly arbitrary. (Gell, Top. of Rome,

p. 394: Nibby, Dmtorni, vol. iii. p. 63.) [E.H.B.]

SATACH'ITIA (ZardxQa, or Sardxflcu, Ptol. iv.

7. § 17), a place in Aethiopia, on the left bank of

the Nile, probably near the present Korti, or else

somewhat more to the S., near the half-destroyed

village of Ambucote. [T. H. D.j

SA'TALA (SaTaAa), an important town of Ar­

menia Minor, as may be inferred from the numerous

routes which branched oil" from thence to Pont us

and Cappadocia. Its distance from Caesareia was

325 miles, and 124 or 135 from Trapezus. The

town was situated in a valley surron»l*i V* td^s-
