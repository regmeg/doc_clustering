theia, Bolina, Aiiryia. and Arba, (Pol. v. 2, 3. 28,

Sec: runs. vii. ]S. §6; Pol. xl. 3.) Of these places

we know only thp position of Bolina and Argyra.

Bolina was a little S. of the promontory Drepanum,

and pave its name to the river liolinaeus. (Pans. vii.

24. ^ 4.) Argyra was a little S. of the promontory

Bhitiin. (Pans. vii. 23. § I.) Patrae continued an

insignificant town clown to the time of Augustus,

although it is frequently mentioned as the place at

which persons landed going from Italy to Greece.

(Cut. ad Fam. vii. 2S. xvi. 1, 5, 6, ad Att. v. 9, vii.

2.) After the battle of Pharsalia (B.C. 48) Patrae

was taken posses.-.inn of by Cato, but shortly after­

wards surrendered to Calenus, Caesars lieutenant.

It was here also that Antony passed the winter

(32—31) when preparing for the war against Au­

gustus; and it was taken by Agrippn shortly before

the battle of Actium. (Dion Cass. xlii. 13. 14. I 9,

13.) It owed its restoration to Augustus, who re­

solved after the battle of Actium to establish two

Roman colonies on the western coast of Greece, and

for this purpose made choice of Nicopolis and Patrae.

Augustus colonised at Patrae a considerable body of

his soldiers, again collected its inhabitants from the

surrounding village-;, and added to them those of

It hypes. (Pans. vii. 18. § 7; 1 * J in. iv. 5.) He not

only gave Patrae dominion over the neighbouring

towns, such as Pharae (Pans. wi. 22. § 1), Pyme

(Pans. vii. 17. § 5), Tritaea (Pans. vii. 23. § 6), but

even over Locris. (Paus. x. 38. § 9.) On coins it

appears as a Roman colony with the name of Coionia

Aiujusta Aroi Patrentis. Strabo describes it in his

time as a populous place with a good anchorage,and

Pau.-anias has devoted four chapters to an account

of its public buildings. (Strab. viii. p. 387; Pans. vii.

18—21.) Of these the most important appear to

have been a temple of Artemis Laphria, on the acro­

polis, with an ancient statue of this goddess, removed

from Calydon to Patrae by order of Augustus, and

in whose honour an annual festival was celebrated;

the Odeum, which was the most magnificent build­

ing of the kind in Greece, after the Odeum of He-

rodes at Athens; the theatre; and on the seaside a

temple of Demeter, which was remarkable on account

of a well in front of it, which was supposed to fore­

tell the fate of sick persons; a mirror was suspended

on the water, and on this mirror there were certain

appearances indicating whether the person would

live or die. In the time of Paus&nias Patrae was

noted for its manufacture of byssus or flax, which

was grown in El is. and was woven at Patrae into head­

dresses (KCKp{xfta\oi) and garments. Women were

employed in this manufacture, and so large was their

number that the female population was double that of

the male; and as a natural consequence there was

great immorality in the town. (Pans. vii. 21. § 14.)

Patrae has continued down to the present day to

be one of the most important towns in the Aforea,

being admirably situated for communicating with

Italy and the Adriatic, and with eastern Greece by

means of the gulf of Corinth. It is frequently men­

tioned in the Byzantine writers. In a.k. 347 there

was an archbishop of Patrae at the council of Sar-

dica. In the sixth century it was destroyed by an

earthquake. (Piocop. G<>th. iv. 25.) It is subse­

quently mentioned as a dukedom of the Byzantine

empire; it was sold to the Venetians in I 108; was

taken by the Turks in 1446; was recovered by the

Venetians ic 1533; hut was shortly afterwards

taken aejain by the Turks, and remained in their

hands till the Greek revolution.

there are ruins of the Roman aqueduct of brick. 1
