of tliu growth of olives. (Ovid, Amor. ii. 16. 6, 7;

Martial, i. 27. 5, xiii. 121.) < »f the diameter of

the Peligni, we know only that they wore esteemed

as rivalling in bravery their neighbours the Marsi

(Plin. iii. 12. s. 17: Cic. in Vat in. 15; Sil. Ital.

viii. 510), and that from their secluded position

they always retained the primitive simplicity of

their habits. From an expression of Horace it

would appear also that they shared with the Marsi

the reputation of skill in magical ineaiit.tti.nis, (Hor,

Epod. 17. (10.)

The Peligni had only three principal towns, Coit-

FINIL'M, Si LMO, and SiTEKAKlJL'l M. of which the

two first only an; known historically, and were

doubtless much the most important places. Hut

Pliny notices all three in his list of towns; and the

same names are found also in the Liber Coloniarum.

(Plin. /.<•.; Lib. Vol*, pp. 228, 229.) Hence

these are obviously the three alluded to hy Ovid,

when he calls his native town of Sulmo *' Peligni

pars tertia ruris*' (Amor, ii. 16); and it thus ap­

pears there were no other places in the district

which enjoyed municipal rank and had a territory

of their own. Cuct'Li'M, mentioned only by Strabo

(v. p. 241) as situated to the right of the Via

Valeria, is evidently the modern Cnrullo. and must

have been in the territory of the Peligni, but was

probably an insignificant place. Statulae, known

only from the Tabula as a station on the Via Valeria,

7 miles from Corfinium, on the E. of the Mons

line us, must have been situated at or near the vil­

lage of Goriano.

The territory of the Peligni must always have

been an important point in regard to the communi­

cations of the different nations of Central Italy. On

the one side a natural pass, now known as the Forca

Caruso, called in the Tabula the Moss Lmei's,

connected the basin of the Gtzio and lower valley

of the Aternus with the land of the Marsi and basin

of the lake Fucinus; on the other the remarkable

pass or gorge through which the Aternus forces its

way just below Popoli, afforded a natural outlet,

through which these upland valleys had a direct

communication with the sea. These two passes, in

conjunction with that which led from the basin of

the Fucinus to Carseoli, formed a natural line of

way from Rome and the Tyrrhenian sea to the

Adriatic, which was undoubtedly frequented long

before the Romans subdued the Severn) nations

through which it (Missed, and ages before the Via

Valeria was laid down as an artificial road. That

highway, indeed, was not continued through the

land of the Peligni, and thence to the sea, until the

reign of the emperor Claudius [Cerfkmnia]. In

the other direction also the valley of the Ohio,

opening into that of the Aternus, afforded direct

means of communication with Reate, Interamna, and

the valley of the Tiber, while at its southern ex­

tremity a practicable pass led through the heart of

the Apennines into the valley of the Sagrus, and thus

opened a direct line of communication with the

interior of Samnium. The importance of this line

of mute, as well as the early period at w hich it was

frequented, is shown by the circumstance that it

wa> followed by the Roman armies in b. c. 340,

when the Samnites, as well as the Marsi and Peligni,

were friendly, and the revolt of the Latins cut off

their natural line of march into Campania. (Liv.

viii. 6.)

This line of road, as given in the Tabula, led

from Corfmium by Sulmo to Aufidena, and thence

! to Aesernia and Venafrum. At tbe aisto* ^7

and thus avoided the passage of the Pumodi»
