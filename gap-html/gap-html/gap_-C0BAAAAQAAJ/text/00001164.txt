governor of Syria appointed by Pompey, after having

punched its ruler, the Arabian prince Aretas, tor

tlie attacks which he had made upon the province

before it had been reduced to order, concluded a

treaty with him in is. c. G2. It is to this event

that the coins of Scaurus refer, bearing the inscrip­

tion EEX AHHTA9. (lickhei, vol. V. p. 131; cf.

Dion Cass, xxxvii. 15; Appian. Sgr. 51 j Joseph.

Ant xiv 4. §5,5. § 1.) Damascus was dependent

on the Bom ana, and sometimes had a Roman garrison

(Hieron. in Isai. c. 17; Joseph. Ant xiv. 11. § 7),

though it cannot be doubted that the Arabian kings

were in possession of it, on the condition of paying a

tribute. It has already been remarked that the city

was in the possession of an ethnarch of Aretas in

a.i>. 39: and it was not till the year 105, when

Arabia Petraea became a province, that Damascus

was united with Syria, in the proconsulship of Cor­

nelius Talma. (Eckhel, vol. iii. p. 330.)

On the other hand, Judaea appears to have been

annexed to the province of Syria immediately after

its conquest by Pompey in b.c. 63 (Dion Cass,

xxxvii. 15, 16; Eutrop. vi. 14; Liv. Kp. 102;Strab.

xvt. p. 762, sq.; Joseph. B* J. i. 7. § 7, Ainni.

Mara xiv. 8. § 12); though it retained its own ad­

ministration, with regard especially to the taxes which

it paid to the Romans. (Joseph. Ant, xiv. 4. § 4,

B. J. i. 7. § 6.) The race of the Jewish kings

ended with Aristobulos, whom Pompey, after the

captnre of Jerusalem, carried to Rome to adorn his

triumph (Appian, -Syr. 50; Dion Cass. xxxviL 16;

Pint. Pomp. 45; Joseph. Ant. xiv. 4, &c.) Hyr-

canua, the brother of Aristobulus, was left indeed in

Judaea as chief priest and ethnarch, in which offices

he was confirmed by Caesar; but his dignity was

only that of a priest and judge. (Dion Cass. I. cj

and Joseph. I. c. and xiv. 7. § 2, 10. § 2.) The land,

like the province of Syria, was divided for the con­

venience of administration into districts or circles of

an aristocratic constitution (Joseph. B.J. \. 8. § 5);

and during the constant state of war in which it w;ts

kept either by internal disorders, or by the incur­

sions of the Arabians and Parthians, the presence of

Roman troops, and of the governor of the province

himself, was almost always necessary.

It lias been already related [Jekusai-em, Vol. I.

I«. 26] that Antigen US, the son of Aristobulus, ob­

tained possession of the throne with the assistance

of the Parthiana in B. C. 40. In the following year

the Parthians were expelled from Syria by Ven-

t id ins (Dion Cass, xlviii. 39—41; Liv. Kpit.

127); and in xr. c. 38 Judaea was conquered by So-

sius, Antony's legatus, Antigonus was captured and

executed, and Herod, surnamed the Great, was

placed upon the throne, which had been promised to

In in two years previously. (Dion Cass. xlix. 19—

22; Pint. Anton. 34, sqq.j Tac, Hist. v. 9; Ap­

pian, B. C. v. 75; Slrab. xvi. p. 765.) From this

time, Judaea again became a kingdom. With re­

gard to the relation of Herod to the Romans we may

remark, that a Roman legion was stationed at Je-

rnsalem to uphold his sovereignty, that the oath of

t.-alty was taken to the emperor, as lord paramount,

as well as to the king, and that the absolute de-

pendence of the latter was recognised by the pay­

ment ot a tribute and the providing of subsidiary

troops. (Joseph. Ant. XT. 3. § 7, zvii. 2. § 4;

Appian, B. C. v. 75.) Herod, therefore, is to be

regarded only as a procurator of the emperor, with

the title of king. Antony assigned part of the re-

ve lues of Judaea to Cleopatra. (Joseph. Ant. xr.

4. §§ 2, 4.) According to an ordinance rf C«sr.

exception of Juppa, had to pay a yearly tribal* •

fourth of all agricultural produce, which

delivered the following year in Sid.ni, beside* i task

was intermitted. Besides this tribute, tbm»i

tax that the census mentioned in the i.
