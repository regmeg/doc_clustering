earlier emperors it was a " liberum oppidum " (Plin.

v. 3 ), afterwards under Hadrian a M colonia." (Ptol.

The old name is retained in the modern Ndbel, where

Barth ( Wanderungen, p. 141; comp. Shaw. Trav. p.

NEBIS. [Gaixaecia, Vol. I. p. 933, a.]

NEB0. 1. (Noga5, LXX.), the mountain from

which the patriarch Moses was permitted to view

the Promised Land. Its sitnntion is thus described:

— "Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto

Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that

is over against Jericho" (Deuf. xxxii. 49); "and

Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the

mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgab, that is over

against Jericho." We have here three names of the

mount, of which, however, Abarim may designate

the range or mountain region rising from the high

table-land of Moab (comp. Numbers, xxvii. 12,

xxxiii. 47); while Pisgah is an appellative for a hill,

—as it is rendered in our margin, wherever the

name occurs in the text (Numb. xxi. 20; I)euU

iii. 27, xxxiv. 1), and in several oriental versions

(Lex. s. t?. rUDD^—Nebo the proper name of some

one particular peak. This name is regarded by M.

Quatremere as of Aramaic origin, identical with that

of the celebrated Chaldean divinity (Isaiah, xlvi. 1)

so frequently compounded with the names of their

most eminent kings, &c; and he discovers other

names of like origin in the same parts. (Memoire

sur les Nabateengj p. 87.) It is placed by Eusebiua

and St. Jerome 6 miles west of Esbus (Heshbon),

over against Jericho, on the road from Livias to

Esbus, near to Mount Phogor [Peou]: it was

still called by its ancient name (Onomast. s. vv.

Nabau, Abarim). Dr. Robinson has truly remarked

that over against Jericho u there is no peak or point

perceptibly higher than the rest; but all is appa­

rently one level line of summit, without peaks or

f aps." ...41 Seetzen, Burckhardt, and also Irby and

Mangles, have all found Mount Nebo in Jebel'Attd-

rus, a high mountain south of the Zurka MainM

(Arnon). This, however, is far south of the lati­

tude of Jericho. (Bib. Res. vol. iii. pp. 306, 307).

2. A town of the tribe of Reuben, mentioned

with Heshbon, Elealeh, and others (Numb, xxxii.

38); doubtless the site now marked by Neba in the

JielLa, south of £s-Salt (Robinson, Bib. Res. vol.

ii. p. 307, n. 1, vol. iii. appendix, p. 170), \. e. in

the same district with Httban and £l~*Al, the

modern representatives of Heshbon and Elealeh.

Whether this town was connected with the synony­

mous mountain is very uncertain.

3. A town in Judah. (Ezra, ii. 29; Nchem. vii.

33.) [G. W.]

NEBRISSA. [Nabrissa.]

NEBRODES MONS (to NfuptiS^ 6pyj, Strab.:

Monti di Madonia), one of the most considerable

ranges of mountains in Sicily. The name was

evidently applied to a part of the range which com­

mences near Cape Pclorus, and extends along the

northern «ide of the island, the whole way to the

neighbourhood of Panormus. Though broken into

various mountain groups, there is no real interrup­

tion in the chain throughout this extent, and the

names applied to different parts of it neem to have

been employed (as usual in such case>) with much

vagueness. The part of the chain nearest to Cape

Pclorus, was called Mons Neptunius, and therefore

'the Mons Nebrodes must have been further to the
