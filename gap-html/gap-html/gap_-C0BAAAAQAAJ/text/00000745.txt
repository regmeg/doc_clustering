PORTUS VENERIS {Port Vendre), on the

south coast of France near the borders of Spain.

The passage about Portus Veneris in Mela (ii. 5)

is thus (ed. Is. Vossius): "T urn inter Pyrenaei

promuntoria Portus Veneris insignis fano." The

words "insignis fano" are a correction of Vossius

without any authority, which lie has substituted for

the words of the liest SIS., " in sinu salso." Port

Vendre is in France, near Coliioure, a few miles

south of the mouth of the 7>cA.

Ptolemy (ii. 10. § 2) fixes the boundary of Nar-

honensis at the promontory on which stood the

Aphrodisium or temple of Venus. Pliny (iii. 3)

in his description of Hi*pania Citerior, after men­

tioning Em]»riae (Ampurvu). says: "Klumen

Tichis. Ab co Pyrenaea Venus in latere promontorii

altero xL M." This river Tichis is the river which

is near the site of Emporiac (Ampuriai) in Spain.

D'Anville concludes that the promontorium of Pliny

is the Promontorium Pyrenaeum of the Table, the

modern Cop Creux, which projects into the Medi­

terranean. This would be a fit place for the temple,

for it was an ancient practice to build temples on

bold headlands. But Pliny says "on the other,"

that is on the Gallic side of the promontorium:

and the distance of zl. M. P. from the river of

Ampuria» brings us to the position of Port Vendre.

Accordingly D'Anville concludes that the temple of

Venus was near the port of Venus; and this would

seem likely enough. This temple is apparently

mentioned by Stephanus (*. v. *Atppo9totds); and

certainly by Strabo (iv. p. 178), who makes the coast

of the Narbonensis extend from the Var to tho

temple of the Pyrenaean Venus, the boundary between

Narbonensis and Iberia; but others, he adds, make

the Tropaea Pompeii the boundary of Iberia and

Celtica. The Tropaea Pompeii were in a pass of

the Pyrenees not far from the coast. In this

passage Strabo simply says that the temple of the

Pyrenaean Venus was fixed as the boundary of

Gallia and Hispania by some geographers, but this

passage does not tell us where the temple is; and

the distances which he gives in the same place

(iv. p. 178) will not settle the question. Hut in

another passage (iv. p. 181) lie makes the Galaticus

Sinus extend from a point 100 stadia from Massiliu

"to the Aphrodisium, the promontory of Pyrene."

It is plain that his promontory of Pyrene is Cap

Creux, for this is a marked natural limit of the

Gallic bay on the west; and he also places the

temple there. Cap Creux is a natural boundary

between Gallia and Hispania, and we may conclude

that it was the ancient coast boundary. Wo know

that Gen-aria, which is south of Portus Veneris and
