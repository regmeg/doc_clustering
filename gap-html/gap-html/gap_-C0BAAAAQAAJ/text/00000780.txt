696 REGILLUS LACtrS. RECHIUS.

unknown: but in the reign of Tiberius the Reatines

had to contend against a more formidable danger,

arising from the project which had been suggested

of Mocking up the outlet of the Lacus Velinus alto­

gether; a measure which, as they justly complained,

would undoubtedly have inundated the whole valley.

(Tac. Ann. i. 7'J.) Similar disputes and difficulties

again anise in the middle ages ; and in A. n. 1400

a new channel was opened for the waters of the Ve­

linus, which lias continued in use ever since.

Xo other mention occurs of Keate under the Ro­

man Empire; but inscriptions attest its continued

municipal importance : its name is found in the

Itineraries (Itin. Ant. p. 306), and it early became

the see of a bishop, which it has continued ever

since. Throughout the middle ages it was, as it

still continues to be, the capital of the surrounding

country. No ancient remains are now visible at

Rit ti. *

The territory of Reate was famous in ancient

times for its breed of mules and asses ; the latter

were particularly celebrated, and are said to have

been sometimes sold for a price as high as 300,000

or even 400,000 sesterces (Varr. R.R. ii. S. § 3;

Plin. viii. 43. s. 68), though it is difficult not to

suppose some error in these numbers. Hence, Q.

Axius, a friend of Varro, who had a villa on the

Lacus Velinus, ami extensive possessions in the

Reatine territory, is introduced by Varro in his dia­

logues f)e Re Ruxttca, as discoursing on the subject of

breeding horses, mules, and asses. (Varr. R. R. ii.

I. §8;Strab. v. p. 228.) It was at the villa of this

Q. Axius that Cicero lodged when he visited Reate.

(Cic. ad Att. iv. 15.) The Septem Aquae, men­

tioned by him in the same passage, and alluded to

also by Dionysius (i. 14), were evidently some

springs or source-, which supplied one of the small

lakes in the vallev of the Velinus. [E. H. B.]

RECHIUS. [Bolbe.]

REDINTUINUM ('PeStn-otiiiW). a town in the

northern part of the country occupied by the Mar-

comanni {Bohemia), is mentioned only by Ptolemy

(ii. 11. § 2<t). Sjine geographers regard it as

having occupied the site of the modern Prague, and

others identity it wit h I/orzitz; but nothing cer­

tain can be said about the matter. [L. S.]

RE'DONES ('PZ/Sores,'PrjlSorts), in the Celto-

galatia Lugdunensis of Ptolemy (ii. 8. § 12), are

placed by him west of the Senone.-; and along the

Li'*er. Their capital is Condate (Rennes). But

tlie Redones were not on the Loire Pliny (iv. 18)

enumerates the Rhedones among the peoples of

Gallia Lugdunensis: " Diablindi, Rhedones, Turones."

After the bloody tight on the Sambre (u. c. 57)

Caesar sent P. Crassus with a single legion into

the- country of the Veneti, Redones, and other Celtic

tribes between the Seine and the Loire, all of whom

submitted. (/?. G. ii. 34.) Caesar here enumerates

the Redones among the maritime states whose ter­

ritory extends to the ocean. In b. c. 52 the Re­

dones with their neighbours sent a contingent to

attack Caesar during the siege of Alesia. In this

passage also (Ii. G. vih 75), the Redones are enu­

merated among the states bordering on the ocean,

which in the Celtic language were called the

Armoric States. D'Anviile supposes that their ter­

ritory extended beyond the limits of tho diocese of

Rennet into the dioceses of St. Malo and J>ol. Their

chief town, Raines, is the capital of the department

of Iih-et-Yifaine. [G. I..]
