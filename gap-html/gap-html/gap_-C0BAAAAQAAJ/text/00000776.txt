RAMBA'CIA ('Po^iwfo, Arrian, Anab. vi. 21),

a village of the Orilae, the first which was taken by

Alexander the Great in his march westwards from

the Indus. There can be no certainty as to its

exact position, but the conjecture of Vincent seems

well grounded that it is either the Ram-nagar or

Ibe Finm-rjur of the Ayin Akbart. (Vincent, Voyagt

of Ncarthut, vol i. p. 185.) [^ 0

RAMK, a place in Gallia NarhoneiMtt, which the

Siscia (Jt* /Heron.p. 561; Geogr. Itav.iv.19; Tub.

J\'ttt.) Its site has not yet been ascertained with

certainty. [I„ S.]

RAMOTH, identical in signification with Ram

and Ifamah, equivalent in Hebrew to " an emi­

nence," and hence a generic name for towns situ­

ated on remarkable heights, as so many in Palestine

were. Besides those above named [RaKAH; Ra-

matha] was a Ramah in the tribe of Asher, not

far from Tyre; and another in Naphthali (Josh.

six. 29, 30) in the north, and a Ramath in the

tribe of Simeon, appropriately called "Ramath of

the South " (ver. 8.), to which David sent a share

of the spoils of Ziklag (1 -Sam. xxx. 27). and yet a

Ramoth in Issachar, assigned to the LeVites of the

family of Gershom. (1 Chron. vi. 74.) More im­

portant than the foregoing was——

RAMOTH-G1LEAD fPop&0 cV TaXadS), a

city of the tribe of Gad, assigned as a city of refuge,

first by Moses and subsequently by Joshua. (JJeiit.

IT. 43; Josh. xx. 8, 'AprjfiwB.) It was also a Lc-

vitical city of the family of Merari. {Josh, xxi 38.)

The Syrians took it from Aliab. who lost his life in

seeking to recover it. (1 Kings, xxii.) Eiisebius

places it 15 miles west of Philadelphia {Onomast.

RAPHIA ('Parpia, 'Pa^fm). a maritime city in

the extreme south of Palestine, between Gaza and

Rhinocorura, a day's march from both, reckoned by

Josephus, Polyoma, and others, as the tirst city of

Syria. (Joseph. B.J. iv. 11. § £; Polyb. v. 80.)

It was taken from the Egyptians by Alexander

Jannaeus, and held by the Jews for some time. It

was one of the ruined and doj»npulatc<i cities restored

by Gabtnius. {Ant. xiii. 13. § 3, 15. § 4, xiv. 5.

§ 3.) It is mentioned also by Strabo (xvi. p, 759)

and in the Itinerary (if Antoninus, between the above-

named towns. Coins of Raphia still exist, and it was

represented by its bishop in the council of Ephesus,

and iu those of Constantinople, a. r>. 536 and 553.

(Reland, s. p. pp. 967, UGH; Le Quien, Orient Chris-

tiamts, vol. iii. pp. 6*29, 630.) It was in the neigh­

bourhood of this city that a great battle was fought

| between Ptolemy Philopator and Ant'wcbus it

Great, in which the Utter was rooted with usasa

loss. (3 Maccab. i. 2; Polyb. t. 60. 4c.; Banal

ail Dan. cap. xi.) Its site is still mtrked by m

name Refah, and two ancient rranite colons* i

situ, with several prostrate frarments, the raaal
