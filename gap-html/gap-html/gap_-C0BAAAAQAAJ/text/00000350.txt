AIESANI'TES SINUS (M«<raWTwj, al. Maura-

vIttjs faJAiroj), a bay at the extreme north of the

Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf. (Ptol. v. 19.

§ L vi. 7. § 19.) Forster finds the modern repre­

sentative of the ancient name in the Phrat J/wan

({ D'Anviile, at the mouth of the Euphrates, or the

Shat-al-Arab. {Arabia, vol, ii. p. 55.) "The

coincidence of names," ho says, '* is important, as

placing it in our power to point out two towns

which Ptolemy disposes close to this hay; viz.

Iilicara (TSocctoa) in El-Kader, a town at the

mouth of the old bed of the Euphrates, and Jucara

('lowtdpa), in Dsjdhhrt, an ancient town, now in

ruins, 20 miles south of El-Kadtr, now Core

Boobian" (p. 214). [G. W.]

AIESA'MBRIA (MiffauSptrj, Arrian, Jnd. c. 38).

a small place, apparently a chereonesus on the

AIESA'MBRIA. [AIkskmutua.]

chain of the Mahee or Kong Mountains, to the N. of

Dahomey. [E. B. J.]

MESE'MBRIA (Mfffijuffpio, Dor. Vl«trau6pta:

Eth. M*<rr}u€ptav6s). 1. An important Greek city

in Thrace, situated on the coast of the Euxine

and at the foot of Alt. Haetnus (Scymn. Ch. 738);

consequently upon the confines of Aloesia, in which

it is placed by Ptolemy (iii. 10. § 8). Strabo (vii.

p. 319) relates that it was a colony of the Ale-

garians, and that it was originally called Alenebria

(Mfff^(a) after its founder Alenas; Stephanus B.

(*. r.) says that its original name was Alelsembna

(MrA'iijuS^i'a), from its founder Alelsas; and both

writers state that the termination -bria was the

Thracian word for town. According to the Ano­

nymous Peri pi us of the Euxine (p. 14) Afesembria

was founded by Chalcedonians at the time of the

expedition of Darius against Scythia; but according

to Herodotus (vi. 33) it was founded a little later,

after the suppression of the Ionic revolt, by Byzantine

and Chalcedonian fugitives. These statements may,

however, be reconciled by supposing that the Thra­

cian town was originally colonized by Alegarians, and

afterwards received additional colonists from By­

zantium and Chaleedon. Alesembria was one of the

cities, forming the Greek Pent a polls on the Enxine,

the other four being Odessa*, Totni, Istriani and Apol-

lonialae. (See BoVkh, Jnscr. vol. ii. p. 996.) Me-

aemhria is rarely mentioned in history, but it con­

tinued to exist till a late period. (Mela, ii. 2;

Plin. iv. 11. i. 18; Ptot. I c.; Tab. Pent)

2. A Greek city of Thrace, on the Aegaean Sea,

and not far from the mouth of the Lissua. (H «L

▼ii. 108; Steph. B. a. v.)

MESE'XE (M«rw)|, Strab. ii. p. 84), a aaaafl

tract of land in ancient Mesopotamia, ah ml Lv

exact position of which there has been much <L-»-

cussion, owing to the indistinct and o infused »:-

counts of it which have been preserved in anrsrtt

authors. The real cause of this would aeern tJ V-

that there were two districts at no great disMor*

one from the other, both of which, fnwn auizkc

reasons, bore the name of Alesene, or Middle-Laa*

One of these was near the mouths of the Tiprm.

where that river is divided into two brmncboa, e»-

responding to tlie modern tract called Shot'-sU-Arab

(Steph. B. *. e. Mwiirq.) To this Aleseue- marf

be referred the passage in Philostorgios (//. £.

iii. 7), in which he states that the Tigris, hef/re c

reaches the sea, is divided into two great bran* b^

forming an extensive island, which is inhabited by

the Aleseni. To this also belongs the Alesene, men­

tioned in the history of Trajan by Dion L'mju,

who calls it an island in the Tigris, over wUh

Athambilus was the ruler (lxriii. 28). The iti>r

was much higher up on the same river, and has

derived its chief importance from its capital Apaiijria.

Stephanus speaks of this tract in two places ; fers*

(s. v. 'Awdfitia), where he states that thai city is

surrounded by the Tigris, where that liver m di­

vided into two streams, of which that on the rifL;

hand is called I Mas, and that on the left bear* the

name of Tigris; and secondly (*. r. 'OpaBa), wbm

he asserts that Oratha is a town of Alesene. which

is near the Tigris, according to Arrian, in the 16u

book of his Parthica.

Pliny evidently refers to this Alesene, when be m

speaking of Apameia, which town he state* to haw

been 125 miles on this side (i.e. to the X.) «■*

Seleuccia; the Tigris being divided into two chan­

nels, by one of which it Hows to the & and to

Seleuceia, washing all along Alesene (vi. 27. ». 31 X

There might have been some doubt to which Mneoe

Ammianus refers; but as he mentkcie T*-r*d««,

which was near the mouth of the Tigris, it t* pruhaf-Jr

that he is speaking of the former one (x-XiT. 3}.

The district in the neighbourhood of the Apan>*iMi

Alesene has been surveyed with great care by Ljrut-

Lynch; and, from his observations, it seems alirvjri

certain that the more northern Alesene was the

territory now comprehended between ti/« I*jrU

and the Tigris. (Jtoy. tltogr. Joum. vol. ix. ft
