1296 VIA CASSIA. VIA AURELIA.

The stations from Rome, as far as Luna in Ktrnria,

aiv thus given in theAntonine Itinerary (p.290, &c):

Lorium (near L'astel (initio) - xii. M.P.

AJ '1'urres (Sfonteroni)) - - x.

Pyrgi Senra) - - xii.

Castrum Novum ('/' di Chiaruccia) viii.

Papuiana ( Viareggio f) - - xi.

Luna (Luni) - - xxiv.

Tin- stations thence along the coast of Ligu-

ria as far as the river Varus have been mentioned

in the article Lrjtkia: and the distances along this

part of the line, in both the Antonine Itinerary ami

the Tabula, are so confuted and corrupt that it is

useless to attempt their correction. Even uf that

part of the Via Auivlia above given, along the coast of

Ktrnria. several of the stations are very uncertain.and

some of the distances are probably corrupt. From

Home to Centum Cellae, indeed, the road has been

carefully examined and tin- distances verihYd (West-

pli.il, Hum. Kamp, pp. 162 — 10'J): but this has not

been done farther on: and as the road traversed

tin- Mart mmo. which was certainly in the latter ai:es

of the Roman Empire, us at the present day, a thinly-

peopled and unhealthy district, several of the stations

were probably even then obscure and unini[>ortant

places. The Tabula, as usual, gives a greater number

(if such stations, several of which may be identified as

the j*>int* where the road crossed rivers and streams

whose names are known. Hut the route is given

very confusedly, ami the distances are often incor­

rect, while in some eases they arc omitted altogether.

the Via Aemiiia liad probably already been praoor*

(Strab. v. p. 217.) The other. vrh:ch wasia^*

the Via Postumia, and was therefore pruOE^y ob­

structed at a different period, led from Dertora iff**

the mountains direct to Genoa. Btch tb^r lit-*
