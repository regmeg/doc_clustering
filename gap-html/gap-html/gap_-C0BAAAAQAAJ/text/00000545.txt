emperors. (Socrat. ii. 28.) At a later period it

abounded with monasteries and churches. The

Greater and the Lesser Oasis were reckoned as

forming together a single Home, but by ihe Ro­

man emperors were annexed to the prefecture of

the Thebaid. (Plin. v. 9. s. 9, duo Oasitae; Ptol. iv.

to be the modern Av'tla. (Hieron. de Kir. IU. c. 121,

and Florez, Esp. S. xiv, 3, ap. Ukert, vol. ii. pL 1.

O'BOCA (:OedKo, Ptol. ii. 2. §8), a river on the

W. coast of Ireland, now the Boyne. [T. H. D.]

OBRIMAS, a river of Phrygia, an eastern tribu­

tary of the Maeander, had its sources, according to

Livy (xxxviii. 15), on the eastern side of Mount

Cadmus, near the town of Ahporidos, and flowed in

the neighbourhood of Apamea Cibotus (Plin. t. 29.)

This is all the direct information we possess about

it; but from Livy's account of the expedition of

Manlius, who had pitched his camp there, when he

was visited by Seleucus from Apamea, we may gather

some further particulars, which enable us to identify

the Obriinas with the Sandukli Chai, Manlius had

marched direct from Sagalassus, and must have led

bis army through the plains of Dombai, \ assing iu

the rear of Apamea. Thus Seleucus would easily

hear of the consul being in his neighbourhood, and,

in his desire to propitiate him, would have started

after him and overtaken him the next day (postero

die.) Manlius, moreover, at the sources of the

Obrimas required guides, because he found himself

hemmed in by mountains and unable to find his way

to the plain of Metropolis. All this agrees perfectly

well with the supposition that the ancient Obriinas

is the modern Sandukli Chai (Hamilton. Researches,

ii. p. 172, &c.). Franz (Funf Inschriften, p. 37),

on the other hand, supposes the Kodsha Chai to

correspond with the Obrimas. Arundel) {Itiscov. in

Asia Atin. i. p. 231), again, believes that Livy has

confounded the sources of the Marsyas and Maeander

with those of the Obriinas. [L. S.J

OBRINGA ('Ofy.7j.af). Ptolemy (ii. 10. § 17)

makes the Obringas river the boundary between

Lower and Upper Gcrmania. The most southern

place in Lower Germania according to his map is

Mogunliacum (Mojcqj/tiokoV), Mainz. He places

in the following order the cities of Upper Germania,

which are south of the Obringas: — Noeomagus

(Speier), Borbetomagus {Worms), Argentoratum

(Strassburg), and so on. But Worms is north of

Speier; and the relative position of these two placet!

is thevefure wrong iu Ptolemy. He has also placed
