972 SETUIA.

SETUIA (SeTouia), a town of the Quadi, in the

south-east of Germany, apparently near the sources

of the river Aucha, a tributary of the Danube, in

the Carpathian mountains. (I'tol. ii. 11. § 29.)

Its identification is only matter of conjecture. [L.S.]

SEVACES (Scoraccr), a tribe in the western

part of Noricnm, is mentioned only bv Ptolemy (ii.

14. §2.) [L.S.]

SEVE'RI MURUS. [Vallum.]

SEVE'KUS MONS, a mountain of Central Italy

mentioned only by Virgil (Aen. vii. 713), who

places it among the Sabines, and associates it with

the Mom Tetriea. It therefore evidently belonged

to the lofty central ranges of the Apennines, in

that part of Italy, hut cannot be identified with

more accuracy. [Apknninus.] [E. H. It.]

SEUMARAor SEUSAM0RA(2^apaand Sew

irdfiopa, Strab. xi. p. 501), a town in the Caucasian

Iberia. [T. H. D.]

SEVO, a lofty mountain in the extreme north of

ancient Germany, in the island of Scandia, in the

territory of the Ingaevones. It was believed to equal

in extent and magnitude the llipaei Montes. (Plin.

iv. 27; S>lin. 20.) There can be no doubt that this

mountain is the same as Mount Kjole/i which at

present separates Sweden from Aor/cav, and the

southern branch of which still bears the name of.Sprc-

Ryggen. [Scandia.] [L. S.]

SEURBI. [Skbvrri.]

S EX. [ SA X F.TAN I'M.]

5EXANTAPR1STA ('E^OKrcEirptoTa, IVocop. de

Atd. iv. 11. p. 307), a town of Moesia Inferior, on

the Danube, on the great high-road between Tri-

mammium and Tigra. (/tin. Ant. p. 322.) Ac­

cording to the Nolit. Imp- (where it is called

Sexagintaprista), the 5th cohortof the 1st Legio Ital.,

together with a squadron of cavalry, lay in garrison

here. Some identify it with RusUckuk, whilst others

place it further to the E., near Lipnik. [T.H.D.]

SEXTANT10, in Gallia Narbonensis. The true

name of this place is preserved in an inscription

found at Nemausus (JViflte*), and published by

Menard. The name is written Sextatio in the An-

tonine I tin ; and Sostantio in the Jerusalem Itin.

The remains of Sextantio are supposed to be those

which are about 3 miles north of Montpdltrr, on

the banks of the Ledos (Lez). [Ci. L.]

SHAALABBIN (^AajuiV, LXX), a city of the

tribe of Dan (Josh. xix. 42) joined with Ajalon

("IaaAu'i/), and mentioned in the LXX. (not in the

Hebrew) as one of the cities in which the Amorites

continued to dwell, after the occupation of Canaan

by the Israelites (xix. 48). This last fact identities

it with the Shaalbiin (LXX. fc>a\a§tV) of the book

of Judges (i. 35), which is also joined with Aijalon,

and of which the same fact is related. It is there

placed in Mount Heres. Eusebius mentions a

village named Salaba (2aAa£ct), in the borders of

fSebaste (Onomast. t. v.), which could not be in

Dan: but S. Jerome (Comment, in Ezcch. x'.viii.)

mentions three towns in the tribe of Dan, Ailon,

Selebj and Einaus. It is joined with Makaz and

Beth-shemesh in 1 King* iv. 9, which also indicates

a situation in or near the plain of Sharon. In Mr.

Smith's list of places in the district of Rnmh'h, is a

village named Selbtt, containing all the radicals of

the Scripture name, and probably identical with

Selebi of Joseph US, as the modern Yaio is with

Ajalon and 'Arnicas with Emmaus. Its place is

not definitely fixed. (Robinson, hibl Re*, vol. iii.

2nd appendix, p. 120.) [G. W.]
