the Propontis, of which we may mention Aegospo-

tami, renowned, notwithstanding its insignificant size,

the Arms, and the Erginus. The rivers which fall

into the Euxine are all small, anil few of them are

distinguished by name in tlie geographers, though

doubtless not so unhononred by the dwellers upon

their banks : among them Pliny (iv. 18) mentions

the Pira and the Orosrines. The Hebrus drains at

least one-half", probably nearer two-thirds, of the en­

tire surface of Thrace ; and on its banks, or on those

of its tributaries, most of the level portions of the

country are situated, as well as nearly all the inland

towns. Its principal affluents are the Arda (in some

maps called the Harpessus), and the Suemus on the

\V\, the Tonzus, Artiscus, and Agrianes on the E.

The Thracian coast of the Aegean is extremely

irregular in its outline, being broken up by bays

which enter far into the land, yet appear to be of

comparatively little depth. Most of them, indeed,

are at the mouths of rivers, and have probably

been filled up by alluvial deposits. It was perhaps

for this reason that several of them were called

lairs, as it* they had been regarded as belonging to

the land rather than to the sea; e. g. Lake Cercinitis,

already mentioned, winch seems, indeed, to have been

little more than a marsh, and in Kiepert's map its

site is so represented; Lake Bistonis,east of Abdera;

and Stentoris Lac us, at the mouth of the Hebrus.

The gulf of Melas, formed by the northern shore of

the Chersonesus and the opposite coast of what may

he called the mainland, is an exception to this de­

scription of the Thracian bays. The coasts on the

Propontis and the Euxine are comparatively un­

broken, the only gulf of any extent being l'ortus

llellodos, near Anchialus, which is known in mo­

dern times, by the name of the bay of Bourghaa,

as one of the best harbours in the Euxine, the Thra­

cian shore of which was regarded by the ancients as

extremely dangerous. [Salmypkssus,]

The principal promontories were, Ismarnm, Ser-

rheum, Sarpedonium, and Mastusium, on the southern

coast; Thyoias and Haemi Extrema, on the eastern.

For an account of one of the most remarkable parts

of Thraee, see Ciikksonesus, Vol. I. p. 608.

Off the southern coast are situated the islands of

Thasos, Samotbrace, and Imbros; the first is sepa­

rated from the mainland by a channel about 5 miles

wide; the other two are considerably more distant

from the shore.

The climate of Thrace is always spoken of by the

ancients as being extremely cold and rigorous; thus

Athenaeus (viii. p. 351) describes the year atAenos

as consisting of eight months of cold and four months

of winter; but such statements are not to be taken

literally, since many of them are mere poetical

exaggerations, and are applied to Thrace as the

representative of the north in general. The Haemus

was regarded as the abode of the north wind, and the

countries beyond it were believed to enjoy a beauti­

fully mild climate. (See Niebuhr, Ethnog. and

(Jwg. i. p. 16, Eng. trans.; Soph. Antig.985; Eurip.

Jines. 440; Tbeophr. de Caus. v. 17; Virg. Georg. iii.

350 seq.; Ov. Pont. iv. 10. 41, ib. 7. 8; TrisL iii.

10; &c.). Even after making full allowance for the

undoubted effect of vast forests, undrained marshes,

and very partial cultivation, in lowering the average

temperature of a country, it is difficult to believe

that a land, the northern boundary of which (i. e. of

Thrace Proper) is in the same parallel of latitude as

Tuscany und the Pyrenees, and the highest moun­

tains of which are less than 9000 feet above the

level of the sea, can have had s Terr sro
