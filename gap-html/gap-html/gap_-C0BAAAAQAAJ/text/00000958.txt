direct to Reatc, and thence ascended the valley of

the Vclinus by lnterocrea and Falacrinum, from

whence it crossed the ridge of the Apennines into

the valley of the Truentus in Picenum, and thus

descended to Asculum and the Adriatic. The

stations between Home and Keate were Ereturn,

which may be fixed at Grotta Marozza, and Vicus

Novus, the site of wliich is marked by the Osterui

Nuova, or Otteria dei Massacci, 32 miles from

Rome. (Westphal, Rom. Kamp, p. 128.) [Via

Salaria.]

Notwithstanding its mountainous character the

Sabine territory was far from being poor. Its pro­

ductions consisted chiefly of oil and wine, wliich,

though not of hrst-rate quality, were abundant, and

supplied a great part of the quantity used by the

lower classes at Iloine. (Hor. Carm. i. 9. 7, 20. 1;

Juv. iii. 85.) The Sabine hills produced also in

abundance the plant wliich was thence known as

Sabina herba (still called Sarin), wliich was used

by the natives for incense, before the more costly

frankincense was introduced from the East. (I'lin.

xvi,2(J s. .33. xxiv. 11. s.61; Virg. 1'iU. 402; Ovid,

Fast. i. 342.) The ueigtiliourhtHxi of* Reate was

also famous for its breed of mules and horses; and

the mountains afforded excellent pasturage for

sheep. The wilder and more inaccessible summits

of the Apennines were said still to be frequented by

wild goats, an animal long since extinct throughout

the continent of Italy. (Varr. R. R. ii. 1. §5,

3. §3.) [K. H. IVJ

SAIilS (2a£is). a small river of Carmaiiia, which

is mentioned by Mela in connection with two other

small streams, the Andanis ami Coros (iii. 8).

It is also noticed by Pliny, who places it in the

neighbourhood of Harmuza (Ormnz, vi. 23. s. 27).

Ptolemy speaks of a town in Carmaiiia of the same

name with this river (vi. 8. § 14). [V.]

SABIS (Sitii/brt ), a river of llelgica, which joins

the Mosa (J/rtflit) at Charleroi. Caesar (it. c. 57)

marched against the Nervii and their confederates

from the .south, and lie found the enemy posted on

the north side of the Sabis (/{. G. ii. 16). In this

battle the Bel<rae were defeated with great slaughter.
