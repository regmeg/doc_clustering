rivers. (Strab. L c, and iv. p 182.) Only three

roads over them were known to the Romans; the

most westerly, by Carasae (now Garii), not far

from the coast of the Cantabrian sea, and which

doubtless was the stiH practicable route over the

Bidasoa by Fuenlerabia; the most easterly,

which was also the most frequented, and is still

used, near the coast of the Mediterranean by

Juncaria (now Junqwra); and one which lay

between these two, leading from Caesaraugusta to

Beneamum (now Barege). (fttn. Ant. pp. 390,

452, 455; Strab. iii. p. 160; Liv. xxi. 23, &c.)

Respecting the present condition of the Pyrenees, the

reader may consult Miuano, lHccionario, vii. p. 38,

seq.; H uber, Skizzen aus Spanien, Gbtt. 1833; and

Ford, Handbook of Spain, p. 579, seq. From the

last authority, it will be perceived, that the cha­

racter of the Gallic and Spanish sides has been

somewhat reversed since tho days of Strabo; and

that, while "the French slope is full of summer

watering-places and sensual, the Spanish side is

rude, savage, and Iberian, the lair of the smusigler

and wild bird and beast." [T. H. D.]

PYRGI (nipyoi: Eth. Pyrgensis: Santo Se-

vera), a city on the coast of Etruria, situated

between Alsium and Castrum Novum, and distant

34 miles from Rome .{Kin. A nU p. 290.) It was

rather more than 6 miles (50 stadia) from Caere, of

which it served as the port (Strab. v. p. 226). but

it is probable that it was not originally designed for

that purpose, but grow up in the first instance

around the temple of Eileithyia, for which it con­

tinued to be celebrated at a much later period.

(Strab. I c; Diod. xv. 14.) The foundation of

this temple is expressly ascribed to the Pelasgians,

and the pure Greek form of the name certainly

tends to corroborate this statement. It is probable

that both Pyrgi and the neighbouring Caere were

originally Pelasgian settlements, and that this was

the cause of the close connection between the two,

which led to Pyrgi ultimately passing into the con­

dition of a dependency on the more powerful city

of the interior. Virgil calls it an ancient city

(Pyrgi veteres, Aen. x. 184), and represents it as

one of the Tuscan cities that sent assistance to

Aeneas. But the only mention of Pyrgi in history

during the period of Etruscan independence is in

b. c. 384, when the treasures of its temple attracted

the cupidity of Dionysius of Syracuse, who made a

piratical descent upon the coast of Etruria, and,

landing his troops at Pyrgi in the night, surprised

and plundered the temple, from which he is said to

have carried off spoils to the value of 1000 talents.

(Diod. xv. 14; Strab. v. p. 226; Arist. Oecon. ii.

21; Polyaen. v. 2. 21.) The amount of the booty

seems incredible, but the temple was certainly very

wealthy: and it would seem that the people of

Pyrgi had given some excuse for the aggression, by

themselves taking an active part in the piracies

carried on at this period by the Etruscans in general.

Servius, indeed, represents it as bearing the chief

part in those depredations; but this may probably

be an exaggeration. (Serr. ad Aen. x. 184.) It
