(Plin. xxxv. 3. s. 15); ami tlte city long remained

the home of painting (i4 diu ilia fuit patria picturae,"

Plin. xxxv. 11. s. 40). Sicyon pave its name to

one of the great schools of painting, which was

founded by Eupompus, and which produced Pam-

philns and Apelles. (IMin. xxxv. 10. s. 36.) Sicyon

was likewise the earliest school of statuary in

Greece, which was introduced into the city by

Dipoenus and ScylHs from Crete about B.C. 560

(PHn* xxxvi. 4); but its earliest native statuary of

celebrity was Canaehus. Lyaippus was also ft native

of Sicyon. {Diet, of Bi*iyt: s. vv.) The city was

thus rich in works of art; but its most valuable

paintings, which the Sieyom'ans had been obliged to

give in pledge on account of their debts, were

removed to Kome in the aedileship of 51. Scaurus, to

adorn his theatre. (Plin. xxxv. 11. s. 40.)

Sicyon was likewise celebrated for the taste and

skill displayed in the various articles of dress made

by its inhabitants, among which we find mention of

a particular kind of shoe, which was much prized

in all parts of Greece. (Athen. to, p. 155; Pollux,

were more finely situated than Sicyon. The hill

on which it stood commands a most splendid view.

Towards the west is seen the plain to celebrated

for its fertility; towards the east the prospect is

bounded by the lofty hill <>f the Aci<korinthus; while

in front lies the sea, with the noble mountains of

Parnassus, Helicon, and Cithaeion rising from the

opjx)site coast, the whole forming a charming

prospect, which cannot have been without influence

in cultivating the love for the fine arts, for which

the city was distinguished. The hill of Sicyon

is a tubular summit of a triangular shape, and is

divided into an upper and a lower level by a low

rid^e of rocks stretching right across it, and form­

ing an abrupt separation between the two levels.

The upper level, which occupies the southern point

of the triangle, and is about a third of the whole,

was the Acropolis in the time of Pausanias (7/ vxiv
