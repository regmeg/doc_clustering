possible, hut not the latter, for Strabo places Olbc in

the interior of Cilicia, between the rivers Lamus and

Cydnus, that is, in the mountainous districts of the

Taurus. According to tradition, Olbe had been

built by Ajax, the son of Teucer; it contained a

temple of Zeus, whose priest once ruled over all

Cilicia Aspera. (Strab. I. c.) In later times it was

regarded as belonging to Isauria, and was the seat of

a bishop. (Hieroel. p. 709; Basil. Vil. Theclae, ii.

8.) We still possess coins of two of those priestly

princes, Polemon and Ajax. (Eckhel, Doctr. Num.

Stephanus Bvz. (*. v. 'OASi'a) culls Olbasa or Olbe

says that it was anciently called Olbiopolis, and

occur elsewhere, and is derived probably from the

ethnic name Olbiopolitae ('OA<>ioiroA»Tai, Herod,

iv. 18; Snid. s. v. noo-etSttVios), which appears on

coins as late as the date of Caracalla and Alexander

Sevems. (Koliler, Mem. de I'Acud. tie St Petertb.

tique* dOlbiopolis ou dOlbia, Paris, 1822; Mion-

net, Descr. det Mid. vol. i. p. 349.) Although the

inhabitants always called their city Olbia, strangers

were in the habit of calling it by the name of the

chief river of Scythia, Borysthenes (BopueroVvn?,

Bopoo-fltm), and the people Borystiienitae (Bo-

pva&cvttTai, Herod. I. c; Dion Chrys. Orat. xxxvi.

Grecian colony in Scythia, on the right bank of the

Hypanis, 240 stadia (Anon. I.e.: 200 stadia, Strab.

p. 200; 15 M. P., Plin. /. c.) from its moulh, the

ruins of which are now found at a place on the W.

bank of the Bug, called Stomogil, not far from

the village flgiiukoje, about 12 Eng. miles below

Sicholaev. This important settlement, which was

situated among the Scythian tribes of the Callipidae

and Alazones, owed its origin to the Ionic Miletus

in B. c. 655. (Anon. PeripL I. c.; Euseb. Clirvn.)

At an early period it became a point of the highest

importance for the inland trade, which, issuing from

thence, was carried on in an easterly and northern

direction as fax as Central Asia. It was visited by

Herodotus (iv. 17, 18, 53, 78), who obtained his

valuable information about Scythia from the Greek

traders of Olbia. From the important series of in­

scriptions in Bockh's collection {Inter. 2058—

2096), it appears that this city, although at times

dependent upon the Scythian or Sarmatian princes,

enjoyed the privileges of a free government, with

institutions framed upon the Ionic model. Among

its eminent names occur those of Poseidonius (Suidas,

r.), a sophist and historian, and Sphaeius the

stoic, a disciple of Zeno of Citium. (Plut. Cleom.

date of the famous inscription (Bijckh, No. 2058)
