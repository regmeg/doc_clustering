876 SALA.

SALAMIS.

it was doubted whether the Suites colonised Attica,

or the Athenians Sais; and Diodorus says incon-

histently, in one passage, that Sais sent a colony to

Athens (i. 28. § 3), and in another (v. 57. § 45)

that it was itself founded by Athenians. The prin­

cipal value of these statements consists in their

establishing the Graeco-Aegyptian character of the

Saite people.

The ruins of Sais consist of vast heaps of brick,

mingled with fragments of granite and Syenite

marble. Of its numerous structures the position

of one only can be surmised. The lake of Sa-tl-

Ifatljttr, which is still traceable, was at the back of

the temple of Keith: but it remains for future

travellers to determine the sites of the other sacred

or civil .structures of Sais. (Champollion, VKtjypte,

vol. ii. p. 219; Id. Lettres, 50—53; Wilkinson, Sod.

Egypt and Thebes.) [W. B. f).]

SALA (SaAas). 1. A river in Germany, be­

tween which anil the Rhine, according to Strain)

(vii, p. 291). Drasus Germanicu* lost his life.

That the river was on the east of the Rhine is im­

plied nlso in the account which Livy (Kpit. 140)

and [Mod Caasius give of the occurrence; and it has

therefore been conjectured with some probability

that the Sala is the same river as the modern

Saale, a tributary of the Kibe, commonly called the

Thuriftrjuni Saale; though others regard the Sala

as identical with the Y.tsei

2. A river of Germany, alluded to by Tacitus

(Ann. xiii. 57), who, without mentioning its name,

calls it " rlumen gignendo sale fecundum." It formed

tlit* boundary between the country of the Chatti and

Heruiuiiduri and near its banks were great salt­

works, about which these two tribes were perpetually

involved in war. From this circumstance it is clear

that the river alluded to by Tacitus is none other

but the Saale in Krnnconia, a tributary of the Hoc-

nns or Main ; and that the salt-springs are, in all

probability, those of the modern town of Kutmgen,

3. A town in Upper Pannonia, on the road from

Sabaria to Poetovium (Ptol. ii. 15. § 4: It. Ant.

p. 262, where it is called Salle; Gcogr. Kav. iv.

19, where it is called Sal la). Some identify

the place with the town of Stala Kgerssek. and

others with Lririr on the river Stala. (Comp.

Mucliar, Xoricum, i. p. 2G1.)

4. A town in the south-western part of Phrygia,

on the frontiers of Carta and Pisidia, on the north­

west of Cibyra, (Plot v. 2. § 26.)

5. A town in the north-western part of Armenia

Minor, on the eastern slope of Mount Moachua.

SALA (2aAa, Ptol. ii. 4. § 12), a town of the

Turdetani in Hisjmnia Baetica between Ptucci and

Nabrissa. [T.H. D.]

SALA (2dAa, Ptol. iv. I. § 2; Plin, v. 1), a

town of Mauretania, on the \V. coast of Africa,

situated near a river of the same name, M noticed by

tin* Romans as the extreme object of their power

and almost of their geography." (Gibbon, c. i.) In

tlie Antonine Itinerary the name occurs as Sala-

conia. which has been supposed to be a corruption of

Sala Colonia ; but from the Vienna MS. it appears

that the word "coiiia" has been inserted by a later

hand. (/tin. Anton, ed. Part hey, p. 3.) The mo­

dern Sid or Salle*7, near the mouth of the river Bu-

Regr&bt retains the name, though the site of the

ancient town must lie sought at Rabat, on the S.

side of the river, where there are Roman remains.
