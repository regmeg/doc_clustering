g.vus, in the neighbourhood of Abdera. (Strab.

xii. p. 5-19.) In this passage, however, Strabo calls

them Sapae (Sairai), and assumes their identity

with the Sinti, which in another place (x. p. 457)

he treats as a mere matter of conjecture. The Via

K_'iia:ia ran through tlu'ir country, and especially

through a narrow and difficult defile called by Ap*

pian (B. C. iv. 87, 106) the pax* of the Sapaei, and

Mated by him to he 18 miles from Philippi; so that

it must bare been nearly midway between Neapolis

and Abdera. The Sapaei are mentioned, and merely

mentioned, by Herodotus (vii. 110) and by Pliny

(iv. II, s. 18). Their town is called Sapaica

(lawaXrft) bv Stepli. B. (s. v.). [J. R-]

SAPAICA. [Sapam.]

SAPARNUS (San-a/jfos), a small tributary of

the Indus, in the upper Punjab, noticed by Arrian

(Indie, c. 4). It is probably the present Abba-

sin. [V.]

SAPAUDIA. This name occurs in Ammianus

Marcellintu (xv. 11), in his description of Gallia.

He says of the Rhone that after flowing through the

Lake of Geneva " per Sapaudiam fertur et Sequanos."

In the Notit. Imp. we read: u in Gallia Ripense prae-

fectos militurn Barcarionun Ebruduni Sapeudiae,"

where Ebrudunum appear! to be Yrerdim, which is

at one end of the Lake of Neufchatel. In another

passage of the Notit. there occurs : *' tribunus cohor-

tis primae Sapaudiae Flariae Calaraoe," or "Cula-

rone," which is Grenoble [Cclako]. Thus Sapau-

dia extended northward into the country of the

Helvetia and southward into the territory of the

Allobroges. The name Sapandia is preserved in

Saboia, or Savin/, but in a much more limited signifi­

cation ; and in the country now called Savoy there

is said to be a canton which bears the particular name

of Savoy. (D* Anville, Notice, t/c.) [G. L.]

SAPHAR [Safphar.]

SAPHE. [Bezabda.]

SAPHRI (2a^i), a small village of Parthyene

mentioned by Esidorui (Sloth. Forth, c. 12). It

may be the same place as that called by Ptolemy

2,6p€a (vi. 9. § 6), wliich he places in Hyrcania,

close to the AsUbeni. Forbiger identities it with

the modem Skaffri. [V.]

^,a.Tic*iprtwn ri)rros, Ptol. iv. 5. § 77; 2aT<p€ipTjM7,

Stepli. B. s. t\), an island in the Arabian gulf, NE.

of Myos Honnos and S. of the promontory Pharan,

from which sapphires were obtained accordiug to

Stephanua. Now Shedtuui.

SAPIS (2am y, Strab.: San'o), a small river of

Cisalpine Gaul, not far from the frontiers of Um-

hria. It rises in the Umbrian Apennines, a few

miles above Sarsina, flows under the walls of that

town, and afterwards, pursuing a course nearly due

N., crones the Aemilian Way close to the town of

Caeseua (Cesena). and falls into the Adriatic about

10 miles S. of Ravenna. (Strab. v. p. 217; Plin.

iii. 15. s. 20; Lucan. ii. 406; Sit. Ital. viii. 448;

Tab. Petit.) It is called in the Tabula Sabis; and

the name is written laapia in several editions of

Lucan and Strabo; but there seems little doubt that

fcvipis is the true form of the name. It is still called

the Savio. There can be little doubt that the S.v-

PUflA Tnuirs, mentioned by Livy (xxxi. 2, xxxiii.

37), as one of the tribes or divisions of the Umbrian

nation, immediately adjoining the Gaulish' tribe of

the Bi»ii, derived its name from the Sapis, and most

have dwolt on the banks of that river. [E. H B.]

SAPPHAB METROPOLIS (Zawfdpa. ^rP6-\

Homeritae (vi. 6. § 25). which Bothart i"
