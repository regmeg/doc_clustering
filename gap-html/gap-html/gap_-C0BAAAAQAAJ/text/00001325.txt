TURRIS LIBYSSONIS. TUSCULUM. 1241

TURRIS LIBYSSONIS (.Tlipyot Anffcrowot,

nl.: Porlo Torre*), a town of Sardinia, and appa-

itly one of the most considerable in the island. It is

oated on the N. coaatabont 15 miles E. of the Gor-

anian promontory (the Capo del Falcone'), and on

■ spacious bay nowcallwl G offodeW Asmara. Pliny

U na it was a Roman colony, and we may proba-

'infer from ita name that there was previously no

*n on the spot, bnt merely a fort or caste] I um.  
lis. iii. 12. a. 17.) It is noticed also by Ptolemy

il in the Itineraries, bnt without any indication

it il was a place of any importance. (Ptol. iii. 3.

5; /fiV Ant. p. 83.) But the nncient remains

II existing prove that it must have been a consi-

nible town under the Roman Umpire: and we learn

an the inscriptions on ancient milestones that the

incipal road through the island ran directly from

iraha to Turris, a sufficient proof that the latter

« a place much frequented. It was also an cpis-

nal see during the early part of the middle ages.

In existing port at Porto Torres, which ia almost

holly artificial, is based in great part on Roman

nidations; and there exist also the remains of a

nH*V (which, as we learn from an inscription, was

Pirated to Fortnne, and restored in the reign of

nilij.), of thermae, of a basilica and an aqueduct,

t well as a bridee over the adjoining small river,

:!'. called the Fiume Turrilano. The ancient city

intinnrd to be inhabited till the 11th century, when

« f rratcr part of the population migrated to Sw­

an, about 10 miles inland, and situated on a hill.

Ins is still the second city of the island. (Oe la

"I I'SCA'NIA {Eth. Tuscaniensis: 7W«ne«a), a

and Satumia, bnt in a manner that would afford

little clue to its true position were it not identified

by the resemblance of name with the modem 7Vmco>

nella. (Plin. iii. 5. s. 8; 7ofl. Pent.) The name

is found in an inscription, which confirms its mu­

nicipal rank. (Murat. Inner, p. 328.) Bnt it up-

pears to have been in Roman times an obscure town,

and we find no allusion to it as of ancient Etrus­

can origin. Yet that it was so is rendered probable

by the tombs that liave been discovered on the site,

and some of which contain sarcophagi and other

relics of considerable interest; though none oftlie.se

appear to be of very early date. The tombs have

been carefully examined, and the antiquities pre­

served by a resident antiquary, Sig. Campanari, a

circumstance which has given some celebrity to the

name of Totcanelta, and led to a very exasperated

estimate of the importance of Tuscania, which was .

apparently in ancient times never a place of any

consideration. It was probably during the period

of Etruscan independence a dependency of Tar­

quinii. The only remains of ancient buildings aro

some fragments of reticulated masonry, undoubtedly

of the Roman period. (Dennis's Etrnria, vol. i. pp.

440—460.) [E. H. B.]

4c: Adj. Ttisculus, Tib. i. 7. 57; Stat. Si7r. iv.

4. 16; Tusculanensis, Cic. Fam. ix. 6: Frascati

and 11 Tuscolo), a strong and ancient city of La-

tinm, lying on the hills which form a continuation

of Mount Albanus on the \V. When Dionysius of

Halicarnassus (x. 20) places it at a distance of 101)

stadia, or 12 \ miles, from Rome, he does not speak

with his accustomed accuracy, since it was 120

stadia, or 15 miles, from that city by the Via

Latina. Josephus {Ant. xviii. 7. S 6) places the

imperial villa of Tiberius at Tuscnlum at 100 stadia

from Home, which, however, lay at some distance to

the W. of the town. Festus (a. r. 7u*coi) makes Tus-

culnm a diminutive of Tuscus, but there is but slight

authority to connect the town with the Etruscans.

According to common tradition, it was founded by

Telegonus, the son of Ulysses and Circe; and henco

we find ita name paraphrased in the Latin poets as

"Telegoni moenia " (Ov. Fast. iii. 91, iv. 71; Prop,

iii. 30. 4; SiL It. xii. 535) and '■ Circaea moenia"

(Hor. A/wo", i. 30); and the hill on which it stood

called " Telegoni juga parriridae " (Id. Oof iii. 29.

8), "Circaeum dorsum" (Sil. It. vit. 691), and

"Telegoni jugera" (Stat Silv. 1.3. 83). Thus

Tusculum did not claim so remote an nri;in as

many other Latin cities; and. as being founded a

generation after the Trojan War, Virgil, a learned

antiquary, consistently omits all notice of it in his

Aeneid. The author of the treatise entitled Origo

Gentis Romanae mentions that it was made a de­

pendency or colony of Alba by Latinos Silvias (c. 17.

§ 6). After the destruction of Alba by Tnllua

Hostilius it appears to have recovered its independ­

ence, and to have become a republic under the go­

vernment of a dictator.
