I29S VIA EGXATIA VIA EGNATIA

a mere conjecture, which cannot be supported by any

authority. We may, however, make some approxi­

mation towards ascertaining the date of its con-

struction, or, at all events, that of a portion of it.

Strabo, in the passage cited at the head of thi.s

article, says that Polyoma estimated the length of

the via, between the coast of the Adriatic and the

city of Thessalonica, at 267 Human miles; whence it

appears that this portion of it at least was extant in

tin; time of Polybius. Consequently, as that historian

flourished in the first half of the 2nd century B.C,

we may infer with tolerable certainty that the read

must have been commenced shortly after the reduc­

tion of Macedonia by the Romans in n. c. 168.

Whether the eastern portion of the road, namely,

that between Thessalonica and Cypsela, a town 10

miles beyond the left, or K., bank of the Hebrus,

was also completed in the time of Polyoma, is a

jH-int which c.nmot be so satisfactorily ascertained.

For although Strabo, in the same passage, after men­

tioning the length of the road, from its commence­

ment to its termination at Cypsela, proceeds to say

that, if we follow Polybius, we must add 178 stadia

to make up the number of Human miles, because that

writer computed 8 stadia and 2 plethra, or 8J

.stadia, to the Roman mile, instead of the usual com­

putation of exactly 8; yet Strabo may then be

shaking only of the historian's general practice,

without any reference to this particular road. And,

on the whole, it may perhaps be the more probable

conclusion that the eastern portion of the road was

not constructed till some time after the Romans had

been in possession of Macedonia,

According to the same geographer, who is the

chief authority with regard to this via, its whole

length was 535 Roman miles, or 4280 stadia; and

although the tirst portion of it had two branches,

namely, one from Kpidamnus or Dyrrachium and

another from Apollonia, yet, from whichever of those

towns the traveller might start, the length of the

road was the same. Into the accuracy of this state­

ment we shall inquire further on. Strabo also men­

tions that the first part of the road was called in

Camlavium (<Vl KafSoovfat), and this name fre­

quently occurs in tlie Roman writers. Thus Cicero

(ad Att. iii 7) speaks of.travelling "per Canda-

viam," and Caesar (B. C. iii. 7'J) mentions it as the

direct route into Macedonia. It does not, however,

very clearly appear to how much of the road this

name was applicable. Tal'el, who has written a

work on the Via Kgnatia, is of opinion that the

appellation of Candavia may be considered to extend

from the commencement of the via, including the

two hianches from Dyrrachinm and Apo)Ionia, to the

town of Lyehnidus. (//e \'ia mil. Rem. Egnatia,

Proleg. p. xcix. Tubing. 1842.) But this limitation

is entirely arbitrary, and unsupported by any au­

thority; and it would perhaps be ajuster inference

from the words of Strabo to assume that the name

Candavia" was applicable to the road as far as

Thessalonica, as Col. Leake appears to have done.

(Xorthtm Greece, vol. iii. p. 311.) The point to

he. determined is, what does Strabo mean by " the

first part?" The road in its whole extent he says

is called 11 Via Egnatia," and the rirst part "in

Candaviam" ('H /j.iv oOv woura 'Eyvarta jraAcrnu,

H 5e irpdrri) i*\ Kai'daovtas Aiycrai, k.t. A.); and

from what follows it is evident that he contemplated

the division of the parts at Thessalonica, since he

gives the separate measurement as far as that town,

which is just half the whole length of the road.

We will consider the road as far as Tbesai*cks.

or the Via Candavia, first, and then proceed te *j»

remainder of the Egnatian Way. Strabo (L c. and

p. 326) lays down the general direction of t&* raai

as follows: After passing Mount Candavia. it na le

the towns of Lyehnidus and Pylon; which last,at

its name implies, was the border town fcet*»ea

Illyria and Macedonia. Her.ce it proceeded b* nar-

nus to Heracleia, and on through the temtorrerfu*

Lynceatae and Eordaei through Edessa and Pefiati

Thessalonica. The whole extent of this liae. as w

have already seen, was 2b7 Roman mile*; and :ka

computation will be found to a«nee pretty acrai^

with the distance between Dyrrathtum ana Twt*-

lonica as laid down in the Antonio* Itinerary. &r~

The ditTerence of 2 miles probably aru-es hi

The last-named work give* 307 miles as te? avi

or 38 miles more than the route between Ihrncfi^a

and the latter town. Both these routes carte a-

tance from Apollonia to Clodiana was 49
