jnat described were two sacred myrtles, which were

characterised by distinctive appellations as patricia

and plebeia. Bat, to have faced the Porticus Vip-

aania, Martial's house must not only have been

situated on the western side of the Quirinal, but also

towards its southern extremity; which likewise

appears from what has been said in the preceding

section respecting the route from it to that of his

friend Pliny being through the Subura and Vicus

Cyprius j for this would have been a roundabout

way had Martial dwelt towards the northern part of

the hill.

All these circumstances tend to show that Kama's

Capitol must have stood on the spot before indicated,

and the temple of Flora a little to the N. of it. The

part of the hill which it occupied was probably that

called Latiaris in the Argive fragments. The

part styled CoLLIS Sahtakis must have been

that near the gate of the same name, derived from

the ancient Sacellum of Salus, which stood near

it; in place of which a regular Temple of Salvs

was dedicated by C. Junius Bubulcus, n. c. 203

(Liv ix. 43, x. 1). and adorned with paintings by

Fabius Pictor. These were still to be seen in the

time of Pliny, when the temple was destroyed by

fire in the reign of Claudius (xxxv. 7; cf. VaL

Max. viii. 14. § 6).

Cicero's friend At ticus lived close to the temple of

Salus ("—tuae vicinae Salutis," ad Att. iv. 1), and

at the same time near that of Quirinus: "Certe non

longe a tuis aedibus inambulana post excc.ss.mn

smim Romulus Proculo .Julio dixerit, se deum esse

et Quirinum vocari, tcmplnmque sibi dedicari in eo

loco jusserit." (Dc Leg. i. 1.) The vicinity of the

temples is likewise indicated in another passage rela­

ting to a statue of Caesar, which had been erected

in that of Quirinus: "De Caesare vicino scripseram

ad te, quia cognoram ex tuis Uteris; cum uvvvaav

Quirino inalo quam Saluti" (ad Att. xii. 4o).

Hence the sites of the two temples in question are

still further established. For as that of Salus lay

on the N. side of the hill, near the Porta Salntaris,

and that of Quirinus some 200 yards to the S. of it,

at the church of 5. Andrea, so we may assume that

the house of Atticus lay between the two, and he

would thus he a close neighbour to both.

Another ancient sacraiium on the Quirinal was

that of SeMO Sancts or Dius Funus. We have

shown, when treating of the Servian gates, that the

PortaSanqualis took its name from this sacellum: and

Livy (viii. 20) describes it as facing the temple of

Quirinus. Hence it must have stood on or near the

site of the Palazzo Quirinale, l>etwecn the temple of

Salus and that of Flora. It had a perforated roof,

for the deity loved the open air, whence his title of

Dins; and some thought that no oath by this god

should be sworn under a roof. (Varr. L, /,. v. §

6(1.) Sancus was an old Sabine deity, and his

temple at Home appears to have been founded by

Tatms. (Ov. Fast vi. 213; Prop. v. 9. 74; Tcr-

tuli. ad Nat. ii. 9.) Its antiquity is attested by the

circumstance that the distaff and sandals of Tana-

quit, tlie wife of Tarquinius Priscus, are recorded to

have been preserved in it, and are said to have

been in existence down to the time of Augustus.

(Plin. viii. "4; Plut. Q. R. 30.) It appears to

have been rebuilt by Tarquinius Superbus, but its

dedication was reserved for Sp. Post urn i us. (Dionys.

ix. 60.) The part of the hill where it stood must

have been the Collis Mucialis of tho Argive

fragments. (Varr. v. § 52.)
