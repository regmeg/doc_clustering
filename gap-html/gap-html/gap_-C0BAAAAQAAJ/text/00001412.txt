farther south, opposing Germanicus on Iiis return

from the country of the Marsi. (Tac Ann. i. 50,

In Strabo (vii. p. 292) they appear under the name

of O&nmu, and Ptolemy (ii. 11. § 10) mentions a

tribe of tlie name of Oviavo't, whom some believe to

be the same as* the Usipetes; but if this be correct,

it would follow that the U.Mpetes migrated still

farther south, as Ptolemy places the>c Vis-pi on the

up|x?r Rhine; but as no other authority places them

so far south, the question is altoge'her uncertain.

About the year A. d. 70, the U.Mpetes took part in

tlie siege of Moguntiacum (Tac. Ann. xiii. 54), and

in a. i>. 83 a detachment of them is mentioned as

serving in the Roman army in Britain. (Id. Agr'ic.

27.) Afterwards they disappear from history.

xxix. 35; Caes. B. C. ii. 36), a colony founded by

the Tyrians on the N. coast of Zeugitana in Africa.

(Veil. Pat. i. 2; Mela, i. 7; Justin, xviii. 4, &c.)

The date of its foundation is said to have been a few

years alter that of Gades, and 287 years before that

of Carthage. (Veil. Pat. /. c.; Aristot Mirab.

Ante. 140; (ler-eiiins, Monnm Scrijif. Lxnguaeque

Phoenic. p. 291 ; Sil. Ital Pun. iii. 241, sqq. &c)

Its name signified in Phoenician, "ancient," or

"noble" (np^ny- Gcsen. ib. p. 420, and The*. Ling.

Ihb* p. 1085). Utica was situated near the mouth

of the river Bagradas, or rather that of its western

arm, in the Bay of Carthage, and not far from the

promontory of Apollo, which forms the western

boundary of the bay. (Strab. xvii. p. 832; Liv.

c; Ptol. L c.; App'ian, B. C. ii. 44, seq.; Procop.

B. V. ii. 15, &c.) It lay 27 miles N\V. of Car­

thage. (Itin. Ant. p. 22.) The distance is given

as 60 stadia in Appian (Pun. 75), which is pro­

bably an error for 160; and as a (lay's sail by sea.

(Scylax, Geogr. Min. i. p. 50, ed. Huds.) Both

Utica and Tunes might be descried from Cartilage.

(Strab. /. c.; Polyb. i. 73; Liv. xxx. 9.) Utica

}M)ssessed a good harbour, or rather harbours, made

by art, with excellent anchorage and numerous landing

places. (Appian, /. c.; cf. Bartb, Wandtrtmgen

durch die Kuxtmlinder de.3 MUfchneers, pp. Ill,

125.) On the land side it was protected by steep

hills, which, together with the sea and its artificial de­

fences, which were carefully kept up, rendered it a very

strong place. (Liv. xxix. 35; App. Pun. 16, 30, 75;

Diod. xx. 54; Plut.Cat. Min. 58.) The surrounding

country was exceedingly fertile and well cultivated,

and produced abundance of corn, of which there

was a great export trade to Komo. (Liv. xxv. 31.) I

i The billd behind the town, as well « tie £*5vt

near the present Porto Farina* contained rich t;a
