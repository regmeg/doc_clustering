was made their sepulchre after their executions

(Josh. x. 16—28.) It is placed by Euselius

(Onomast. s. v.) 8 miles east of Eleutheropolis.

[Betiiogabris.] [G. W.]

MALA (Mi\a, Md\»)), a town in Colchis, which

Scylax (p. 32), in contradiction to other writers,

makes the birthplace of Medeia. [K. B. J.]

MALACA (MdAaxa, Strab.; Ptol. ii. 4. § 7;

MaAaVn, Steph. B. s. v.: Eth. MaAaxrrai'o'f: Ma-

iaga), an important town upon the coast of Hispania

Baetica, cast of Calpe, which was equidistant from

Gadeira and Malaca. (Strab. iii. p. 156.) Ac­

cording to the Antonine Itinerary (p. 405), the dis­

tance from Gadeira to Malaca was 145 miles; ac­

cording to Strabo (iii. p. 140) the distance from

Gadeira to Calpe was 750 stadia. Malaca stood

upon a river of the same name, now Gvadalmedina.

(Avien. Or. Mar. 426 j Malaca cum fluvio, Plin. iii.

1. s. 3.) Strabo says (/. c.) that Malaca was built

in the Phoenician fashion, whence we may conclude

that it was a Phoenician colony. Accordingly some

modern writers have supposed that the name was

derived from the Phoenician word malcha, " royal;"

hut Humboldt says that Malaca is a Basque word,

signifying the "side of a mountain." Under the

Romans it was a foederata civitas (I'lin. I. c), and

had extensive establishments for salting fish. (Strab.

I c.) Avienus says (I. c.) that Malaca was for­

merly called Maenaca; bnt Strabo had already no­

ticed this error, and observed not only that Maenaca

was further from Calpe, but that the ruins of the

latter city were clearly Hellenic. Malaca is also

mentioned in Strab. iii. pp. 158, 161, 163; Hut.

B. Alex. 46; Geogr. Kav. iv. 42. There are still

a few remains of Roman architecture in Malaga.

MALACHATH (MoAaxdfl), a city of Libya In­

terior, which Ptolemy (iv. 6. § 25) places in the

country above the Nigeir, in E. long. 20° 20', and

K. lat. 20° 15'. [E. B. J.]

MALAEA. [Malea.]

MALAEI COLON (MoAaloo.or MaA<ov k»\oi>,

Ptol, vii. 2. § 5), a promontory on the southern

coast of the Golden Chersonesus. Its exact posi­

tion cannot be determined, but it was probably along

the Straits of Malacca. [V.]

MALAMANTUS (4 MaAduajToj, Arrian, Ind.

c 4), a small tributary of the Cophen, or river of

Kolml, perhaps now the Pandjcora. [V.]

MALANA (MiAoj-a, Arrian, Ind. c 25), a

cape which enters the Indian Ocean, and forms the

western boundary of the Oreitae (one of the sea-

coast tribes of Gedrosia) and the Ichthyophagi.

There is no doubt that it is the same as the present

C. Malan in Mtkran, the measurements of Xearchus

and of modem navigators corresponding remarkably.

(Vincent, \'<»j. of Xearchus, vol. i. p. 216.) IV.]

MALANGA (MdAoyya, Ptol. vii. 1. § 92), the

chief town of the Arvarni, a tribe who inhabited the

eastern side of llindostan, below where the Tyndis

(now Kisttia) flows into the sea. It has been sup­

posed that it is the same place as the present

Madras, but it may liave been a little higher up

near XelUirt. [V.]

MALAO (MoAda, Ptol. iv. 7. § 10. com. Mi-

Atwt), probably answers to the modern Berbera, the

chief town of the Somiileh, who inhabit the western

coast of Africa from the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb to

cape Guardafui. This district has in all times been

the seat of an active commerce between Africa and

Arabia, and Malao was one of the principal marts

lor gums, myrrh, frankincense, cattle, slaves, gold-

dust and ivory. (See Heeren, African Xatimt,

vol. i. p. 330, Engl. transL) [W. B I>]

MALATA. according to an inscription, or Miuta

according to the Peuting. Table, a place in Pannxu*

Inferior, on the Danube. As the inscriptioo vrae

found at Peterxcardein, MaUla was perhaps sita-

ated at or near the latter place. (Gear. Rsv. ir.

19; Marsilius, Danub. ii. p. 118, tab. 47.) [L.S.]

MALCHUBII. [Mauketasul]

MALCOAE. [Mandicls.]

MA'LEA (MoA«'a), a town in the district of

Aegytis in Arcadia, the inhabitants of which wow

transferred to Megalopolis upon the foundation of

the latter city. (Paus, viii. 27. § 4.) Its territory

was called the Maleatis (^ MaAfaru). Xen .ph.*i

describes Lcuctra as a fortress situated above tb*

Maleatis; and as Leuctra was probably at or Dear

Leotvldri, Malea must have been in the same Dcirb-

bourhood. [Leuctka.] Leake, however, connertifur,

Malea with the river Mali's (MoAoor, Paus. vm.

35. § 1), a tributary of the Aipheius, places the)

town on this river, and on the mad from MeesJo-

polis to Carnasium (Leake, Peloponnesiaca, p.24S);

but this is not probable. The place Midea (MaSca)

mentioned by Xenophon (Hell. vii. 1. § 28) is pro­

bably a corrupt form of Malea. (Curtius, Ptlopon-

nesos, vol. i. p. 336.)

MA'LEA (MoAe'a, Steph. B.«.r. etalii; MoAmi,

Herod, i. 82; Strab. viii. p. 368), still called MaJia,

a promontory of Laconia, and the most southerly

point in Greece with the exception of Taenarum.

For details see Vol. II. p. 114.

> MA'LEA (MoAto, Thucyd. in. 4,6; Xeo. Hett. L

6. §§ 2C, 27; MoAia, Strab. xiii. p. 617; Maria,

Ptol. v. 2; 6ee Schol. ad A ristoph. Ilan. p. 33), the

southernmost point of the island of Lksiuw*, reck­

oned by Strabo to be 70 stadia distant from Myti-

lene, 560 stadia from Cape Sigrium, and 340 from

Methymna. Immediately opposite, on the mainland,

were the point of Cake and the islands of Aluai*

Ki'SAE [seo those articles]. The modern nan* of

Malea is Ztitoun Bourowi, or Cape Sl Mary, and

it is a high and conspicuous point at sea. Xeno­

phon says (/. c.) that the fleet of Callicratida* oc­

cupied this station before the sea-fi^ht off Areinu>ae.

There is some obscurity in Xenophon's topography in

reference to this place; and the Malea of Thacr-

dides (I. c.) can hardly have been C. SL Maty,

unless there is some error in his relation, lie aa»»

distinctly (c. 4.), that Malea lay to the north J

Mytilene, and (c 6.) that the Athenians had

their market there, while Ik-sieging the city. Tb*

first statement is inconsistent with the position of

Cape St. Maty, and the second with ita distance

from Mytilene. Possibly the Malea of Thoerdnle*

had some connection with the sanctuary of Apullo

Malocis. (See the notes of Arnold and Poppa, and

Thirlwall's Greece, vol. iii. p. 173.) [J. S. H.]

MA'LEA (MoAm, or MoAoia toot, PtoL viL 4.

§ 8), a large group of mountains in the southern

part of the ancient Taprobane or CeyUm. There

can be little doubt that it comprehends the mountain

tract now known by the name of Xetcrra Elba, one

of the chief mountains of which is called, from the

Arabs, Adam's Peak, by the natives Sripada. Pto­

lemy states, that it is the water-abed of three riim,

which he calls the Soanas, the Asanas, and the

Baraces, and describes with remarkable truth the

present condition of the island, when he adds that

in the low ground below it, towards the sea, are the

pastures of the elephants. Pliny speaks of a moon­
