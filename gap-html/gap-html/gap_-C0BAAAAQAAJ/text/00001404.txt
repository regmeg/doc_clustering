1320 VOLCAE. VOLCEITOL

ties. Among these the most conspicuous arc the

sepulchral urns, or rather chests, for ashes, resembling

small sarcophagi, and generally formed of alabaster,

a material which is quarried in the immediate neigh­

bourhood. Many of them are adorned with sculp­

tures and bas-reliefs, some of them purely Etruscan

in character, others taken from the Greek mythology,

and there is no doubt that many of them belong to a

period long after the f:ill of Etruscan independence.

The inscriptions are for the most part merely sepul­

chral.and of little interest; but those of one family are

remarkable aa preserving to us the original Etruscan

form (Ceicna) of the well-known family of the Cae-

cinae, who figure frequently in Roman history [Cae-

riMA, Biogr. DictJ]. Indeed, the tirst of this family of

whom we have any knowledge — the Aulus Caecir.a

defended by Cicero in B.C. 69 — was himself a native

of Yolaterrae (Cic. pro Caec. 7). His son was the

author of a work on the " Etruscan discipline," which

is frequently referred to as a valuable source of in­

formation in regard to that, department of antiquities

(Cic ad Fam. vi. 6; PHn. i. Arg. Lib. ii; Senec.

Nat. QuaesL ii. 39).

There is no doubt that Volatcrrae in the days of

its independence possessed an extensive territory.

Strabo distinctly tells us (v. p. 223) that its territory

extended down to the sea-coast, where the town of

Vada, or as it was called for distinction's sake,

Vada Volaterrana, constituted its sea-port. It

was not indeed a harbour or port in the strict sense

of the word; but a mere roadstead, where the shoals,

from which it derived its name, afforded a good

anchorage and some shelter to shipping. Hence it

was, in tiie Roman times, a frequented station for

vessels proceeding along the coast of Etruria (Cic.

pro Quinct.G: Plin.iii.5.s 8; /fin. Marti, p. 501);

and Kutilius, in particular, has left us an exact de­

scription of the locality (Rutil. /tin. i. 453—462).

The site is still marked by a mediaeval tower on the

coast, called Torre di Vada.

The coins of Yolaterrae are numerous, and belong

to the class called Aes Grave, from their large size

and weight; but they are distinguished from all

other Etruscan coins of this class by their having

the name of the city in full; whence we learn that

the Etruscan form of the name was Felathri,

or Yelatiuu, as on the one of which a figure is

annexed. [E. H. B.]

0015 OF VOLATERRAB.

VOLCAE, a people of South Gallia, divided into

Volcae Arecomici and Volcae Tectosages (QvoKkvu

'Aptuduiot, Ouo\k<xi TeKTotrdyes, Ptol. ii. 10.§§9,10;

OvwKttat 'ApiKouMTKoi, Strabo).

Ptolemy says that the Tectosages occupied the

most western parts of the Narbonensis, and that

these are their cities: llliberis, Ruscino, Tolosa

Colonia, Cessero, Carcaso, Baeterrae, and Narbo

Colonia. Next to them and extending to the Rhone lie

places the Arecomici, or AricomU, as the name is

Lu Ptolemy's text; and he assigns to the Arccoinii

only Vindomagns [Vn«x>MAGr<] and femw

Colonia (A'vmes). These two nations ore3p*i ul

the Provincia from the Rhone to it* wt:<n '^L'^.

and if Eivy is not mistaken (xxi. 26V *i v.

time of Hannibal's invasion of Italy, the Y«c*e

also possessions east of the Kkc*u.

The Cebenna (CVreme*) formed a car^il

boundary between the Volcae Areonmia tad T>

Gabali and Ruteiri. As to the limits berwr?;; t>

Teetosa^es and the Arecomici there is £r**l dife. ..tj.

for while Ptolemy assigns Narbo to toe Teciosk-tv

Strabo (iv. p. 203) says that Narbo is the p-rt« i:t

Arecomici; and it is clear that he sipp-ftei

Arecomici to have possessed the greater p&.rt n >

Provincia. which is west of the Rhone, asd Vx& *

limited the country of the Tectosages to: heparin <-a

is in the basin of the Garonne. He mike* tiie T*-

tosages extend also northwards to the Or*MKf.» 'M

western prolongation of this ranffe. The chiet ci* i

the Arecomici was Nemausu> [Nemaoc*-]. *££ti*

chief city of the Tectosages was Tolosa; *al

Narbo belonged to the Arecomici, we must 'una: a*

Tolosates, as already observed, to the batiti d tt<

Garonne. [Narbo; Tolosa.]

There is some resemblance between th?

Volcae and Belgae, and there is some little fvjims

that the Volcae were once named Below or Bfv^e.

But it would be a hasty conclusion from this rt-

semblance to assume a relaiiimship or identity iv-

tween these Volcae and the Belize of the oarfe i

Gallia, There was a tradition thst sorr* cc n*

Volcae Tectosages had once settled in Oer^tc

about the Hercynia Silva; and Caesar (E.G. ti. 241

affirms, but. only from hearsay, that tbs-e W^x

in his time still maintained themselves in

parts of Germany, and that they had ao h-;ix^f

diameter and great military reputation. H<

that they lived like the other Germans. Tt* Tk-
