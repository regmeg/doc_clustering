his, to whom a temple was built there by the Per-

sians in commemoration of a victory over the Sacae.

The chief priest of this temple was regarded as the

sovereign of Zela and its territory (ZijAifTij). Not­

withstanding thin, however, it remained a small

place until Pompey, after his victory over Mithri-

dates, raised it to the rank of a city by increasing

its population and extending its walls. Zcla is ce­

lebrated in history for a victory obtained in its

vicinity by MitbriHatcs over the Itomans under

Triarius, and still more for the defeat of Pharnaces,

about which Caesar sent to Koine the famous report

"Veni, Vidi, Vici." (Plin. vi. 3; Appinn, ilithrid.

89; PluL Cats. 50; Dion Cass. xlii. 47, where the

place is erroneously called Z..\«a; lint. BelL Alex.

ated at a distance of four days" journey (according

to the Peut. Table 80 miles) from Tavium, and

louth-east of Amasia. The elevated ground on

which the town was situated, and which Strata calls

the mound of Semiramis, was, according to Hirtius,

a natural hill, but so shaped that it might seem to

be the work of human hands. According to Ha­

milton (Researches, i. p. 306), is a black-coloured

isolated hill rising out of the plain, and is now

crowned with a Turkish fortress, which still bears

tbe name of Zilleh. [L. S.J

ZELE1A (Z«Atio), a town of Troas, at the foot

of Mount Ida and on the banks of the river Aesepus,

at a distance of 80 stadia from its mouth. It is

mentioned by Homer (II. ii. 824, iii. 103), who calls

it a holy town. (Comp. Strab. xii. p. 565, xiii.

pp. 585, 587, 603 ; Steph. B. s. c.) Arrian (Anab. i.

13) mentions it as the head-quarters of the Persian

army before the battle of the Granicus: it existed

in the time of Strabo; but afterwards it disappears.

Some travellers have identified it with the modern

liiga, between Jkaaegee and Sorricui. [L.S.J

number of promontories, as 1. At the western ex­

tremity of the peninsula of Myndus in Caria, now

called GvmichU or Angrli. (Strab. xiv. p. 658.)

2. On the coast of Olivia, between Cilicia Trachcia

and l'edia-, a little to the west of the town ot An-

chiale- (Strab. xiv. p. 671.) It contained a fort of

Use same name, and was 120 stadia from Tarsus,

When Pliny (xxxiv. 50) states that the best molyb-

daena was prepared at Zephyrinm, he no doubt al­

ludes to this place, since we know from Dioscorides

(v. 100) that this mineral was obtained in the

neighbouring hill of Corycus, and that there it was

of excellent quality. Leake (A/in Minor, p. 214)

looks for it near the month of the river Mertin.

3. On the coast of Cilicia, near the month of the

river Calyradnus. (Strab. xiv. p. 670; Ptol. v. 8.

§3.)

4. A town on the coast of Paphlagonia, 60 stadia

to the west of Cape Carambis. (Arrian, Peripl. P. E.

p. 15; Anon. Peripl. P. E. p. 6; Ptol. v. 4. § 2.)

in the country of the Mosynoeci, 90 stadia to the

west of Tripolis. (Ptol. v. 6. § 11 ; Arrian, Peripl.

P.E. p. 17 ; Scylax, p. 33; Anon. Peripl. P. E.

p. 13; Tab. Peut.) The cape still bears the name

of Zafra or Zefreh, and Hamilton (Researches, i.

p. 261) reganls the modern Kaik Liman as occu­

pying the site of the ancient Zephvrium. [L. S.J

ZEPI1YRIU.M PKOMOXTOH1U.M (tb Ztpifiov.

Capo di Brutzano). a promontory on the E. coast

of the Bruttian peninsula between Locri and ti.o

SE. corner of Bruttium. It is mentioned principally

in connection with the settlement of the Loerian co­

lonists in this part ot Italy, whose city thence

derived the name of Locki Epizkpiitri!. Ac­

cording to Strabo, indeed, these colonists settled in

tbe first instance on the headland itself, which ha In

small port contiguous to it, but after a short time

removed to the site of their permanent city, about

15 miles farther N. (Strab. vi. pp. 259, 270.)

The Zephyrian Promontory is mentioned by all the

geographers in describing the coast of Bruttinm, and

is undoubtedly the same now called the Cajto di

Brutzano, a low but marked headland, alxmt 10

miles N. of Cape Spartivento, which forms the

SE. extremity of the Bruttian peninsula (Strab.

4. Another promontory of Cyrenaica, with a har­

bour. (Strab. xvii. p. 838.)

5. A promontory near Little Taposiris in Lower

Aegypt, having a temple of Arsinot-Aphiodite.
