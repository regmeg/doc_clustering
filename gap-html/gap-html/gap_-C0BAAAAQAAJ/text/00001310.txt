that Sardea was taken several times; first by the

Cimmerians; then by the Trerea and Lycians, as

Callinus also shows; lastly in the time of Cyrus and

Croesus." (Id. xiii. p. 627). "In olden times, it

held the Magnetos [the people of Magnesia on the

Maeander] to be utterly destroyed by the Trerea,

a Cimmerian tribe." (Id. xiv. p. 647; see also xi.

p. 511, xii. p. 573; Cimmehii, Vol. I. p. 623,seq.;

Muller, Uui. Lit. Anc. Greece, pp. 108, 109; and

cf. Herod, i. 6, 15, 16, 103.)

Various attempts have been made to fix the dates

of these events; but the means of doing so appear

to be wanting, and hence scholars have arrived at

very different conclusions on the subject. Strabo

inters from some expressions of Callinus that the

destruction of Sardes preceded that of Magnesia,

which latter occurred, he considers, after 1 lie time

of that poet, and during tho age of Archil ochus,

who alludes to it.

Thucydides (ii. 96) states that the kingdom of

Sitalces was bounded on the side next to the Triballi

by the T re res and Tilataei, who dwelt on the northern

slope of Mount Scombrus (Scomius), and extended

towards the W. as far as the river Oscius (Oescus).

"Whether this relative clause applies to the Trerea

as well as to the Tilataei is doubtful; but the col­

location of tho words seems to confine it to the

latter.

Strabo (i. p. 59) speaks of the Trerea as dwelling

with the Tbracians ; and says that the Trerea, who

were Thracians, possessed a part of the Troad after

the time of Priam (xiii. p. 536).

Pliny does not mention the Trerea as a Thraeian

[teople; but in the description of Macedonia (iv. 10.

s. 17), says that they, with the Dardani and Pieres,

dwelt on its borders ; it is not clear, however, which

Imrders are meant. (Cf. Theopom. Frag, 313,

where they are called Tp«/ies; and Stepb. B. p. 664,

where also a district of Thrace inhabited by them is

named T^ijpos.)

It is possible that these Thraeian Treres were the

descendants of a body of the Cimmerian Treres, left

N. of the Haemus when tho main body advanced to

Asia Minor; for there can be little doubt that it'ie-

buhr's view residing the course of their inroads is

correct. ''The general opinion, which is presupposed

ifi Herodotus also, is that the Cimmerians invaded

A>ia Minor from the K., along the coasts of the

Kuxiue. But it would seem that, on the contrary,

they came through Thrace, for they make their first

api>earance in Ionia and Lydia. The former road is

almost entirely impassable for a nomadic people, as

the Caucasus extends to the very shores of the

Euxiiii.*." (LecL Anc. Hist. i. p. 32, note.)

In confirmation of t he conjecture above made, we

may refer to the parallel case mentioned by Caesar

(Ii. G, ii. 29), that the Aduatuci, a Belgian tribe,

were the descendants of the 6000 men whom the

Citnbri and Teutoni, on their march towards Italy,

left behind them W. of the lihine, to guard that part

of their property which they were unable to take with

them any farther. [J. R.]

TRERUS (TpTjpos, Strab.: Sacco), a river of La-

tium, and one of the principal tributaries of the Liris

(Garigluino), into which it discharges its waters

close to the ruins of Fabrateria. (Strab. v. p. 237.)

Its name is mentioned only by Strabo, but there is

no doubt of its identification: it is still called the
