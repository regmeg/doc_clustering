straight line to Barium (Bari). The remainder of

its course presents no difficulties, and the stations

are, for the most part, well-known towns. The whole

line is thus given in the Autonine Itinerary (up. 112,

11G):—

- xxi.

Egnatia {Torrt di Gnazia) -

- xvi.

Brundusium (Brindisi) - - -

- xviii.

The two stations of Turns between Barium and

Egnatia, and Speluncae between Egnatia and Brun­

dusium, cannot be identified; it is evident from the

names themselves that they were not towns, but

merely small places on the coast so called. The

Jerusalem Itinerary has two stations, Turres Aure-

lianae, and Tunes Juliae, between Egnatia and

Barium, but, from tlie distances given, neither of

these can be identified with the Turres of the Anto-

nine Itinerary. The other intermediate stations

mentioned by the same authority are unimportant Mu-

tationes, which can be identified only by a careful

survey on the spot.

The Tabula gives (though in a very confused

manner) an intermediate line of route, which appears

to have been the same as that indicated by Strabo

(v. p. 283), which quitted the coast at Egnatia,

and proceeded through Caelia to Brundusium. The

stations given are:—

Canusium to Rudiae - - - xii. m.p.

Rubi . - - . xiv.

Butuntnm - - ix.

Caelia (Cegtie) - ix.

Khetium(Azetium?) —

Egnatia - - - viii.

It is certain that the Via Trajana was continued,

probably by Trajan himself, from Brundusium to

Hydruntum (Otranto), and was thence carried

all round the Calabrian peninsula to Tarentum.

The road from Brundusium to Hydruntum pissed

through Lupiae (Lecct), in the interior of the penin­

sula, which is correctly placed 25 miles from each of

the above cities, (/(in. Ant. p. 118.) The stations

on the other line, which is given only in the Tabula,

are as follow:—

M. P.

Hydruntum to Castrum Minervae (Castro) viii.

Veretum (Sta Maria di

Vere to) ----- xii.

Uxentum (Ugento) - ~ x.

Baletium (Aletium) - - x.

N ere turn (Xardo) - - x.

Manduria (Matiduria) - xxix.

Tarentum (TararUo) - xx.

The above distances appear to be correct.

Lastly, a brunch struck off from the Via Trajana

at Barium which proceeded direct to Tarentum. It

is probable that this came to be adopted as the most

convenient mode of reaching the latter city when

the original Via Appia had foHen into disnse. T:-

distance is correctly given as 60 aula. (/t«. AtA

p. 119.)

Besides the above, which may be ccnsid?rea a* i~

in some degree branches of the Via Trajan, tirtr

was another line, probably constru-ted at a txu

period, which struck across frura Equas T cries la

Venusia, so as to form a cro>s oofniuanjcaSas fcv*
