this hero's death. (Soph. Track, passim.) It be­

came a place of historical importance in consequence

of the colony founded here by the Lacedaemonians in

the sixth year of the Peloponnosian War, n. c. 426.

The Trachinians and the neighbouring Dorians, who

suffered much from the predatory incursions of the

Oetaean mountaineers, solicited aid from the Spar­

tans, who eagerly availed themselves of this oppor­

tunity to plant a strong colony in this commanding

situation. They issued an invitation to the other

states of Greece to join in the colony; and as many

as 10,000 colonists, under three Spartan oecists,

built and fortified a new town, to which the name of

Hrracleia was given, from the great hero, whose

name was so closely associated with the surrounding

district. (Thuc. iii. 92; Diod. xii. 59.) It was

usually called the Trachinian Heracleia, to distin­

guish it from other places of the same name, and by

later writers Heracleia in Phthiotis, as this district

was subsequently included in the Thessalian Phthio­

tis. ('HpoKAcia i) iv Xen. ffell, i. 2.

The new colonists also built a port with docks near

Thermopylae. It was generally expected that this

city, under the protection of Sparta, would become a

formidable power in Northern Greece, but it was at-

tacked from the beginning by the Thessalians, who

regarded its establishment as an invasion of their

territory; and the Spartans, who rarely succeeded in

the government of dependencies, displayed haughti­

ness and corruption in its administration. Hence

the city rapidly dwindled down ; and in b. c. 420

tin; Heracleots were defeated with great loss by the

neighbouring Thessalian tribes, and Xenares, the

Lacedaemonian governor, w;ts slain in the battle.

Sparta was unable at the time to send assistance to

their colony; and in the following year the Boeotians,

fearing lest the place should fall into the hands of

the Athenians, took possession of it, and dismissed

the Lacedaemonian governor, on the ground of mis­

conduct. (Thuc. v. 51, 52.) The Lacedaemonians,

however, regained possession of the place; and in the

winter of ». c. 409—408, they exj>erienced here

another disaster, 700 of the Heracleots being slain

in battle, together with the Lacedaemonian harmcst.

(Xen. Hell i. 3. § 18.) But, after the Pcloponne-

si'an War, Heracleia again rose into importance, and

became the head-quarters of the Spartan power in

Northern Greece. In u. c. 399 Herippidas, the La­

cedaemonian, was sent thither to repress some fac­

tious movements in Heracleia; and he not only put

to deatli all the opponents of the Lacedaemonians in

the town, but expelled the neighbouring Oetaeans

and Trachinians from their abodes. (Diod. xiv. 38;

Polyaen. ii. 21.) In b. C. 395 the Thebans, under

the command of Lsmer.ias, wrested this important

place from the. Spartans, killed the Lacedaemonian

garrison, and gave the city to the old Trachinian

and Oetaean inhabitants. (Diod. xiv. 82.) The

walls of Heracleia were destroyed by Jason, lest any

state should seize this place and prevent him from

inarching into Greece. (Xen. Hell vi. 4. § 27.)

At a later time Heracleia came into the hands of the

Aetolians, and was one of the main sources of their

I«>wer in Northern Greece. After the defeat of An-

tiochus at Thermopylae, n. c 191, Heracleia was

Iwsieged by the Roman consul Acilius Glabrio, who

divided his army into four bodies, and directed his
