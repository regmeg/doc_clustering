rut of an extinct volcano, retaining only so much

■ ;t» former activity as to emit constantly sul-

•^.inntat c«--« in considerable quantity, the deposit

■* thick forms large accumulations of sulphur. It

a nU described by Slrabo, in whose time it would

i Mi liave been rather more active than at pre-

rst, at well as in a more poetical style by I'etronius

'<~«rm. B. Cia. 67—75); and is noticed also by

Ij.Itk, who justly points to the quantity of sul-

K --- ]r «i»red. as an evidence of igneous action,

taaxh long extinct. (Strab. v. p. 246; Lucil.

At* 431.) It does not seem to have ever broken

SB una more violent action, in ancient, any more

lass * modern, times; but in the middle ages

a -■•»■ occasion (in 1198) it broke into a violent

tnctina; and a stream of traehytic lava, which has

a »-l fir/en the crater in a SE. direction, is pro-

kA « the mult of this outburst. The effect of the

n.-j.'Ju.-roiM exhalations on the soil of the Burround-

PTDXA (Uiira, Scyl. p. 26; Scymn. Ch. 626;

A i. IS. i 15; Steph. B.; Plin. iv. 17), a town

Ek ary*" ':T stood on tbe coast of Picria, in the

nlf. Thernistoclea was conducted by

, u a.^.^„ guides across the mountains, and

sal a averrhaat ship about to sail for Asia. (Thuc.

BT-) Pydnm was blockaded by the

who, after prosecuting the siege in vain, concluded a

convention with Periliccas. (Thuc. i. 61.) It was

taken b. c. 411 by Archelaus, who removed its site

20 stadia from the sea. (Diodor. xiii. 49.) After­

wards it was gained for Athens by Timotheus; but

in the two first years of the disastrous Social War

(358—356), Pydna, about the exchange of which

for Amphipolis there had been a secret negotiation,

was betrayed to Philip by a party of traitors in the

town. (Demosth. adv. Leptinem, p. 476. § 71,

OlutUJi. i. p. 10. § 5, Ohjnth. ii. p. 19. § 6; Ulpian,

ad he.; Theopompus, Fr. 189, ed Didot.) Several

Athenian citizens were taken in Pydna, and sold

into slavery, whom Demosthenes ransomed from

his own funds. (Plut. Vit. X. Orator, p. 851,

vol. ix. p. 381, ed. Ileiske.) Towards the close of

the year B.C. 316, Olympias retired to Pydna,

where she was besieged by Cassander, and taken

prisoner by him. (l)ioilor. xix. 49; Polyaen. iv. 11.

§ 3.) In the spring of B.C. 169, Perseus abandon­

ing Diuin, retreated before the consul Q. Marcius

Pliilippus to Pydna. (Liv. xliv. 6.) After again

occupying the strong line of the Enipeus, Perseus,

in consequence of tho dexterous flank movement of

P. Scipio Nasica, was compelled to fall bark upon

Pydna. On the 22nd of June, B. c. 168 (an

eclipse fixes the date, Clinton, H. vol. iii. p.

82), the fate of the Macedonian monarchy was

decided in a plain near the town, which was traversed

by a small river, and bordered by heights affording a

convenient retreat and Bhelter to the light infantry,

while the plain alone contained the level ground

necessary for the phalanx. (Liv. xliv. 32 — 46;

Plut. Aemil. 13—23.) Tho Epitomiser of Strabo

and a Scholiast upon Demosthenes (Olynth. i. p.

10) assert that the Khpos of their time was the

same place as Pydna; but their authority is of no

great weight, and Colonel Leake (A'orfAem Greece,

vol. iii. pp. 429—435) has shown that the ancient

site is better represented by Aydn, where there are

Hellenic remains, and, on the slope towards the sea,

ta'o " tumuli," probably monuments of the battle.

Kitro, it may be supposed, rose upon the decay

of Pydna and Methone, between which it lies.

ii. p. 76. [E. B. J.]

PYDXAE or PYDNA (nooVoi), a small town

on the coast of Lycia, between the river Xanthus

and Cape Hieron. (Stadiatm. M. Magni, p. 221.)

It is probably the same place as the one called

by Ptolemy (v. 3. S 5) Cydna, and which he

places at the foot of Mount Cragtis, where rums of

an ancient town were observed by Beaufort (Leake,

^rin Minor, p. 182.) [L. S.]

PY'GELA or PHY'GELA {MytKa, *0yt\a:

F.th. niryeAfi/s), a small town on the coast of the

Caystrian bay, a little to the south of Kphesus, was

faid to have been founded by Agamemnon, and to

have been peopled with the remnants of his army;

it contained a temple of Artemis Munychia. (Xenoph.

HeUen, i. 2. §2; Strab. xiv. p. 639; Steph. B.r. v.;

Harpocrat. s. v.; Plin. v. 31; Scylax. p. 37; Pomp.

Mela, i. 17; Liv. xxxvii. 1.) Dioscorides (v. 12)

commends the wine of this town, which is still cele­

brated. Chandler (TraveU, p. 176) observed its

remains on a hill between Ephesus and Scala Nora,
