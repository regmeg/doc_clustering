neighbourhood the freshwater lake Monolcus afforded

it a good supply of water and fish. The shell of

the true laud-tortoise was found :it Plolemais: it is

described by Ajatharehides(ap,Geogr. J/t/wr.p. 40,

Hudson; Pertpl. Mar. Erutkr. p. 17) as covered

with small lozenge-»haj>ed plates, of the whiteness

of the pearl -oyster. To ancient geographers the

position of Ptolemais was of great importance, being

one of the points from which their computations

of latitude were made. Modem geographers, how­

ever, are not agreed as to the degree in which it

should he placed, some identifying it with Has-

AfftL:, opposite the island of Welh-slru, while others

(Vincent, Voyage of Xearckus, vol. ii. p. 92) pre­

fer a more southerly site, near the port of Mirza-

Mombarrik. (Comp. Mannert, vol. x. 1. p. 48,

a city of Up)*-r Aegypt, X\V. of Abydus, and situ­

ated on the western side of the Nile. It can hardly

be regarded, however, as an Aegyptian city, its

population and civil institutions being almost exclu­

sively Greek, and its importance derived entirely

from the favour of the Ptolemies. The ruins of

Ptoleinais Ilermii are supposed to he at the modern

hamlet of Mensieh. (Champollion, f Ef/gpte, vol. i.

PTOLK.MA'IS (riToAp/iais), a small town on the

coast of Pamphylia, between the river Midas and the

town of Coracesium, is mentioned only by Strabo (xiv.

p. GOT). Leake (Asia Minor, p. 197) conjectures

that Ptolernais did not stand upon the coast, as it is

not mentioned in the Stadiasmus, but occupied per-

haps the situation of the modern town of Alum,

where is a river, and upon its banks a steep hill

crowned with a Turkish castle. (Comp. Itichter,

Wallftdirten, p. .134.) [L. S.]

PUBLICA'NOS, Al). in Gallia, is placed in the

[tins, on a road which leads from Vienna ( Vienne)

on the Rhone, to the Alpis t-Jraia (f.ittle St. Ber­

nard). In following this road Ad Publicanos comes

after Mantala [Mantala], and its position is at

the commencement of the territory of the Centroncs

or La Tarentaise. Weaseling observes that the

name Ad Publicanos indicates a toll place at a

bridge. [Pons AkrahiisJ. D'Anville supposes

that Ad Publicanos was at the point where \\wt Arli,

a tributary of the here, is crossed, near which there

was an ancient Hospitiuiu or Stabulum, as it was

called, Mich as we Hnd on several Roman roads.

This place is now called UHopital de Confans, and

is near the junction of the Arli and the fahre. Ad

Publicanos was probably on the boundary of the

Aliobroges and Centrones, where some dues would

be paid. These dues or customs were established

in a period of Gallic history even anterior to the

1 Ionian conquest. (Stnib. iv. p. 190.) Gallia was

loaded with these imposts, which continued to the

time of the French Revolution of 1789. The dis­

tance between Mantala and Ad Publicanos is marked

xvi. in the [tins., which does not agree with the site

fixed by D'Anville. Oilier geographers place Ad

Publicanos at the village of l>ts Fonta'nv s. [G L.]
