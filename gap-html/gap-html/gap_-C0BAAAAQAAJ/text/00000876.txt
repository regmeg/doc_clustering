struct ion of the career would bare adapted it.

That the Lautumiae was of considerable size may

also be inferred from the circumstance that when

the consul Q. Metcllus Celcr was imprisoned there

by the tribune L. Flaviua, Metellus Attempted to

assemble the senate in it. (Dion Cass, xxxvii. 50.)

Its distinctness from the Career Mamertinus is also

.shown by Seneca (Qmtrov. 27, p. 303, Bipont).

An important alteration in the arrangement of

the forum, to which we have before ulluded, was

the removal of tlie Tribunal I'raetokis from

the comitium to the eastern end of the forum

by the tribune L. Seribonius Libo, apparently in

it.c. 149. It now stood near the Putea], a place

so called from its being open at the top like a well,

and consecrated in ancient time.> either from the

whetstone of the augur Xavius having been buried

there, or from its having been struck by lightning.

It was repaired and re-dedicated by Libo; whence it

was afterwards called IVtkai, Libonis, and Pu-

tkal Scriuonianl'M. After this period, its vicinity

to the judgment-seat rendered it a noted object at

j£i»me, and we find it frequently alluded to in the

classics. (Hor. J-'p. i. 19. 8, Sat. ii. 0. 35 ; Cic./>.

rt'TEAL LIBONIS (>K SCKIBOKIAN I'M.

Sest. 8, &e.) The tribunal of the praetor urbanus

teems, however, to have remained <>n the comitium.

lle>ides these we also find a Tribunal A u helium

lneutiimed on the forum, which seems to have stood

near the temple of Castor (Cic. Sest, 15, in

J'is. 5, fluent. 34), and which, it is conjectured,

was erected by the consul M. Aurelius Cotta B.C.

74. These tribunals were probably constructed of

wood, and in such a manner that they might be

removed on occasion, as for iiustanee, when the whole

area of the forum was required lor gladiatorial shows

or oilier purposes of the like kind; at least it appears

that the tribunals were used for the purpose of

making the tire in the curia when the body of Clo-

dius was burnt in it. (Ascon. ad Cic. Mil. Arg.

f. 34.)

Iii the year B.C. 12 1 the I EMPLE ok Concord was

built by the consul L. Opintius on the Clivus Capi-

tolinus just above the senaculum (Varr. A. L. v.

$ 1 50, Midi.); but, as we have already had occasion

to discuss the history of this temple when treating

of the Capitol and of the senaculum, we need not

revert to it here. At the same time, or a little

afterwards, he also erected the Basilica Opimia,

which is mentioned by Varro in c!o>e connection

with the temple of Concord, and must therefore

have stood on its northern side, since on no other

would there have been space for it. Of this basilira

we. hear but very little, aud it seems not improbable
