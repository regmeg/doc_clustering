1150 THEBAE BOEOTIAE. THEBAE BOEOTIAL

besieged the Macedonian garrison in the Cadmeia,

and invited the other Grecian states to declare their

independence. But the rapiditj of Alexander's

movements disconcerted all their plans. He ap­

peared at Onchestua in Boeotia, before any intel­

ligence had arrived of his quitting tlie north. He

was willing to allow the Thebans an opportunity for

repentance; but as his proposals of peace were

rejected, he directed a general assault upon the

city. The Tlieban troops outside the gates were

driven back, and tlie Macedonians entered the town

along with them. A dreadful carnage ensued;

6000 Thebans are said to have been slain, and

.'(0,000'to have been taken prisoners. Tlie doom of

the conquered city was referred to the Grecian allies

in his army, Orebomenians, Plataeans, Phocians,

and other inveterate enemies of Thebes. Their

decision must have been known beforehand. They

decreed that Thebes should be razed to the ground,

with the exception of the Cadmeia, which was to

be held by a Macedonian garrison; that the territory

of the city should be divided among the allies; and

that all the inhabitants, men, women, and children

should be sold as slaves. This sentence was carried

into execution by Alexander, who levelled the city to

the ground, with the exception of the house of Pin­

dar (Arrian, Amb. i. 8, 9; Diodor. xvii. 12—14;

.liistiii. si. 4.) Thebes was thus blotted out of the

map of Greece, and remained without inhabitants

for the next 20 years. In n.c. 315, Cassander

undertook the restoration of the city. He united

the Thcban exiles and their descendants from all

[arts of Greece, and was zealously assisted by the

Athenians and other Grecian states in the work of

restoration. The new city occupied the same.area

as the one destroyed by Alexander; and the Cad­

meia was held by a garrison of Cassander. (Diodor.

xix. 52—54, 78; Pans. ix. 7. § 4.) Thebes was

twice taken by Demetrius, first in B. C. 293, and a

second time in 290, but on each occasion he used

his victory with moderation. (Plut. Demetr. 39,

40; Diod. xxi. p. 491, ed. Wess.)

Dicaearchns, who visited Thebes not long after its

restoration by Cassander. has given a very interesting

account of the city. "Thebes," lie says (§ 12, seq.

ed. Miillcr), " is situated in the centre ol Boeotia,

and is about 70 stadia in circumference; its site is

level, its shape circular, and its appearance gloomy.

The city is ancient, but it has been lately rebuilt,

having been three times destroyed, as history relates*,

cm account of the insolence and haughtiness of its

inhabitants. It is well adapted for rearing horses

since it is plentifully provided with water, and

abounds in preen pastures and hills: it contains

also better gardens than any other city in Greece.

Two rivers flow through the town, and irrigate all

the subjacent plain. There is also a subterraneous

stream issuing from the Cadmeia, through pipes,

said to be the work of Cadmus. Thebes is a most

agreeable resilience in the summer, in consequence

of the abundance and coolness of the water, its large

gardens, its agreeable breezes, its verdant appearance,

and the quantity of .summer and autumnal fruits.

In the winter, however, it is a most disagreeable resi­

dence, from being destitute of fuel, and constantly

exposed to floods and winds. It is then often covered

with snow and very muddy." Although Dicaearchns

* Dicaearchus probably means the capture of the  
city by the Kpigoni; secondly by the Pelasgi, during

the Trojan war; and lastly by Alexander.

Thebes had its full share in the later tal arr.a? 4
