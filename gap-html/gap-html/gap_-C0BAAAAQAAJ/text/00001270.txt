dead, though in reality not in the least injured,

His antagonist then stripped off his armour, and

went out sinking the praises of Sitalces, while the

other man was carried out like a corpse by his com­

rades (cf. Ib. vii. 3. § 32, seq.; Tac. Ann. iv. 47).

Their music was rude and noisy. Strabo (x. p.

471) compares it to that of the Phrygians, whom,

indeed, he regards as descended from the Thracians.

Xcnophon, in the passage last referred to, says that

they played on horns and on trumpets made of raw

ox-hide. Their worship of Dionysus and Cotytto

was celebrated on mountain tops with loud instru­

ments of music, shouting, and noises like the bellow­

ing of cattle. (Strab. x. p. 470.)

Their barbarity and ferocity became proverbial.

Herodotus (viii. 116) tells a story of a king of the

lii-altae, who punished his six sons for disobeying

him by putting out their eyes. Seuthes, with his

own hand, transfixed some of the Thyni who had

been taken prisoners (Xen. A nab. vii, 4. § 6). Rhas-

cuporis invited his nephew to a banquet, plied him

with wine, then loaded him with fetters, and after­

wards put him to death. (Tac. Ann. ii. 64, seqq.)

Thucydides (vii. 27, seq.) gives an instance of tlie

ferocity of tlie Thracians in their massacre of the

inhabitants of Mycalessus.

A truly barbarian trait in the character of the

Thracians was their faithlessness, even to one

another. This is especially shown in their disregard

of their obligations towards the hostages whom they

pave as securities for their observance of their

engagements with others. Seuthes had received

from the Thyni a number of old men as hostages;

yet the Thyni, seeing a favourable opportunity,

as they supposed, for renewing hostilities, at once

seized it, apparently without u thought of the but

too probable consequences of such conduct to their

helpless countrymen. (Xen. Anal. vii. 4. § 21; cf.

Liv. xl. 22). Some of the tribes inhabiting the

Thracian coast of the Euxine were systematic

wreckers [Salmydessus]. Robbery, as we have

seen, was considered honourable by them; and

j.lunder was their chief inducement to engage in

war. (Strab. vii. p. 318; Cic Pis. 34; Liv. xxvi.

2"). xxxviit. 40, seq.) Strabo (iii. pp. 1G4, 105),

Mela (ii. 2), and Tacitus {Attn. iv. 51) bear

witness to tlie bravery of the Thracian women.

The deity most worshipped by the Thracians was

Dionysus, whom they, as well as the Phrygians,

called Sabazius. (Schol. Arutoph. Ye*pm 9.) The

mythical stories respecting Orpheus and Lycurgus

are closely connected with the worship of this god,

who had an oracle on Rhodope, in the country of the

Satrae, but under the direction of the Iiessi [Satrak].

Herodotus (vii. Ill) states that the mode of deliver­

ing the answers of this oracle resembled that which

prevailed ;it Delphi. lie compares also the wor­

ship of Artemis (whose Thracian name was Bendis

or Cotytto), as he had seen it celebrated by Thra­

cian and Paeonian women, with some of the ceremo­

nies at Delos (iv. 33). These resemblances may be

accounted for on the supposition that the Thracian

rites were derived from the original Pelasgian popu­

lation, remnants of which may have maintained

themselves amid the mountain histnesses; as Xiebuhr

holds (Ethnog. and Geoff, i. p. 287) was the case

with the Paeonians, who are mentioned by Herodotus

in the passage last referred to. (On the Thracian

divinities, see Strabo, x. pp. 470, 471; Sopb. Antig.

955, seq.; Piin. xvi. 62; and the articles Bkndis,

Cutvs, and Rhea, in the Diet. Ui<>g. ami Myth.)
