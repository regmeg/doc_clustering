to the S. of the modern city of Melfi, and nearly due

W. of Veitosa (Venu&ia), and attains an elevation

of 4433 feet above the level of the sea. Its regular

conical form and isolated position, a3 well as the

crater-like basin near its summit, at once mark it

as of volcanic origin; and this is confirmed by the

nature of the rocks of which it is composed. Hence

it cannot be considered as properly belonging to the

range of the Apennines, from which it is separated

by a tract of hilly country, forming as it were the

base from which the detached cone of Monte Voltore

rises. No ancient author alludes to the volcanic

character of Mount Vultur; but the mountain itself

is noticed, in a well known passage, by Horace, who

must have been very familiar with its aspect, as it

is a prominent object in the view from his native

city of Venusia. (Carm. iii. 4. 9—16.) He there

terms it "Vultur Apulus," though he adds, singu­

larly enough, that he was without the limits of

Apulia ('* altricis extra limen Apuliae") when he

was wandering in its woods. This can only be ex­

plained by the circumstance that the mountain stood

(as above stated) on the confines of three provinces.

Lucan also incidentally notices Mt. Vultur as one of

the mountains that directly fronted the plains of

Apulia. (Lucan, ix. 185.)

The physical and geological characters of Mount

Vultur are noticed by Romanelli (vol. iLp. 233), and

more fully by Daubeny (Description of Volcanoes,

chap. 11). [E. H. 13.]

VULTURNU11 (QvuvXTovpvQv. Castel Voltumo),

a town of Campania, situated on the sea-coast at the

mouth of the river of the same name, and on its S.

bank. There is no trace of the existence of any

town on the site previous to the Second Punic War,

when the Romans constructed a fortress (castellum)

at the mouth of the river with the object of securing

their possession of it, and of establishing a magazine

of corn for the use of the army that was besdeging

Capua. (Liv. xxv. 20, 22.) It is probable that

this continued to exist and gradually grew into a

town: but in it. c. 194, a colony of Roman citizens

was established there, at the same time with Inter­

num and Puteoli. (Id. xxxiv. 45; Varr. L. L. v. 5.)

The number of colonists was in each case but small,

and Vultumum does not appear to have ever risen

into a place of much importance. But it is noticed

by Livy as existing as a town in bis time (" ad Vul-

turni ostium, ubi nunc urbs est," xxv. 20), and is

mentioned by all the geographers. (Strab. v. p.

238; Plin. iii. 5. s. 9; Mel. ii. 4. § 9; Ptol. iii. 1.

§ 6.) We learn also that it received a fresh colony

under Augustus (Lib. Colon, p. 239), and retained

its colonial rank down to a late period. It became

an episcopal see before the close of the Roman Em­

pire, and appears to have continued to subsist down

to the 9th century, when it was destroyed by the

Saracens. In the 17th century a new fortress was

built nearly on the ancient site, which is called

Castel Voltumo or CastelC a Mare di Volturno.

But from the remains of the ancient city still visible

it appears that this occupied a site somewhat nearer

the sea than the modern fortress. Several inscrip­

tions have been found on the spot, which attest

the colonial rank of Vultumum as late as the age

of the Antonines. (Mummscn, /. R. N. 3535—

3539.) [E. H. B.]
