I.EGIO VII. GEMIXA.

Roman city of Astoria, in Hispania TarraeoncnsK

admirably situated at the confluence of two tribu­

taries of tlie Esla, at the foot of the Asturian moun­

tains, commanding and protecting the plain of I^-on.

As its name implies, it grew out of the station of

the new 7th legion, which was raised by the emperor

Galba in Hispania. (Dion Cass. iv. 24; Tae. Iligt.

ii. 11, iii. 25; Suet. Calba, 10.) Taritua calls the

legion G.M.niANA, to distinguish it from the old

Lkcio VII. Claudia, but this appellation is not

found on any genuine inscriptions. It appears to

have received the appellation of Gemina (respecting

the use of which, and Gf.mf.i.i.a, sec Caesar Ii. C.

iii. 3) on account of its amalgamation by Vespasian

with one of the German legions, not improbably the

Leoio I. Gekmanica. Its full name was VII.

Gemina Felix. After serving in Pannonia, and

in the civil wars, it was settled by Vespasian in

HisjAiiia Tarraconensis, to supply the place of the

VI. Victrix and X. Gemina, two of the three legions

ordinarily stationed in the province, but which had

iMfii withdrawn to Germany. (Tac. Hist. ii. 11, 67,

86. iii. 7, 10, 21—25, iv. 39; Inter, ap. Gruter,

p. 215, no. 2.) That its regular winter quarters,

under later emperors, were at lAon, we learn from

the Itinerary, Ptolemy, and the Notitia Imperii,

as well as from a few inscriptions (Muratori, p. 2037,

no. 8, A.D. 130; p. 335, nos. 2, 3, A. D. 163;

p. 336, no. 3. A. I>. 167; Gruter, p. 260, no. 1,

A. f». 216); but there are numerous inscriptions to

prove that a strong detachment of it was stationed

at Tarraco, the chief city of the province, (The

following are a selection, in order of time :— Orelli,

no. 3496, A.D. 182; no. 4815; Grater, p. 365,

no. 7.) In the inscriptions the legion has the sur­

names of P. F. AXTONINIANA, V. V. AlEXAN-

]>i:i.\na, and P. F. Skvekiasa Alexandhiana;

and its name occurs in a Greek inscription as AET.

Z. AIAiVt (C. I. vol iii. no. 4022), while another

mentions a x^aPXov i" 'IoTraWa \tytuvus i€o6fxiji.

(C. /. vol. i. no. 1126.) There is an inscription in

which is found a ''Tribunus Militum Leo. VII. Ge-

minae Felicis ik Germania," from a comparison

of which with two inscriptions found in Germany

(Lrline, Schriflen, vol. i. nos. 11, G2; Borghesi,

guile iter. Horn. iU-1 Reno, p. 26), it has been in­

ferred that the legion was employed on an expe­

dition into Germany under Alexander Severn*, and

that this circumstance gave rise to the erroneous

designation of XVp/zavurr) in the text of Ptolemy.

((Kicking, N. D. jit. ii. pp. 102G, seq.: Marquardt's

Ilrrkrr, Horn. Alterthum, vol. iii. pt. 2, p. 354;

Grotefend, in Panly's Eeaimcyliopadie, t. v.

Legio.)

The station of this legion in Asturia grew into

an important city, which relisted the attacks of the

Goths till A. n. 586, when it was taken by Leovi-

gildo; and it was one of the few cities which the

Goths allowed to retain their fortifications. During

the struggle with the Arab invaders, the same for­

tress, which the Homans had built to protect the

plain from the incursions of the mountaineers, be­

came the advanced post which covered the mountain,

as the last refuge of Spanish independence. After

yielding to the first assault of the Moors, it was

soon recovered, and was restored by Ordono I. in

850. It was again taken by Al-Mansur in 996,

after a year's siege; but was recovered after Al-

Mansurs defeat at Calatantaor, about A. D. 1000;

repeopjed by Alonao V., and enlarged by Alonso XI.,

urjder whose successor, Don Pedro, it ceased to be

the capital of the kingdom of Leon, by the removal

of the court to Strille. The greater portion of lb*

Koman walls mav still bo traced. (Ford, Ilmull»*A.

of Spain, p. 318.) [?■*>■]

LKHl, or more fully Hamatiii r.lll. a plan in

the south of Palestine, the name of which is derired

from one of Samson's exploits. (Jwlg. xv. 9, 14.17;

comp. Joseph. Ant. v. 8. § 8; Winer, Biblitch. RtaL-

ivvrUrlmeh. s. r.)

LEIMO'NE (Aetpiivn) the later name of the

Homeric EuiNE ('HAsSn)), according to Strain,

was a town of Perrhaehia in Thessaly. and «a*

situated at the foot of Mount Olympus, not far from

the Titaresins or Knrotas. The Greeks of EUunm

report that there arc some remains of this rifv a:

15. t. r. 'H\drn; Leake, Northern Greece, vol. iii.

LEINL'M (Ar/iVor), a town of Sarmatia Europtv-a,

which Ptolemy (iii. 5. § 29) places on an affluent

of the Borysthenes, but whether on the lirrr/ina. • r

some other, is uncertain. LiAxraf (Afioror, PtoL

iii. 5. § 12), on the Pains Maeotis, appears to be the

tame place repeated hv an oversight. (Schafarik,

Slar. All. vol. i. p. 512.) [E. B. J]

LEIPSYDRIUM. [Attica, p. 326, b.]

by Ptolemy (ii. 3) as lying between the actuary <(

LELAXTL'S CAMPUS (to AfjAturor west**),

a fertile plain in Euboea, between Chalcis and

L'retria, wliich was an object of frequent contention

between those, cities. [Chalcis.] It was the

subject of volcanic action. Strabo relates that on

one occasion a torrent of hot mud issued from it;

and it contained some warm springs, which were

used by the dictator Sulla. The plain was aba

celebrated for its vineyards ; and in it there were

mines of copper and iron. (Strab. i. p. 58, x. p. 44 7,

seq. ; Horn. Hymn, m A pall. 219; Theojn. e^S<;

Leake, Northern Greece, vol. ii. p. 265.) Plmy

mentions a river Lelantus in Euboea, which n.u»t

have flowed through this plain, if it rrallv existed.

(Plin. iv. 12. s. 21.)

LE'LEGES (A^Aeyet). an ancient race which

was spread over Greece, the adjoining islands, and

the Asiatic coast, before the Hellenes. They were

so widely diffused that we most either suppose that

their name was descriptive, and applied to several

different tribes, or that it was the name of a uncle

tribe and was Hfterwanis extended to others. Straho

(vii. p. 322) regarded them as a mixed race, and «ai

disposed to believe that their name had reference to

this (to o-uAA«'ktoi>s ytyoifinuy. They niay pro­

bably bo looked upon, like the Pehu^iana and the

other early inhabitants of Greece, as members of

the great Indo-Europoan race, who became gra­

dually incorporated with the Hellenes, and that

ceased to exist as an independent people.

The most distinct statement of ancient writers tw

the origin of the Leleges is that of HerorWus, who

says that the name of Iv leges was the ancient nan*

of the Carions (Herod, i. 171). A later Gmk

i writer considered the Lclcirca as stambug in the

same relation to the Carions as the lleko to the

Lacedaemonians and the Penestae to the Tbesamhana.

| (Allien, vi. p. 271.) In Homer both Lelrgea and

Carians appear as equals, and as auxiliaries of the

Trojan*. (IL x. 428.) The Leleges are ruled by

Altcs, the father-in-law of Priam, and inhabit a
