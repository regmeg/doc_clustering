D'Anville (A'oiic*, <fc) ingeniously supposes that

Onobrisates ought to be Onobusntes, which is the

least possible correction; and he thinks that he dis­

covers the old name in the modern Ntbousan, the

name of a canton on the left side of the Neste to­

wards the lower part of its course. The Neste is

one of the branches of the Garonne, and rises in

the Pyrenees. [G. L.l

ONUGNATHUS fOrou yviSos), " the jaw of an

ass," the name of a peninsula and promontory in the

south of Lnconia, distant 200 stadia south of Aso-

pus. It is now entirely surrounded with water, and

is called Elafonisi; but it is in reality a peninsula,

for the isthmus, by which it is connected with the

mainland, is only barely covered with water. It

contains a harbour, which Strabo mentions; and

Pausanias saw a temple of Athena in ruins, and the

sepulchre of Cinadus, the steersman of Menelaus.

(Paus. iii. 22. § 10, iii. 23. § 1; Strab. viii. pp. 363,

364; Curtius, Peloponnesus, vol. ii. p. 295.)

ONU'PHIS ("Oouoiij, Herod, ii. 166; Steph. B.

*. r.; Ptol. iv. 5. § 51 ; Plin. V. 9. s. 9: Eth. 'Ovou-  
9>1ti)s), was the chief town of the Nomos Onu-

phites, in the Aegyptian Delta. The exact position

of this place is disputed by geographers. D'Anville

believes it to have been on the site of the modem

Banoub, on the western hank of the Sebennytic arm

of the Nile. Maunert (vol. x. pt. i, p. 573) places

it south of the modern Mansour. lielley {Mem. de

VAcad. des Inscript. torn, xxviii. p. 543) identifies

it with the present village of Nouph, in the centre

of the Delta, a little to the E. of Buto, about lat.

31° X. Champollion, however, regards the site of

this nome as altogether uncertain (TEgypte sons Its

Pharaohs, vol. ii. p. 227). The Onuphite nome was

one of those assigned to the Calasirian division of

the native Aegyptian army. Coins of Onuphis of

the age of Hadrian — obverse a laureated huad of

that emperor, reverse a female figure, probably

Isis, with extended right hand — are described in

Kasche {Lex. It. Num. III. pars posterior, s.v.~).

This town is mentioned by ecclesiastical writers,

e.g. by Athanasius. (Athanas. Opera, torn. i. pt. ii.

p. 776, ed. Paris, 1698; Le Quien, Orient Chris­

tian, torn. ii. p. 526, Paris, 1740; com p. Pococke,

OONAE. [Oaeonks.]

OPHARUS, a small river of Sarmatia Asiatica,

mentioned by Pliny (vi. 7. s. 7) as a tributary of

the Lagous, which flowed into the Pains Maeotis.

Herodotus mentions two streams, which he calls the

LycUS and Oarus, which had the same course and

direction (iv. 123, 124). It is likely that the

rivers in Pliny and Herodotus are the same. It is

not possible now to identify them with accu­

racy. [V.]

in Foul Bay, nearly opposite the mouth of the har­

bour of Berenice; lat 24° N. The topazes pro­

duced in this island were greatly prized both in the

Arabian and Aegyptian markets; and it seems from

Pliny (v. 29. ». 34) to have been by some deno­

minated Topaz-isle (Topazos). The cause of its

more usual name is doubtful; but there has always

been a tradition in the East that serpents and pre­

cious stones arc found near one another. The
