not present at Sal amis, us they had to leave the

fleet in order to remove their families and property

from the city, in consequence of tbe approach ot'the

Persian army. (Herod, viii. 44.) Upon the arrival

of the Persians shortly afterwards their city was

burnt to the ground. (Herod, viii. 50.) In the fol­

lowing year (b. c. 470) their territory was the scene

of the memorable battle, which delivered Greece

from the Persian invaders. The history of this battle

illustrated so completely the topography of the Pla-

taean territory, that it is necessary to give an account

of the different positions taken by the contending forces

(Sec accompanying -Map). Mardonius proceeded from

Attica into Boeotia across Mount l'anies by the pass

ofDeceleia, and took up a position on the bank of the

Asopus. where he caused a fortified camp to be con­

structed of 10 stadia square. The situation was

well selected, since lie bad the friendly city of Thebes

in his rear, ami was thus in DO danger of falling

short of provisions. (Herod, ix. 15.) The Grecian

army crossed over from Attica by Mt. Cithaeron;

but as Pansanias did not choose to expose bis troops

to tbe attacks of the Persian cavalry on the plain,

he stationed them on the slopes of the mountain,

near Krytbrae, where the ground was rugged and

uneven. (See Map, First Position.) This position

did not. however, altogether preserve them; but, in

an attack made by the Persian cavalry, a laxly of
