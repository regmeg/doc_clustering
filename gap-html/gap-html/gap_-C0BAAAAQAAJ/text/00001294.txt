TIMACHUS, a river in Upper Moesia, a tributary

TIMACUM MAJUS and MINUS (Tlncxov,

Ptol. iii. 9. § 5), two towns of Moesia Superior si­

tuated on the Timachus. (Geo^r. Bav. iv. 7; Tab.

Peut.) One still exists by the name of Timok; but

Mamiert .seeks the larger town near Iptrik, and the

smaller one near Geurgotcatz. [T. H. D.]

TIMALINUM, a place in Gallaecia in Hispania

Tarraconensis (/tin. Ant. pp. 425. 430). Variously

identified with Villartelin&ud Fontancira, [T. H.D.J

TIMA'VUS (Tlpavos: Timao), a river of Venetia,

flowing into the Adriatic sea between Aquileia and

Tergeste, about 12 miles E. of the fonner city.

Notwithstanding its classical celebrity, it is one of

the shortest of rivers, being formed by copious

sources which burst out from the rock at the foot of

a lofty clitF, and immediately constitute a broad and

deep river, which has a course of littlo more than a

mile before it discharges itself into the sea. There

can be no doubt that these sources are the outlets of

some subterranean stream, and that the account of

l'osidonius (op. Strab. v. p. 215), who says that the

river after a course of some length falls iuto a

chasm, and is carried under ground about 130

stadia before it issues out again and falls into the

sea, is substantially correct. Such subterranean

passages arc indeed not uncommon in Camiola, and

it is impossible to determine from what particular

river or lake the waters of the Timavus derive their

origin; but the popular notion still regards them as

the outflow of a stream which sinks into the earth

near S. Canz'mn, about 13 miles from the place of

their reappearance. (Cluver. ItaL p. 193.) The

number of the sources is variously stated: Virgil,

in the well-known passage in which he describes

them (Aen. i. 245), reckons them nine in number,

and this agrees with the statement of Mela; while

Strabo speaks of seven; anil this would appear from

Servius to have been the common belief (Serf,ad Am,

I. c.; Mel. ii. 4. § 3), which is supported also by Mar­

tial, while Claudian follows Virgil (Mart. iv. 25. G;

Claudian, de VI. Cons. Hon. 198). Cluverius, on

the other hand, could find but six, and some modern

travellers make them only four. Strabo adds that,

according to Poly M us, all but one of them were salt,

a circumstance which would imply some connection

with the sea, and, according to Cluverius, who

described them from personal observation, this was

distinctly the case in his time; for though at low-

water the stream issued tranquilly from its rocky

sources, and flowed with a still and placid current

to the sea, yet at high tides the waters were swollen,

so as to rush forth with much greater force and

volume, and inundate the neighbouring meadows:

and at such times, he adds, the waters of all the

sources but one become perceptibly brackish, doubt­

less from some subterranean communication with

the sea. (Cluver. ItaL p. 194.) It appears from

this account that Virgil's remarkable expressions—

"Unde per ora novem, vasto cum murmure inontis

It mart proruptum, ct pelago premit arva sonauti"

—are not mere rhetorical exaggerations, but have a

foundation in fact. It was doubtless from a refer­

ence to the same circumstance that, according to

Polybius (ap. Strab. L c), the tfms

by the natives " the source and motfjtr rf It t*'
