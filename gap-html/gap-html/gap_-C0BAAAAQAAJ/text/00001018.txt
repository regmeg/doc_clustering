930 SCHEDIA. SCIDRUS.

a district, Corybissa, near Scepsis, of which other­

wise nothing is known. Extensive ruins of Scepsis

are believed to exist on an eminence near the village

of E&kiupshi. These ruins are about 3 miles in

circumference, ami 8 gates can be traced in its walls.

SOHE'WA (2x*8fa, Strah. xvii. pp. 800,8u3),a

large town-like village of Lower Egypt, situated on

the great canal which connected Alexandria with the

Canopic arm of the Nile, near Audropolis. At

Schedia was the general custom-house for goods,

ascending or descending the river, and also the

•tation for the splendid vessels in which the prefects

visited tiie upper country; whence it is singular

that it ifl nut mentioned by any later writer than

Strabo. Mannert (x. pt i. p. 601) seeks it on the

lake of Aboukir; whilst Reichardt, from the simi­

larity of the name, takes it to have been the modem

tisjedie. [T. H. D-]

SCHE'RIA. [CoBCTIU.]

SCHINUSSA, a small island in the Aegaean sea,

one of the Spondee, & of Num. (PUo.it. 12. s.68.)

SCH1STE (h axi(TTh ^8oi), the name of the road

leading from Delphi into Centre] Greece, was more

particularly applied to the spot where the road di­

vided into two, and which wu called rpus nt\tu8ot,

reckoning the road to Delphi as one of the three.

Of the other two roads, the XE. led to Paul is; the

SE. parted into two, one leading to Tfichii and

Leba«Jeia, the other to Ambrysus and Stiris. At

the spot where the three roads met was the tomb of

Lai us and his servant, who were here slain by

Oedipus. It must have tt «»i at the entrance of

the Zimenfi Dervi'ni, or opening between the moun­

tains Cirphis and 1'amassus, which leads to Delphi.

The road from this point becomes very steep and

rugged towards Delphi, as Pausanias has described

it. (Aeshyl. Oett. Tyr. 733; Eurip. Phocn. 38;

I'aus. ix. 2. § 4, x. 5. § 3; Leake, Northern 6'recce,

vol. ii. p. 105.)

SCHOENUS {Xxot^ovs), the name of several

town-, from the reeds or rushes growing in their

™*igliUiurhi>od. 1. (usually 5x<"*,'«*)» » *°wn i"

Boeotin, mentioned by Homer (//. ii. 497). and

placed by Stabo upon a river of the same name in

thy territory of Thelx's, upon the road to Anthedon,

and at the distance of 50 stadia from Thebes.

(Strab. ix. p. 408; Euatath. ad loC\ Steph. It. #. p.;

Niiantler, Thtriuc. 887; PUn. iv. 7. s. 12.) This

river is probably the stream Howii.g into the lake

of Hylic* from the valley of Mor'tki, and which

near its mouth is covered with rushes. Xicander

is clearly wrung, who makes (/. c.) the Schoenus

flow into the lake Copais. (Ulrichs. Heisen, p. 258;

Leake, Northern Greece, vol. ii. p. 320.) Schoeuus

was the birthplace of the celebrated Atalanta, the

daughter of Schoenus (I'aus. viii. 35. § 10); and

hence Statins gives to Schoenus the epithet of

"AtalanUeus." (Stat. Thtb. vii. 267.)

2. A town iu the centre of Arcadia near Me-

thvdrium, which was said to have derived its name

from the Boeotian Schoenus. (Paus. viii. 35. § 10;

Steph. B. $. r.; Leake, J'doponnesuiat, p. 240.)

3. A harbour iu the Coiinthia. [CoRUrTHUa,

p. G83. a.]

4. A river near Maroneia in Thrace, mentioned

only by Mela (ii. 2. § 8).

SCHOENUS, a bay on the west coast of Cam,

on the south-east of the Cnidiau Chersotifsus, and

opposite the island of Symc. (Pomp. Mela, i. 16;

Plin. v. 29.) It should he observed, homr, tnl

this description of the bey of Schoeow U oafr em-

jectural, and based upon the order in wtah Yjsj

mentions the places in that localitr. [L &.]

SCIA (Sf»o: Eth. 2km**), a small town le t..-

boea (Steph. B. «. r. 2*idi), probablv is tb* tmv

tions Scium as a district belr-ngine to Ervtra.
