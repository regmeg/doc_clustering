E wut (sanded, or at least settled and enlarged,

he constructed the Aemi-

lian Way ; and this is confirmed by a passage of

Feat us, from which it appears that it was originally

called Forum Lepidi. (Feat. J.r. Rhegium, p. 270.)

The origin of the appellation of Regium, which com­

pletely superseded the former name, is unknown. It

did not become a colony like the neighbouring cities

of Mutina and Parma, and evidently never rose to

the same degree of opulence and prosperity as those

cities, but became, nevertheless, a flourishing muni­

cipal town. It is repeatedly mentioned during the

civil war with M. Antonius, both before And after

the battle of Mutina (Cic. ad Fam. xi. 9, xii. 5);

and at a somewhat earlier period it was there that

M. Brutus, the father of the murderer of Caesar, was

put to death by Pompey in B.C. 79. (Oros. v. 22;

Plut. Pomp. 16.) Its name scarcely occurs in his­

tory during the Roman Empire; but its municipal

consideration is attested by inscriptions, and it is

mentioned by all the geographers among the towns

on the Via Aemilia, though ranked by Strabo with

those of the second class. (Strab. v. p. 216; Plin.

iii. 15. s. 20; Ptol. iii. 1. § 46; Orell. Imcr. 3983,

4133; Tac. Hist. ii. 50; Phlegon. Macrob. 1.)

Ptolemy alone gives it the title of a Colonia, which is

probably a mistake ; it was certainly not such in

the time of Pliny, nor is it so designated in any

extant inscription. Zumpt, however, supposes that

it may have received a colony under Trajan or

Hadrian. (Zumpt, de Colon, p. 403.) St. Ambrose

notices Regium as well as Placentia and Mutina

among the cities which bad fallen into great decay

before the close of the fourth century. (Ambros.

Ep. 39.) It was not long before this that an attempt

had l>een made by the emperor Gratian to repair tlie

desolation of this part of Italy by settling a body of

Gothic captives in the territory of Regium, Parma,

and the neighbouring cities. (Ammian. xxxi. 9.

§ 4.) The continued existence of Regium at a late

period is proved by the Itineraries and Tabula (/tin.

Ant. pp.283, 287; Itin. Hier. p. 616; Tab. Prut.),

and it is mentioned lung after the fall of the Western

Empire by Paulus Diaconus among the " locupletes

urbes" of Aemilia. (P. Diac. Hist, lsong. ii. 18.)

In the middle ages it rose to a great degree of pro-

speriiy, and Reggio is still a considerable town with

about 16000 inhabitants. Its episcopal see dates

from the fifth century.

The tract called the Campi Macri, celebrated for

the excellence of its wool, was apparently included in

the territory of Regium Lepidum. [E. H. B.]

REGNI ('Prryyoi, Ptol. ii. 3. § 28), a people on

with Ringicood in Hampshire. Horsley, on the con­

trary (p. 441), conjectures it to have been Chi­

found at Chichester, its situation docs not suit the

distances given in the Itinerary. [T. H. 1).]
