bunwra, Larache, and Tangier, but perhaps most

*r*lly with the first. [T. H. D.]

THYNI (Plin. iv. 11. s. 18, v. 32. s. 43 ; Swot,

m<i. L 28), a people in the SE. part of Thrace,

c«f«n the Agrianesand the mountains which scpa-

t« its bead-waters from the Euxine. At a very

rly ptriud, a portion of the tribe, along with the

U'.ni race of the Bithyni, emigrated to Asia Minor,

ithynia; but part of which seems originally to

it been named more directly from the Thyni,

>X Respecting the Asiatic Thyni, see also Strabo,

i f. 295. xii. p. 541; and the article Ritiiynia.

Of toe Thyni who remained in Europe scarcely

y sotioB is taken by the ancient historians. When

■soplion and the remnant of the 10.000 Greeks

>r>J the service of Seuthes, one expedition in

bch tbey were employed had for its object the

I'.urxtion of the Thyni, who were said to have

'i:«l Teres, an ancesUtr of Seuthes (Anab. Tii.

5 22 X Xenophon gives them the somewhat

uvocal character of being the most warlike of all

;k especially by night: and be had personal

t*rance of their fondness for nocturnal fighting;

. baring encamped in their villages at the foot of

■ mountains, to which the Thyni had retired on

'approach of Seuthes and his forces, he was

sck«d by them on the next night, and narrowly

if*] being burnt to death in the house in which

had taken up his quarters (/ft. 4. § 14, seq.).

'. this attack having failed, the Thyni again fled

the moan tains, and soou afterwards submitted to

.thes. Xniophon visited the country of the Thyni

ii* winter (/&. 6. § 31), which he describes as

extremely severe, there being deep snow on the

and, sod so low a temperature, that not only

;«•, but even wine in the vessels was frozen; and

it of the Greeks lost noses and ears through

*oit*. (/». 4. § 3.) [J. R.]

rUY'XIAS (0vrtat), a small island in the Eux-

at a distance of one mile from the coast of Thy-

or Bithyuia; its distance from the port of Rhob'

> SO stadia, and from Calpe 40. (Plin. vi. 13;

■iao, Peripl. P. E. p. 13) The island had only

tuv-a in circumference, and had at first been

sd Apolkmia from a temple of Apollo which ex-

d in it- (Plin., Arrian, IL cc.; Apollon. Rhod.

177, 675; Anon. Peripl. P. E. p. 3.) Accord-

to Ptolemy (v. 1. § 15) it was also called Da­

tura, and obtained its name of Thynias from the

rai, who inhabited the opposite coast. The island

a port and a naval station belonging to Hera-

• (Nrylax, p. 34; Arrian, i c); and Mela (it 7)

is probably mistaken in believing that the island

contained a town of the same name. (Comp. Strab.

xii. p. 543, where it is called Thynia; Marxian, p.

69; Stcph. B. e. v.; Orph. Argon. 717, where it

bears the name Thyneis.) The modern name of the

island is Kirpek. [L. S.]

THY'NIAS (Mela ii. 2. § 5; Plin. iv. 11. a. 18;

8w(ar, Strabo vii. p. 319, xii. p. 541: Scymn.

727; Arrian. Per. P. Eux. p. 24; Anon. Per. P.

Eux.f. 15; PtoLiii. 11.§ 4; Steph. B.«. tt.), a pro­

montory on the Thracian coast of the Euxine, N.

of Salmydessus, which was probably at one time in

the territories of the Thyni, although Strabo (vii. p.

319) speaks of the district as belonging to the peo­

ple of Apollonia. Pliny (/. c.) mentions a town of

the same name, which in some maps is placed a

little to the south of the promontory, on the site of

the modem Jnada or Imada; but which, according

to Dapper {de VArchip. p. 515), is still called

Thinno. [J. R.]

THYNOS or TYNOS, a town mentioned only by

Pliny (v. 22) as situated between Mopsus and Ze-

phyrium in Cilicia. [L. S.]

THYRAEUM (eir/roTor: /.'//,. eupou»X a town of

Arcadia in the district Cynuria, said to have been

founded by Thyraeus, a son of Lycaon, It is placed

by Leake at Palamari. (Pans. viii. 3. § 3, 35. §

THYR1DES (©noloej), a promontory of Laconia,

on the western coast of the Taygetic peninsula, now

called Cape Orotso. It is of a semicircular form,

nearly 7 miles in circumference, and rises from the

sea to the height of 700 feet. There are many

apertures and clefts in the rocks, the abodes of in­

numerable pigeons, and from the window-like form

of these holes the whole promontory has received ths

name of Thyrides. Strabo describes it as a Aow&nt

*(rr|^»ftj, "a precipitous cape beaten by the winds,"  
distant 130 stadia from Taenarum (reckoning from

the northern point of Thyrides) ; Pauaanias, as a

promontory (axpa), situated 70 stadia from Taena­

rum (reckoning from the southern point of the pro­

montory X Pauaanias likewise calls it a promontory

of Taenarum, using the latter word in its widest

sense, to signify the whole peninsula of Mant Ac­

cording to Strabo, the Messenian gulf terminated at

this promontory. Pliny (iv. 12. a 56) mentions

three islands of the name of Thyrides in the Asinaean

gulf. (Pans. iii. 25. § 9; Strab. viii. pp. 360, 362;

Leake, Morea, vol. i. p. 302, seq.; Boblaye, He-

chercket, <*c. p. 91; Curtius, Pttopoimttot, vol. ii.

p. 281.)

THYRIUM, or THY'REUM (eiptw, Pol. iv. 25;

Sv/xov, Pol. iv. 6; Sovptov, Pol. xxviii. 5; Qvpfrtw*,

Anth. Grace, ix. 553: EtA. Qvptivs, Thyriensis), a city

in Acamania, the exact site of which is nnknown. It

placed by Pouqueville in the interior near the sources

of the Anapus; and his authority is followed by K. O.

Miiller and others. This, however, is evidently a

mistake. Cicero tells us (ml Fan. xvi. 5) that in

sailing from Alyzia to Leucas, he touched at Tby-

rium, where he remained two hours; and from this

statement, as well as from the history of the events

in which Thyrium is mentioned, wo may infer that

it was situated on or near the Ionian sea, and that

it was the first town on the coast S. of the canal
