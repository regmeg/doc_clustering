of the Crusades, Joppa, which had already taken

the name of Jaffa ('\a*pu, Anna Comn. Alex. xi.

p. 328), was alternately in the hands of the Chris­

tians ami Moslems. After its capture by Snladin

(Wilken, Die Kretaz, vol. iv. pp. 537,539) it fell

into the hands of onr own Richard (p. 545), was

then sacked by Malek-al-Adcl (vol, v. p. 25). was

rebuilt by Frederick II. (vol. vi. p. 471) and

Locis IX. (vol. vii. p. 316), when it was taken by

Sultan Bibars (vol. vii. p. 517). As the landing-

place for pilgrims to Jeru-alem, from the first Cru-

tade to onr own day, it occurs in all the Itineraries

and books of travels, which describe the locality and

natural unfitness of Jaffa for a haven, in terms very

rimilar to those employed by the ancients. For coins

rf Joppa see Eckhet, vol. iii. p. 433. (Roland, Pa-

JORDANES. [Palaestina.]

IOS ("los: Eth. 'Ittttji, 'I«T7|t), an island in the

Aegaean sea, one of the Sporados, and falsely called by

Stephanus one of the Cyclades, lay north of Thera

and south of Paros and Naxos. According to Pliny,

it was 25 miles in length, and was distant 18 miles

from Naxos and 25 from Thera. (Plin. iv. 12. s. 23.)

Both Pliny and Stephanus state that it was ori­

ginally called Phoenice. It possessed a town of the

same name (Ptol. iii. 15. § 28), situated upon a

height on the western side of the island. It has an

exce lent harbour, of a circular form, like the Pei-

raeeus: its mouth faces the south-west, and is op.

pnMte the island of Sicinus. The island is now

railed Sio (iv "Iy); and when Ross visited it, in

1836, it contained 505 families or 2500 souls. The

modern town is built upon the site of the ancient

one, of which there are still remains.

los was celebrated in antiquity as the burial-

place of Homer, who is said to have died here on his

vovage from Smyrna to Athens. Long afterwards,

when the fame of the poet had filled the world, the

inhabitants of los are reported to have erected the

following inscription upon his tomb

'Zi&a&* t$iv itphv Kctpa\i]v Kara ycua Ka\virrci

'Arip£/t ripwvy Koff^ropa, Stlov 'Opnpcv.

(Pseudo-Herod. Fit Vomer. 34, 36; comp. Seylax,

p. 22; Slrab. x. p. 484; Paus. x. 24. § 2; Plin.,

Meph. U. cc.) It was also stated that Clymene,

the mother of Homer, was a native of los, and that

she was buried iu the island (Paus., Steph. B., U.cc);

and, according to Gellius (iii. 11), Aristotle related

that Homer himself was bom in los. In 1771 a

Dutch nobleman, Graf Pasch van Krienen, asserted

that be had discovered the tomb of Homer in the

n-.Tthem part of the island; and in 1773 he pub­

lished an account of his discovery, with some in­

scriptions relating to Homer which ho said he had

found upon the tomb. Of this discovery a detailed

COIN OF IOS.

account is given by Ross, who is disposed to believe

the account of Pasch van Krienen; but the original

inscriptions have never been produced, and most

modern scholars regard them as forgeries. (Ross,

Jieisen auf den Griech. Jnseln, vol. i. pp. 54, 154,

seq.; Welcker, in Zeitschrift fur die Alterthum-

sicissenschaft, 1844, p. 290, seq.)

JOTABE ('ItoTaS7)), an island in the Erythraean

Sea, not less than 1000 stadia from the city of

Aelana, inhabited by Jews who, formerly inde­

pendent, accepted the yoke of the Empire during

the reign of Justinian (Procop. B. P. i. 19). It is

now called Tiran, or Djeziret Tyran of Burkhardt

(Trav. p. 531), the island at the entrance of the

Gulfof Ahibah. (Comp. Journ. of Geog. Soc. vol.

vi. pp. 54, 55.) The modern name recalls the

"Gens Tyra" of Pliny (vi. 33), placed by him in

the interior of the Arabian gulf. (Ritter, Erd-

hmde, vol. xiii. pp. 223—225, vol. xiv. pp. 19,

262.) [E. B. J.]

JOTA'PATA (WdWa: Eth. 'IairajraTiji'o's,

Steph. B. *. r.), a city of Galilee, standing on the

summit of a lofty hill, rising abruptly on three sides,

from the deep and impassable ravines which sur­

rounded it. Josephus, who manfully defended it

against Vespasian, has told the story of its siege and

capture : 1200 prisoners were taken, and 40,000 men

fell by the sword during its protracted siege: Ves­

pasian gave orders that the city should be razid

to the ground, and all the defences burnt. Thus

perished Jotnpata on the first day of Panemus

(July) (B.J. iii. pp. 6—8; comp. Reland, Palnest.

p. 867; Milman, Hist, of Jews, vol. ii. pp.287—

309). Mr. Bankcs (lrby and Mangles, Trav.

p. 299) has fixed the site at the singular remains of

KiiTat Ilm Mu'an, in the Wady-el-Ham&m (comp.

Burkhardt, Trae. p. 331; Ritter, Erdhmde, vol.

xv. pt i. p. 327), but Robinson (Researches, vol. iii.

pp. 279—282) identifies these ruins with the Ar-

bela of Galilee and its fortified caverns. [E. B. J.]

JO'TAPE (Torrdirj): Eth. 'UiTBTelrns), a small

town of Cilicia, in the district called Selenitis, not

far from Selinus. It is perhaps the same place as

Laertc, the native city of Diogenes Laertius. It is

identified with the modern fort iMmbardo. (Ptol. v.

8. § 2; Plin.v. 22-, Concil. Chalced. p. 659; Hierocl.

p. 709, where it is called 'lordmt; comp. Laf.rtk.)

The coins of Iotape belong to the emperors Philip

and Valerian. [L. S-]

JOVA'LIA, a town of Lower Pannonia, on the

southern bank of the river Dravus. (Itin. Uieros.

p. 562.) In the Peut. Tab. it is called Iovallium,

while Ptolemy (ii. 16. § 6.) calls it 'loioWov or

'IooSoAoy, and the Geog. Rav. (iv. 19), Ioballios. It

occupied, in all probability, the site of the modern

village of Valpo. [L. S.]

JQVEM, AD, in Gallia Aquitania, a Mutatio on

the road from Burdigala (Bordeaux) to Tolosa

(Toulouse'); and between Bucconis andTolo*a. This

Mutatio was seven leagues from Tolosa. D'Anville

conjectures it to be at a place which he names

Guevin or Guerin. Wnlckenaer fixes the Mutatio

of Bucconis near the Bois du Bouconne. [G. I..]

JOTIA, a town in Lower Pannonia, south of the

river Dravus, on the road from Poetovium to Mursa.

(Itin. Uieros. p. 561; Itin. Ant. p. 130; Tab. Peut.)

The site is generally identified with some ruins found

at Toplita. Another place of the same name ia

mentioned in Upper Pannonia, on the same road

(Itin. .4nf. p.264), and is identified with some ruins

found at Iovinax. [L. S.]
