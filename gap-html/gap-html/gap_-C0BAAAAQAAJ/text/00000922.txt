Topoyr. p. 140, and Atttw. p. 32). Indeed Eu-

menius cxpre-sly says that Fulviua Nobilior when

in Greece had heard "Herculem Musagetem esse

comitein ducemque Musarum" (pro Inst. Schol.

Avg. p. 195, Amtz.); and we learn from Ovid that

the statue of Hercules represented him with a

lyre (Fast. vi. 810) : —

"Annuit Alcidcs, increpuitque lyram."

The vicinity of the temple and portico is indicated

in Martial (v. 49. 8).

It is supposed that the Theatrum Baldi lay

close to the western side of this portico, and, a little

farther on, opposite the round end oi* the circus, but

rather to the north of it, the Theatrum Pompeii;

of which latter there are still some remains at the

Palazzo Pio. Pompey's theatre must have lain

close to the boundary between the Campus Martins

and Circus Flaminius since Pliny mentions that a

colossal statue of Jupiter, erected by the emperor

Claudius in the Campus, was called Pompeianus

from its vicinity to the theatre (*'Talis in Campo

Martiu Jupiter a Divo Claudio Caesare dicatus, qui

vocatur Pompeianus a viemitate theatri," xxxiv.

18). The same tiling might also be inferred from

Cicero ('' Quid enim loci natura afferre potest, ut in

porticu Pompeii potiusquam in Campo ambulemus,"

de Fato, 4.) Hence it would appear that the

boundary of the two districts, after proceeding

along the northern side of the Circus Flaminius,

took a north-westerly direction towards the river.

The Poirncrs Pompeii adjoined the scena of his

theatre, and afforded a shelter to the spectators in

the event of bad weather. (Vitruv. v. 9.) But

what conferred the greatest interest on this group of

buildings was the Curia Pompeii, a large hall or

hexedra in the portico itself, sometimes used for the

representation of plays as well as for assemblies of

the senate. It was here that Caesar was assas­

sinated, at the base of Pompey's statue; an event

which caused it to be regarded as a locus sceleratus,

ami to he walled up in consequence. (Cic. Div. ii.

9; Dion Cass. xliv. 16. 52: Suet. Cues. 80,88;

Pint. Brut. 14, Cats. 66, &c.) The statue of

Pompey, however, was first taken out by order of

Augustus, and placed under a marble arch or

Janus, opposite the portico. (Suet. Awj. 31.) It

is a question whether the portico styled Hecato-

stylon, from its having a hundred columns, was

only another name for the portico of Pompey, or

quite a distinct building. It is sometimes men­

tioned in a manner which would seem to intimate

that it was identical with the Porticus Pompeii.

Tims both ate said to have had groves of plane-

trees (Prop. ii. 32. 11), and to have been consumed

in one and the same fire. (Hieron. Chron. p. 475,

Hone.) The following lines of Martial, however,

appear to show that they were separate, but adjoin­

ing buildings (ii. 14. 6); —

"Indc petit centum pendentia tccta columnis;

Illinc Pompeii dona neinusque duplex"

From these lines, and from two fragments of the

I'apitoline Plan, Canina has correctly inferred that

there were two distinct porticoes, and that the

Heeatostylon adjoined the X. side of that of Pompey.

(Indie, p. 373.) Pompey also built a private dwell­

ing-house near his theatre, in addition to the house

which he possessed in the Carinae. The former of

these seems to have been situated in some gardens.
