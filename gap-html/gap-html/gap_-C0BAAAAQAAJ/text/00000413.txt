NACONA. SO.", NAISSUS.

Arradiux, Nacoleia was occupied by a Gothic gar­

rison, which revolted against the emperor. (Phi-

lostarg. xL 8; comp. Hierocl p. 678 ; Cone. Chai­

red, p. 578.) The I'euting. Table places it 20

tuiln south of Dorylaeum, and Col. Leake {Asia

Minor, p. 24) is inclined to identify the place with

Pitman Kalesi, near Doganlu, where he saw some

Tcry remarkable, apparently sepulchral, monuments.

But the monument* alluded to by Leake seem to

have belonged to a more important place than Na-

eoleta, and Texier (Descript. <U VAtie Mia. vol. i.)

asserts that it is proved by coins that Nacoleia was

situated on the site of the modern Suiigluwi, on the

north-west of Itoyanla. [L. S.l

NACONA (NaKwrri, Steph. B.: Eth. Na««.

n»i), a town of Sicily mentioned only by Stephanus

of Byzantium, who cites Philistns as his authority.

The accuracy of the name is, however, confirmed by

ciina, the earliest of which bear the legend NAKO-

NAION, while those of later date have NAKfl-

NAIQN. From one of the latter we learn that the

town had been occupied by the Campanians, appa­

rently at the same period with Aetna and Entella.

(Millingen, Ancient Coins, pp. 33—35; Sestini,

Lett. Sun. voL vii. pi. 1.) There is no clue to its

position. [E. 11. B.]

NA'CKASA (NcUpeura), a town in the north of

Lydia, on the road from Thyatira to Pergamum.

(Ptol. t. 2. § 16; Hierocl. p. 670, where it is called

"AKpcvrot.) Chishull (Ant. A/iat. p. 146) has

identified the place by means of coins with Bakhir,

or Bahri, somewhat to the north-east of Somma.

NAELUS (NoTaot, Ptol. ii. 6. § 5), n river on

the north coast of Hispania Tarraconensis, in the ter­

ritory of the Paesici, a tribe of the Astures. Now

the Salon.

XAGADIBA (NcrydSisV, Ptol. vii. 4. § 7: Eth.

WryiXtgtx, Ptol. vii. 4. § 9), a town in the HE.

cwnrr of the island of Taprobane or Ceylon, at no

frreat distance from the capital Anurogrammum.

Ptolemy pives the same name to one of a group of

islands which, he states, surrounded Ceylon, (vii. 4.

§ 13). The name may be a corruption of the

Sanscrit Sagailieijm, which would mean Island of

Snakes. [V.]

NAGABA (Ntryopa), a city in the NW. part of

India intra Gangem, distinguished in Ptolemy by

the title 77 icni £novvu6wo\is (vii. 1. § 43). It

■ no doubt the present Nagar, between the Kabul

river and the Indus. From the second name which

Ptolemy has preserved, we are led to believe that

this U the same place as Nysa or Nyssa, which was

spared from plunder and destruction by Alexander

became the inhabitants asserted that it had been

founded by Bacchus or Dionysus, when he conquered

the Indians. (Arrian, Anab. v. 1; Curt. viii. 10.

$ 7.) A mountain called Meron was said to over­

hang the city, which was also connected with the

legend of Bacchus having been reared in the thigh

of Zeus. [V.]

NAGARA. [Mabsyabak.]

NAGEIRI (tidytipoi or Naviyetpot, Ptol. vii. 4.

§9), one of the two most southern tribes of Tapro­

bane (Ceylon). They appear to have lived in the

immediate neighbourhood of what Ptolemy calls, and

what are still, " the Elephant Pastures," and to have

had a town called tlie city of Dionysus (biovvaov

ToAir or &Kpov~), which is probably represented now

by the ruins of Kattregam (Davy, Account of Cey­

lon, p. 420; Hitter, Erdkunde, vi. p. 22); if these

are not, as some have supposed, the remains of Mor-

dulamne. [V.]

NA'GIDUS (NcryiSos: Eth. NayiStvs),* town of

Cilicia on the coast, said to luivo been colonised by

the Samians. Stephanus B. mentions an island

named Nagidusa, which corresponds to a little rock

about 200 feet long, close to the castle of A ntunour.

Staph. B. s. v.; Beaufort, Kammunia, p. 206; Cra­

NAGNA'TA (Ndywra, Ptol. ii. 2. § 4, in the old

editt. Md7»aTa), an important town (ttoAis M-

o-nnos) on the west coast of Ireland, in the territory

of the Nagxatak (Nayvarcu, Ptol. ii. 2. § 5), pro­

bably situated upon Sligo Bay.

NAHALAL (NogadA, LXX.), a city of the tribe

of Zabulon, mentioned only in Joshua (xix. 15).

Eusebius identifies it with a village named Niln

(NeiAd), in Batanaca; but Reland justly remarks,

that this is without the territory of the tribe of

Zabulon. (Palaestina, s. v. p. 904.) [G. W.]

NAHARVALI, one of the most powerful tribes

of the Lygii, in the north-east of Germany. Tacitus

(Germ. 43) relates that the country inhabited by

them (probably about the Vistula) contained an

ancient and much revered grove, presided over by a

priest in female attire. It was sacred to twin gods

called Alcis, whom Tacitus identifies with Castor

and Pollux. (Latham on Toe. Germ. I. c; Sprcn-

gel. Erlaiiter. zu Tac. Germ. p. 140.) [L. S.J

NA1N (Nail'), a village of Palestine, mentioned

by St. Luke as the scene of the raising of the widow's

son (vii. 11). Eusebius places it two miles S. of

Mount Tabor, near Endor. in the district of Scytho-

polis (Onoma.it. «. vi\ 'Hvo<ip and No(fi), where a

poor village of the same name is found at the present

day, on the northern slope of Little Hermon, and a

short distance to the W. of 'Ain-dor. (Robinson,

Bib. Ret. vol. iii. p. 226.) [G. W.]

sia, situated in the district Dardania, upon an eastern

tributary of the river Margus, and upon the military

road running through this country. It was in the

neighbourhood of Naissus that Claudius II. gained
