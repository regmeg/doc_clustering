VABAR, a river of Manretania Caesariensis, which

fell into the sea a little to the W. of Saldae. Ptolemy

(iv. 2. § 9) mentions it under the name of OCaSap as

if it hud been a town ; and Mallei (Mas. 1'tr. p 463)

thought that he had discovered such a place iu the

name of Bavares, in an Afi hail inscription (cf. Orelli,

Inscr. no. 529). In Pliny (v. 2. s. 1) and Mela (i.

(1) the name is erroneously written Nabar. It is

probably the present Buberak. [T. H. D.j
