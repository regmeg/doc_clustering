276 MARIANA FOSSA, MARITIMA.

on the site previously occupied by the Greek city of

Nicaea mentioned by l>iodt»rus (Hiod. v. 13; Clu-

ver. Sicil. p. 508). Its name is mentioned in tlic

Antonine Itinerary (|>. 85), wiiicherroneously reck­

ons it 40 miles from Aleria; the nuns of Mariana,

which are still extant under their ancient name at

the mouth of the river G*4o, being only about 30 I

miles X. of those of Aleria. They are 15 miles S.'

of the modern city of Bastia, The ancient remains

are inconsiderable, but a ruined cathedral still marks I

the site, and L'ives title to tlic bishop who now rc-

tdd'-s at Bastia. (Rampoldi, Dtz. G?<>qr. vol. ii.

p. 5*0.) [E. H.B.]

MAIilA'XA FOSSA. [Fossa Mariana.]

MARIAXDY'NI (MamatSuroi. Mafwa^rji o't, or

Ma. vav5yrui), an ancient and celebrated tribe in tlic

north-east of Bithynia, between the rivers San-

parius and Billaeus, on the east of the tribe called

1 hym or Uithyni. (Se\li.\, p. 34; 1'iin. vi. 1.)

According to Scylax. they diJ not extend as far

west nsthe Sangarius, fur aceurding to him the river \

Hypiui formed the boundary between the Bithyni

and Mariundyni. Strabo (vii. p. 295) expresses a i

belief that the Mariandyni were a branch of the

Itiihvuians. a belief to whieh he was probably led

by the resemblance between their name-, and which

cannot be well reconciled with the statement of

Herodotus (iii. 90), who clearly di.-tin_'ui-iics tite

Mariainlym from the Thr.n ians or Thyni in Asia.

In the Persian army, also, they appear quite Repa-

rated from the Bithyni, and their armour resembles

that of the Paphlagonians, which was quite dif­

ferent from that of iheBithyni. (Herod, vii. 72, 75;

com p. Strab. vii. p. 345. xii. p. 54°..) The chief city ,

in their territory was Heraclea Fontica, the in­

habitant-* of which reduced the Mariandym, fir a!

time, to a state of servitude resembling that of the

Cretan Miioae, or the Thessalian Penestae. To what

rare they belonged is uncertain, though if their!

TJiracian origin be given up, it must probably be

admitted that thev were akin to the Paphlagonians.

In tin* division of the Persian empire they formed

[«rt of the third Persian satrapy. Their country

was called Mariand vnu (Ma^iaroun'a, Stepli, B.

g. r.), and Pliny speaks of a Sinus Mariandynus on

their cost. (Coinp. lb-rat. Eragm. 201: Aescbyl. |

MAUI \'.\TS MON'S (to Mapiaioe Spas, Ptol.

Sierra Morena), a mountain in Hispania Baetica, i

pn»j*cily only a western offshoot of the Orosjieda,

and probably the mountain which Strabo describe*, i

(iii. ]>. \ 42). without mentioning its name, as

running parallel to the river Bactis, and lull of

mines. Hence Pliny (xxxiv. 2) speaks of 11 aes

Marianum, quod et Cordabense dicitur." The

eastern part of this mountain was called Salt us

Castulonensis. [Caktplo.]

MARIO'NIS (MapiuTis). Two towns of this name

are mentioned by Ptolemy (ii. 11. § 27 ) in the norta-

west of Germany. As the name wins to indicate!

maritime town, it has been inferred that one of ibra

nothing certain can be said about the matter. [L->.]

alone mentions them, in long. S0° 30'. lat. 2lc

and round wnieh he croups the various tribes oi ih

part of the peninsula, viz., the Melangitae (Ms*.*1

south: to the east of the Ust were the Cat tab*

mouth. Pliny in a passage before (juotetl [Fossa 3d

KIANA. Vol. I. p. 912], also calls" Maritima a tc

of the Avatiei. above whirli are the Campi Lai *--

Ptolemy (ii. 18. § 8) places Maritima of the Aval

ea>t of the eastern branch of the Rhone, and he c

it Colonia. The name is Avatiei in the Greek, te

of Ptolemy that are now printed, but it is Anaiu

the Latin text of Pirckeym, and T-erhap» ia o«

Latin texts. It does not seem certain which ii

true reading. Walekenaer (Gtog. toL l

188) assumes that Anatili is the true r«uii:^

Ptolemy.

D'Anville coneludes that Maritima was be<,a

Marseille and the canal of Man us, and that .\

tigues is the site; but there is no reA.-%nn f-ir v

on Martifptrs, except that it is between the K

and Marseille, and that there is some huh* rv

blance between the two names. It is s*:d tfcj

traces of remains have l>ern found at Ma.- '-
