Sape (S«&aA), on the left bank, 17 days' journey

above Meroe, and Daron again on the Arabian side.

Without being able to define the position of this

tribe, or to state their relations to the Aethiopians of

Meroe, we shall perhaps not err in placing them on

the nine Nile [AstafI's], and in the neighbour­

hood of Axume. The geographers (Heeren, &c.)

who describe the Sembritae as dwelling near the

White Nile, have forgotten both their vicinity to

Arabia — i. e. the eastern portion of Meroe — and tlie

character of the regions which the Astapus and

Astuboras respectively water. The White Kile flows

through lagoons and morasses unsuited for towns

and permanent settlements; while the Blue Nile bus

always had on its hanks a numerous population,

dwelling in large villages and towns. Along the

Bine Nile ran the principal highways of the trade

of Aegypt with Southern Aetbiopia, while the White

Nile led off to the uncivilised and scattered tribes

of the Libyans. The Sembritae, if seated on the

latter river, would probably have eluded observation

altogether; whereas on the former they would be as

well known to the caravans and their guides as any

other of the Aethiopian races. Moreover, the meso-

putamian districts suited to towns he to the east of

Aethiopia Proper, and would allbrd a secure retreat

to the refugees from Aegypt in search of a new ha­

bitation. (See Cooley's Claudius Ptolemy and the

Nile, pp. 7—27.) The present Stnaar eorrespmds

nearly with the territory of the Sembritae. [W.B.D.]

SEMIRA'MIDIS HONS {ZffxttpatilSos o>s), a

remarkable circular mountain on the N. side of the

Persian gulf, and the eastern limit of Caramania. It

i> noticed both by Arrian (Peri/A. M. E. p. 20. ed.

Huds.) and by Marcian {Peripl. M. Ext. c. 27, ed.

Mtiller, 1855), who states that it was opposite to

Jit. Pasabo, in Arabia, and that these two moun­

tains, with their promontories, form the straits at

the entrance of the gulf of Persia. Ptolemy speaks

of it, and states that it was also called Strongylus,

probably from its fVrin (vi. 8. § 11). Its modern

name appears to be Elbourz. (Vincent, Voyage of

Xearchus, i. p. 319—321.) [V.]

SEMNOXES (2*jUfwi'es or 2,cp.vov*s\ or per­

haps more correctly Scnnones, are described as

the most ancient and illustrious among the Suevi

in the north of Germany. They dwelt between the

Albis and Viadus, being surrounded on the west by

the Cherusei, on the south by the Silingi, on the

east by the Manimi and Burgundiones, and on the

north-west by the Longobardi. (Tac. Germ. 39;

Ptol. ii. 11. §5 15, 17; Veil. Pat. ii. 10G.)

Their country accordingly extended from the hills

of Lumtia in the south, as far as Potsdam in

the north, and in it they formed 100 commu­

nities {pagi), which gave them such strength

that they regarded themselves as the head of the

Suevi. Their country contained an ancient forest

(Scmnonum Silva), hallowed by awful superstition

and sacrificial rite.-.; at stated seasons deputies from

all the kindred tribes met in it, and commenced

their proceedings with a human sacrifice. No one,

moreover, was allowed to enter this forest except lie

was bound in chains, a mark of humiliation in the

presence "f the god; and if any one stumbled he was

not permitted to rise, but had to crawl alone. As

to the history of the Semitones, we learn from Ta­

citus {Ann. ii. 45) and Strabo (v». p. 290) that in

the time of Augustus they were united with the

Marcomanni under MaroboduuH. In the Monu-

mentuin Ancyranum the Semnunes, are mentioned
