Alcibiades was commanding for the Athenians in

the Propontis (d. c. 410), the people of Selymbria

refused to admit his army into the town, but gave

him money, probably in order to induce him to ab­

stain from forcing an entrance. (Xen. Hell. i. 1.

§21.) Some time after this, however, he gained

possession of the place through the treachery of

some of the townspeople, and, having levied a con­

tribution npon its inhabitants, left a garrison in it.

(lb. 3. § 10; l'lut. Alcib. 30.) Selymbria is men­

tioned by Demosthenes (/. c.) in B. c. 351, as in alli­

ance with the Athenians; and it wis no doubt at

that time a member of the Byzantine confederacy.

According to a letter of Philip, quoted in the ora­

tion d> Corona (p. 251, It), it was blockaded by him

about B. c. 343; but Professor Newman considers

that this mention of Selymbria is one of the numerous

proofs that the documents inserted in that speech

are not authentic. {Class. Mut. vol. i. pp. 153,

rection as far an those of the Serus. It is probably

SEMBRI'TAE (Itutplrat, Strab. xvi. pp. "70

—786; Skmbkriutak, Plin. vi. 30. s. 35), a peo­

ple inhabiting the district of Tenesis in Aethiopia, al­

though they seem to have been of Aegyptian origin.

The first mention of the Sembritae occurs in Erato­

sthenes (ap. Strab. xvii. p. 786), who says that they

occupied aa island above Meroe; that their name

implies u immigrants;" that they descerided from

the Aegyptian war-caste, who, in the reign of Psain-

mitichus (b. c. 658), abnadoned their natiro land;

and that tbey were governed by a queen, although

they were also dependent on the sovereigns of Meroe.

Artemidorus, also quoted by Strabo (xvi. p. 770),

says on the contrary, that they were the ruling order

in Meroe: these accounts, however, may be recon­

ciled by the supposition that Eratosthenes and Arte­

midorus described them at different periods. If the

Sembritae were the Aegyptian refugees, they were

also the Automoloi CAauix) noticed by Herodotus

(ii. 30). l'liny (/. c.) speaks of four islands of tlie

Sembritae, each containing one or more towns. These

were therefore not islands in the Nile, or in any of

its principal tributaries, the Astapus, or Astaboras,

but tracts between rivers, mesopotamian districts

like Men* itself, which in the language of Nubia

are still denominated " islands." The capital of the

Sembritae was, according to Pliny, Seinbobis. It

stood on the left bank of the river, 20 days' jour­

ney above Meroe". Pliny names also, among other of

their principal towns, Sai in Arabia, — i. e. on the

right bank of the Nile, for he assumes that river as

the boundary between Lybia and Arabia, — Esar or
