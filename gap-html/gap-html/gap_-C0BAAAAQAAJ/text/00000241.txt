of all the other nations of Asia Minor, being succes­

sively under the rule of Alexander the Great, the

Si-leucidae, Antiochus, Eunienes of Pergamus, and

finally under the Romans. (Liv. xxvii. 54, xxxviii.

39, 56.) Under this change of rulers, the character

of the people remained the same: daring and in­

tractable, they still continued their wild and lawless

habits, though in the course of time many Greek

settlers must have taken np their abode in the

Lycoonian towns. Under their chief Amyntas, how­

ever, whom Strabo even calls king, and who was his

own coniejnporary, the country acquired a greater

political consistency. [/>it'f. ofBioyr. under Amyn-

tas. Vol. I. p. 156.] After the death of Amyntas,

his whole kingdom, which he had greatly extended,

fell into the hands of the Romans, who constituted

the greater part of Lycaonia as a part of their pro­

vince of Cappadocia.

We may add, that Strabo regards lsauria as a

part of Lycaonia. [Isacria.] [L.S.]

LYCASTUS (Aukoittoj: Eth. AukoVtios), a

town of Crete, mentioned in the Homeric catalogue

(/£ ii. 647; comp. Pomp. Mela, ii. 7. § 13 J Plin.

iv. 12). Strabo (x. p. 479) says that it had entirely

disappeared, having been conquered and destroyed

by the Cnossians. According to Polybius (xxiii.

15) the Lycastian district was afterwards wrested

fnrni Csossus by the Gortynians, who gave it to the

neighbouring town of Rhaucus. In Mr. Pashlcy's

map the site is fixed at Kaenitria. (Hock, Kreta,

vol i. pp. 15, 414.) [E. B. J.]

LYCASTUS or LYCASTUM (AiWtoi), a very

ancient town in Pontus, on a river bearing the same

name. It was situated 20 stadia south-east of

Arnisus. (Scyl. Peripl. p. 33; Marcian, p. 74; Pe-

ripLPunt. F.tae. p. 10; Stcph. B. s.v. XaS.o-ia; I'lin.

vi. 3; Mrla, i. 19, who calls it Lycasto.) Pherecydes

(op. Scliol. ad Apoll. lihcxL ii. 373, comp. ad ii.

1001) spoke of a town of Lycastia, inhabited by

Amazon*, and situated between Themiscyra and

Cbaybia. The river Lycastua was but a small

stream, which after a short course emptied itself

iolo the Kuxine cl«*e by the town of Lyrastus.

LYCHNIDUS (Ai>x>"°°»: >-'<*• AvX"iS'oi, Au-

XH-njf.Steph. B.; Ptol. iii. 13. § 32), the chief town

of the bassaretae in Illyricum. From its position

(•n the frontier it was always a place of considerable

importance, and the name frequently occurs in the

wars of the Romans with Philippus V. and Perseus,

kmgt of Macedon. (Liv. xxvii. 32, xxxiii. 34.

xliii. 9, 10, 21; Avx*'', Polyb. xviii. 30.) After­

wards it continued to be. as on the Candavian way

described by Polybius (Avx^'Siok, xxxiv. 12). one

of llie principal points on the Egnatian road. (Strab.

vii. p. 323; J tin. A nton.; Pent. Tab.; Itln.JIiero.Kl.:

in the Jerusalem Itinerary the original reads Cledo.)

Umler the Byzantine empire it appears to have been

a lar^e and populous town, but was nearly destroyed

by an earthquake during the reign of Justinian.

which from the duta of the Itineraries must be placed

near the S. extremity of the Lake Lychnitis, on its

E. shore* (L«ike, Xorth. Greece, vol. iii. p. 281),

Achjuua («Ti|i' 'Axpi^o, 'OxP't', 'Axair, of the

tile capital uif the Bulgarian empire. Some geo-

graphers have supposed that Achrida is the same

as Justiniana; this identification, which is a mis­

take, has arisen from the circumstance that the

metropolitans of Achrida called themselves after the

emperor Justinian. Justiniana Prima is the modern

town of Kostendil. (Schafarik, Slur. Alt vol. ii.

p. 227.) The Slavonic name survives in the modern

Akridha, on the NE. shores of the lake. [E. B. J.]

LYCHNITIS. 1. (Auxwtis, ij Avxftita

Aiyan), Polyb. v. 108), a lake of Illyricum, first

mentioned by Scymnus of Chios (429). Philip

pushed his conquests over the Illyrian tribes as far

as this lake (Diod. xvi. 8). The lake of Akridha

or Okridha, which abounds in fish (comp. Strab.

vii. p. 327), represents Lychnitis. (Leake, Northeint

Greece, vol. i. p. 328, vol.' iii. pp. 280,328.)

2. (Ai/x"*T'y i comp. Steph. B. s. v. Av%vt-

oos), a lake of the Greater Armenia, which

Ptolemy (v. 13. § 8) places in long. 78° and lat.

43° 15'. It has been identified with the lake

Gokdje Deniz, or Se.vanga to the N\V. of Erivan,

the true position of which is lat. 40° 37'. The river

Zengue, which flows out of the lake and communi­

cates with the Araxea, is not mentioned by Ptolemy.

LY'CIA (Auici'a: Eth. AvKiot), a country on the

south coast of Asia Minor, forming part of tho

region now called Tekeh. It is bounded on the west

by Caria, on the north by l'hrygia and Pisidia, and

on the north-east by Pamphylia, while the whole

of the south is washed by the part of the Medi­

terranean called the Lycian sea. The western

frontier is formed by the river Glaucus and Mount

Daedala (Strab. xiv. p. 664), the northern by the

range of Mount Taurus, and the eastern one by

Mount Climax. The whole extent of the country,

from east to west, amounts, according to Strabo, to

1720 stadia: this measurement, however, must have

been made along the line of coast, for a straight line

from east to west does not amount to more than one-

half that distance. Its extent from the sea to the

northern boundary is different in the different parts,

but is everywhere smaller than that from east to

west. Until very recently, Lycia, with its rich

remains of antiquity, was almost a terra incognita,

— having never been visited by European travellers,

until Sir Charles Fellows, in 1838, and a second

time in 1840, travelled the country; since which

time it has been explored and described by several

other men of learning and science, whose works will

be noticed below.

1. Name of the Country. — The name Lycia and

Lycians is perfectly familiar to Homer, and the

poet appears to have been better acquainted with

Lycia than with some other parts of Asia Minor, for

he knew the river Xanthus and Cape Chimaera.

{II. vi. 171, &c, x. 430, xii. 312, &c, Od. v. 282,

and elsewhere.) But, according to Herodotus (i.

173), the ancient name of tho country had been

Milyas (?'; MiAi/ds), and that of the inhabitants

Solymi (2oAv>*oi), and Tremilae or Termilae (Tp«-

/xiAai or Tfo^iAai). Thete latter are said to

have been conquered, and expelled from the coast

districts by Siirpedon, the brother of Minos, who,

with a band of Cretans, invaded the country and

conquered it, but without changing either its name

or that of the people. But in his reign. Lye us, the
