PERISADYES (DaairttoWr, ntpieoom), H-

lyrian people, near the silver mines of Damastium,

whose name seems to be corrupt. (Strab. vii. p. 326;

Kramer and Groskurd, ad loc.)

PER1TUR, a pbtce in Lower Pannonia (/(as.

Iiierot. p. 562), probably the same as the one men­

tioned iu the Peuting. Table under the name of

Piretis, and in the Antonine Itinerary (p. 266) under

that of Pyrri or Pyrrum, and situated on the road

from Petovio to Siscia. (See Wesseling, ad It.

PEKNE (TUprn), a small island off the coast of

Ionia, which, during an earthquake, became united

with the territory of Miletus. (Plin. ii. 91.) There

was aleo a town in Thrace of this name, which is

mentioned only by Strph. B. («. r.) [L. S.]

PERNICIACUM, or PERNACUM in the Table,

in North Gallia, is placed on a road from Bagacum

(Batai) to Aduatuca (Tongtm). The road passed

from Bagacum to Geminiacum (Gemblou). From

Geminiacum to Perniciacum is xii. in the Anton.

I tin., and xiiii. in the Table; and from Perniciacum

to Aduatuca is xiv. in the Itin. and xvi. in the

Table. The road is generally straight, but there is

no place which we can identify as the site of Perni­

ciacum; and the geographers do not agree on any

position. [G. L.]

PERORSI (nVpopffoi, Hipopaoi, Ptol. iv. 6. §§

16,17; Polyb.op. Plin. v. l.s.8,vi. 35),a people of

Libya, subdued by Snetouius Puullinus, who in­

habited a few fertile spots spread over the long

extent of maritime country between the Canarii,

who dwelt opposite to the Fortunate Islands, and

the Pharusii, who occupied the banks of the

Senegal. (Leake, London Geog. Journ. vol. ii. p.

17.) [E.B.J.]

PERPERE'NA (rHpwfp^wx), a place in Mysia,

on the south-cast of Adramyttium, in the neigh­

bourhood of which there were copper mines and good

vineyards. It was said by some to be the place in

which Thucydides had died. (Strab. xiii. p. 607;

Plin. v. 32; Steph. B. ». r. napwdpen', from whom

we leam that some called the place Perine; while

Ptol. v. 2. § 16, calls it Pcrpere or Pcrmere; Galen,

flcpl ft^vuiat, p. 358; comp. Sestini, p. 75.)

Some, without sutficient reason, regard Perperena as

identical with Theodosiupolis, mentioned by lliero-

des(p. 661).

PERSABU'RA (nTjpo-aSwpa, Zosim. iii. 17), a

very strong place iu Mesopotamia, on the W. bank

of the Euphrates, to which the emperor Julian caino

in his march across that country. Zosiinus, who

gives a detailed account of its siege, states that it

was in size and importance second only to Cteai-

phon. Ammianus, speaking of the same war, calls

the place Pirisabora (xxiv. c. 2) ; and Libanius

Soph, mcutions u city of the same name as the then

ruling king of Persia, evidently supposing that it de­

rived its name from Sapor (or SliaJipur). {Oral.

Fun. p. 315.) Forbiger has conjectured that it

is represented by the present A ubar, and that it was

situated near the part of the river Euphrates whenco

the canal A'oAr-jorej flows, and no great distance

from the Sipphara of Ptolemy (v. 18. § 7). [V.]
