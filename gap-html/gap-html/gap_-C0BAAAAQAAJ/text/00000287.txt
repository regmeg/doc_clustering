MARATHON. MARATHUS. 269

The exact ground occupied by the Greek and

Persian armies at the battle of Marathon can only

be a matter of conjecture. Col. Leake, whose

account is both probable and consistent, though Mr.

1 ■ ■ !■■ differs from him, supposes that the Athe­

nian camp was in the valley of I rand near its open­

ing into the plain: that on the day of battle the

Athenian line extended from a little in front of

the Heracleium, at the foot of Mt. Argaliki,

to the bend of the river of Marathona, below the

village of Seftrri; and that the Persians, who were

8 tUdia in front of them, had their right resting on

Mt. Koraki, and their left extending to the southern

marsh, which prevented them from having a front

much greater than that of the Athenians. (See

Plan. AA, BB.) When the Persians defeated the

Athenian centre, they pursued the latter up one or

both of the two valleys on either side of Mt.

Kotroni, since Herodotus says that the pursuit

continued quite into the interior («s rty fitvoyatav').

Nearly at the tame time the Persian left and right

were defeated; but instead of pursuing them, the

Athenians returned towards the field to the aid of

their own centre. The Persian right fled towards

the narrow pass leading into the plain of Tricory-

thus; and here numbers were forced into the marsh,

as Pausanias relates.
