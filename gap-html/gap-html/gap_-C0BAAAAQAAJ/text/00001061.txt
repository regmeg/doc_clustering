Tabor and the sea of Tiberias

(t'HomatL s.1>.) Bat as the name is here intro-

aurtd in connection with Lebanon and Carmei,—

Rwhin brine also introduced,—and as no other

■din of a Ualilaean Sharon is to be met with, it

teems more reasonable to refer the notice in Isaiah

le the plain of Sharon on the west coast.

X Tbere was certainly another Sharon beyond Jor-

M, ipparentlv near the region of Gilead, for the chil-

irtn <i Abihail, of the tribe of Gad, are said to have

*d*elt in Gilead in Bashan, and in her towns, anil  
a »U the suburb)! of Sharon" (1 Citron, v. 16); and

! i> possible that * the herds that fed in Sharon,"

jidrr charge of David's chief herdsman, Sbitrai the

<iaroi:ite, may bare pastured in this trans-Jordanic

! itrict, not in the plain of the Mediterranean.

ieltad indeed maintains that the mention of the

slurbs of Sharon in connection with the Gadites, is

>. proof of the existence of a trans-Jordanic Sharon,

t that, as the tribe of Gad was specially addicted

• pastoral pursuits, they may have pastured their

Ixki in the suburbs of the towns of other and dis-

avt tribes. But this hypothesis seems much more

orml than the very natural theory of a second

•lirun in the tribe of Gad properly so called.

SUAVEH (LXX.Vat.na-oiAar tooSa«v, Alex, fj

u ," where Melchizedek met Abraham returning from

t* tLinghter of the kings. (Gen. xiv. 17.) The

urard are not agreed concerning the city of Melchi-

ssek. They who regard his Salem as identical with

Tjjahrm, uaturally identify " the king's dale," equi-

ilrtit to " the valley of Shaveh," with " the king's

si* ~ where Absalom erected his monument (2 Sam.

SHUNEM (LXX. istuar: Etk. Zufiavrrhs, 2«-

•nrif), a village of Palestine celebrated as the

rifcpiac* of Abishag (1 Kings, i. 3), and for the

uncle of Eliaha. (2 Kings, iv.) It was situated

i l«achar (Jotk. xix. 18; LXX. Sowdp), near

'JUn, to the north; for when Saul and the Is-

raelitcs were encamped in Gilboa, the Philistines

pitched in Shunem, so that he had to pass through

their lines to come to Endor. (1 Sam. xxviii. 4.)

Eusebius mentions a village named Sanim, in the bor­

ders of Sebaste, in the district of Acrebattene, which

cannot be identical with this. But the Subem (2ov-

(ffju) of the same author, which he places v. M. P.

south of Mount Tabor, corresponds very well with the

site of the modern village of Sulam, which still marks

the site of ancient Shunem. It is a miserable

village, situated above the plain of Esdraelon, on

the road between Jenin and Nazareth, about \\

hour north of Zer'in, ancient Jezreel, on the steep

slope of the western spur of Little Hermon (Ed-

Vihy). [G. YV.]

SHUR (2oi!o, LXX.), a place repeatedly mentioned

to describe the western extremity of the borders of

the posterity of Islimael (Gen. xxv. 18), of the

Amalekites only (1 Sam. xv. 7), of the Geshuritcs,

Gezrites, and Amalekites (xxvii. 8), in all which

passages it is placed " over against," "before," and

on tbe way to Egypt. Hagar's well, afterwards

called Beer-lahai-roi, between Kadesb and Bered,

was "in tbe way to Sbur." (Gen. xvi. 7, 14.)

The name is still found in the south of Palestine.

"Moilahki (— Beer-lahai-roi) lies on tbe great road

from Beersheba to Shur, or Jebel-es-Sur, which is

its present name,—a grand chain of mountains

running north and south, a little east of the longi­

tude of Suez, lying, as Shur did, before Egypt.

(Gen. xvi. 7.) It lies at the south-west ex­

tremity of tbe plain of Paran, as Kadesh does

at its utmost north-east extremity. (Rowlands, in

Williams's Holy City, vol. i. appendix No. 1. pp.

465, 466.) [G. W.]

SHUSHAN. [Susa.]

S1AGUL (SiayovK, l'tol. iv. 3. § 9, (the most

easterly town of Zeugitana, only 3 miles from the

coast, and to which Putput served as a harbour.

Shaw (Travels, ch. 2) identifies it with some ruins

at the villsge of Kassir-Asseite, from two inscrip­

tions which he found there, with the words Civ.

Siagitana; but which he must have read incorrectly,

since the town would have been called Siagulitana.

According to Mafiei (Mas. Veron. p. 457. 2) there

is also an inscription with the words Civ. Siagitana

near Turn in Africa; which Orelli (i. p. 334) re­

fers either to Sigus in Numidia or to Sigu in Mauri­

tania Caesariensis. [T. II. D.j

SIATA, an island on the Gallic coast, which is

mentioned in the Maritime Itin. after Vindilis, or

Belle Isle. D'Anville conjectures Siata to be the

Isle de Hoitat, which is off the coast of the depart­

ment of Murbiltan, and between Belle Isle and the

mainland. [G. I..]

SIATUTANDA (2iaroi>ra*oa), is mentioned by

Ptolemy (ii. 11. § 27) as a town of Germany; but

had probably no existence at all, the geographer

imagining that in the words of Tacitus (Ann. iv.

73), "ad sua tntanda digressis rebellious" the name

of some town was contained. Notwithstanding this

evident origin of the name, some modern geographers

still persist in assuming a town Siatutanda. [L.S.]
