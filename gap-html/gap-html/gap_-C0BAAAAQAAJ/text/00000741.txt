iwatiai of the name in history occurs in the Second

I'rur War, when Liry tell* us that the Roman pco-

[Iff. zxvii. 51). Hence, when Aurelius Victor

«■»« it among the works constructed by Aemilius

:c ibis ran refer only to its rebuilding or restor-

«ul (Vict, sfe fir. lUustr. 72.) It is very pos-

.V tiiat there was no stone bridge before that time,

t' time of the conspiracy of Catiline, the Mil-

.-Matadors of the Allobroges were arrested by tlie

r-frs of Cicero, (hall. Cat. 45; Cic. in Cat. iii.

VKS SALA'RJCS (Punte Salnra), a bridge on

Vj SaJaria where that highroad crossed the

■ ' Tftmrnr) about 2] miles from Rome. From

-sMKB this is certainly the bridge meant by

the name of Pons Anienis, on which the

can mentioned in history, but we learn

wm o«Bstrocted by Narses, in the room of the

'a-umi *ie which had becu destroyed by Totila

in A. I). 547, when he broke up the siege of Rome

and withdrew to Tibur. (Procop. B. G. iii. 24;

Nibby, Dmtorni, vol. ii. p. 594.) [E. H. B.]

PONS SARAVI, a bridge over the Baravua

(Sarre) in Gallia on the road from Divudurum

(Mttz) to Argentoratum (Strassburg). The Table

marks 10 from Deoem-pagi (Diet/ze) to Tabernae

(>'-/'■( rue). Though the distances are not quite

correct, it is clear that Saarburg on the Sarre must

be the Pons Saravi: and it cannot be Saarbruck oil

the Soar, fur Stiarbriick is more than 30 miles north

of Saarburg, and quite out of the way. This is an

instance in which a hasty conclusion has been

derived solely from the sameness of name. [G. L.]

PONS SCALDIS, or bridge over the Scheldt in

North Gallia, is placed both by the Table and the

Antoninc Itin. on the road from Turn-scum ( Tournai)

to Bagacum (Bavai). There is a place on the

Schelde nnmed Escaut-pont between Valenciennes

and Condi which may represent the Pons. [G. L.]

PONS SERVl'LII. [Iu.yiucum, Vol. II. p.

36, b.]

PONS TILURI, a station on the road from Sir-

mium to Salona, in the interior of Dalmatia. (Itin

Anion, j Tilurium. Peut. Tab.; Oeogr. Rav. iv. 16.)

It may be identified with the passage of the river

Cettina or Ttettina (Tilurus). at Trigl, with the

opposite height of Gardun. where there are ves­

tiges of a Roman town, which was probably the

colony of Aeqi i;5I (A.koCuk k&K. Ptol. ii. 16 (17).

§ II j 11in. Anton.; Peut. Tab.; Orelli, Inter.

502), where an inscription linn been found com.

memorating the restoration of the bridge under the

name of Pons Htm,—a Graecised form of the

Latin name of the town, whirh was sometimes

spelt as Equutn. (Wilkinson, Dalnuitia, vol. i. p.238;

Nfieebaur, Die Sud-Slaren, p. 178.) [E. B. J.]

PONS UCASI, a town of Thrace, near the l)a-

cian border, (/tin. Ant. p. 567.) [T. H. D.]

PONS ZITHA, a station on the Roman road

running along the coast-line of Syrl ica, and a mu-

nicipium. (/tin. AntotL ; Geogr. Rav.) In the

Peutingcr Table it is wrongly called Liha. Barth

(II'andervngeu, p. 263) has fixed its site at the

promontory opposite to Meninx, where lie found

remains of a stone bridge or mole connecting the

mainland with the island of the I^tophagi. [E.B.J.]

l'ONTKM, AD, a town of Britain, on the road

from Londiniuui to Linduin (/tin. Ant. p. 477),

identified by Camden (p. 560) with Paunton on the

Witham, in Lincolnshiret, whrre a great many

Roman coins and antiquities have been discovered.

Others take it to have been Farndon, near South­

well, in Nottinghamshire. [T. II. D.]

PONTES, in North Gallia, is placed in the Ant.

Itin. on a road from Samarobriva (.-Inu'ens) to Ge-

soriacum (Boulogne): it is 36 M. P. from Samaro­

briva to Pontes, and 39 M. P. from Pontes to Gc-

soriacum. The Table, which marks a road between

Samarobriva and Gesoriacuin, does not place Pontes

on it, but it has another place, named Duruicoregnm,

supposed to be JJauriers on the Aulhie. D'Anville

concludes that Pontes is Punches on the A uthie. at

which place we arrive by following the traces of the

old road which still exists under the name of

Chaussee dp, Brune'haut. [G. L.]

PON I ES, a Roman station in the territory of the

Ati-ebates. seateil on the Thames, on the road from

Calleva (SilcAesfer) to Londinium (Itin. Ant. p.

478). It was at or near Old Windsor. [T. II. I).]
