Sicily; while the countries nearer home were not

neglected, for Soli in Cilicia, and Gagae and Cory-

dalla in Lycia, were likewise Rhodian colonies. But

notwithstanding tlii.s early application to navigation

and commerce, for which Rhodes is so admirably

situated between the three ancient continent;*, the

11 hod tans were not ranked with the great maritime

powers of Greece. Herodotus speaks of them only

as forming a part of the Doric confederacy, nor does

Thucydides mention their inland more frequently.

The Rhodians, in fact, did not attain to any political

eminence, among the states of Greece until about

B.C. 408, when the three ancient towns conjointly

built the city of Rhodes at the northern ex­

tremity of the island, and raided it to the rank

of a capital. During the first period of tlie Pe-

loponncsian War the towns of Rhodes paid tribute

to Athens, and were reluctantly compelled to

serve against Syracuse and Gela in Sicily (Thuc.

vii. 57); but in B.C. 412 they joined the Pelo-

ponnesians. The popular party being favourable to

Athens, soon afterwards attempted a reaction, but it

was crushed (Diod. xiii. 38. 45). In b. c. 396,

however, when Conon appeared with his fleet in the

waters of Rhodes, the Rhodians again embraced the

cause of Athens (Diod. xiv. 79; Pans. vi. 7. § 6);

but the democracy which was now established was

ill managed, and did not last long; and as early as

n. c. 390, the exiled aristocrats, with the assistance

of Sparta, recovered their farmer ascendancy. (Aris-

tot. Polity, 4. 2; Xenoph. Ilellcn. iv. 8. § 20. &c;

Di»>d. xiv. 97.) The fear of Sparta's growing

power once more threw Rhodes into the hands of the

Athenians, but soon after the battle of Leuctra a

change again took place; at least the Tliebans, in

B. c. 364, were zealously engaged in sowing discord

for the purpose of drawing Rhodes, Chios, and By­

zantium over to their own side During the Social

War, from n. c. 337 to 355, the Rhodians were ar­

rayed against Athens, being instigated by the dynast

of Caria and bis successor Artemisia. But as they

became alarmed by the grow ing power of the Carian

dynasty, they solicited the protection of Athens

thrnuirh the eloquence of Demosthenes. (Demos.

(h; Librrt. Ifhodu>r.) The form of government

throughout this period was oligarchical, which ac­

counts for the insolent conduct of Hegesiloehus, as

described in Athenaeus (x. p. 444). Rhodes fur­

nished Darius, the last king of Persia, with one of

his bravest and ablest generals in the person of

Memnon, who, if he had bad the sole direction of

affairs, might have checked the victorious career of

Alexander, and saved the Persian empire. But as

it was, Rhodes, like the rest of Greece, lost its inde-

pendence, and received a Macedonian garrison (Curt,

iv. 5). The expulsion of this garrison after the

death of Alexander was the beginning of a glorious

epoch in the history of Rhodes; for during the wars

against the successors of Alexander, and especially

during the memorable siege of the city of Rhodes

by Demetrius Poliorcetes, the Rhinlians gained the

highest esteem and regard from all the surrounding

princes and nations. Durirnr the period winch then

followed, down to the overthrow of the Macedonian

monarchy, Rhodus, which kept up friendly relations

with Rome, acted a very prominent part, and ex­

tended its dominion over a portion of the op}>osite

coasts of Caria and Lycia—a territory which is hence

often called the Utpala rwv 'Po&iwv [Pkkaka] —

and over several of the neighbouring islands, such as

Casus, Carpatbus, Telos, and Chalce. After the

defeat of Perseus the Romans deprived tkV.V'-Viri

of a great amount of territory and power, Bruin i-r
