LACTARIUS MOXS. LAEDERATA. 118

an? known only from having, in the Marcomannic war,

opposed a body of invading Astings, and, having so

dow. contracted an alliance with Rome. [R. G. L.]

LACTA'RIUS MOXS (rdXeucros opov: Monte

S. Angth), was the name given by the Romans to

a mountain in the neighbourhood of Stabiae in Cam­

pania. It was derived from the circumstance that

the mountain abounded in excellent pastures, which

were famous for the quality of the milk they pro­

duced; on which account the mountain was resorted

to by invalids, especially in cases of consumption,

for which a milk diet was considered particularly

bweScial. (Cassiod. Kp. xi. 10; Galen, de Meth.

MttL t. 12.) It was at the foot' of this mountain

that Xar?es obtained a great victory over the Guths

under TeTas in a. d. 553, in which the Gothic king

ww 6lain. (Procop, B. G. iv. 35, 36.) The de­

scription of the M«»ns Lactarius, and its position

wi'Ji regard to Stabiae, leave no doubt that it was a

p*rt of the mountain range which branches off from

tie Apennines near Xocera (Xuceria), and separates

u\» Bay of SapUs from that of Paestum. The

Li^rwst point of this range, the Monte S. Angelo,

attains a height of above 5000 feet; the whole range

i* calcareous, and presents beautiful forests, as well

*.< abundant pastures. The name of Lettere, still  
borne by a town on the slope of the mountain side,

a little above Stabiae, is evidently a relic of the an­

cient name. [E. H. B.]

LACTORA, in Gallia Aquitania, is placed by the

Antonine Itin. on the mad between Aginnum (Agen)

inct Chmberrum (.4«cA). and 15 Gallic leagues from

eacii. The distance and name correspond to the po-

utiea and name of Lectoure. Several Roman in-

K-riptions have been discovered with the name Lac-

tonres, and Civitas Lactorensium; but the place is

cat mentioned by any extant writer. [G. L.]

LACL'S FKLICIS. a place in Noricum, on the

snath of the Danube, 25 miles west of Arelape, and

20 mita east of Laureacum (It. Ant. pp. 246, 248).

According to the Not. Impcr., where it is called La-

caiflicjs, it was the head-quarters of Xorican horse

archers. It is now generally identified with the

town of Xirderwallsee, on the Danube. [L.S.]

LACYDOX. [Masstua.]

LADK (AoStj). the largest of a group of small

tolauds in the Sinus Latmicus, close by Miletus, and

^poErte the mouth of the Macander. It was a pro­

tection to the harbours of Miletus, but in Strabo's

tis# it was one of the haunts and strongholds of

pjves. Lade is celebrated in history for the naval

*5eat sustained there by the Ionians against the  
itaians in B.C. 494. CHemd. vi. 8; Thucyd. viii.

cij.habited, i* clear from Strabo, and from the fact

rA St^plianus B. mentioning the ethnic form of the

LADlCL'S, a mountain of Gallaecia, the name of

wtitcb occurs in ancient inscriptions, and is still pre-

■wd in that of the Cotlos de Ladoco, near Monte-

f**do on the SiL (Florez, Esp. S. vol. xv. p. 63;

ftct, vol. ii. pt. 1. p. 278.) [P. S.]

LALMJCEIA (t4 AaZoK(ia), a place in Arcadia,

'3 the dUtrict Maenalia, and, after the building of

• fcriiopolU, a suburb of that city, was situated upon

t» r«ui from the latter to Paliantium and Tcgea.

«** i battle was fought between the Mantineians

«nj Teceata«>, b. c. 423, and between the Acliacans

Kd Cfettnen«t b. c 226. Thucydides calls it

Ucdiciaaj (Aavoucior) in Oresthis. (Paus. viii. 44.

§ 1; Thuc. iv. 134; Pol. it. 51,55.) [Orestha-

SIl'M.]

LADOX (fiakbv). 1. A river of Elis, flowing

into the Peneius. [Ei.is, p. 817, a.]

2. A river of Arcadia, flowing into the Alpheius.

[Alpheius.]

LAEAEI (Aoiotoi), a Paeonian tribe in Mace­

donia, included within tho dominion of Sitalces,

probably situated to the E. of the Strymon. (Thuc.

ii. 96.) [E.B.J.]

LAEAETA'NI orLEETA'XI (Aoiomuvf, PtoL

ii. 6. §§ 18, 74; Acirravof, Strab. iii. p. )59), a

people on the N. part of the E. coast of Hispania

Tarraconensis, above the Cosetani. Strabo merely

speaks vaguely of the sea-coast between the Ebro

and the "Pyrenees as belonging to "the Leetani and

the Lartolaeetae, and other such tribes" (rwv ?€

Aei7TayoJF fcai AapToAanrrwc ko\ &A\m toiovtcw),

as far as Emporium, while Ptolemy places them

about Barcino (Barcelona) and the river Rubri­

cate (Llobregat); whence it appears that they

extended from below the Rubricatus on the SW. up

to the borders of the lndigetes, upon the bay of

Emporiae, on the XE. They are undoubtedly the

same people as the Laletani of Pliny (iii. 3. s. 4;

comp. Inscr. ap. Gruter. p. cdxxx.), who speaks of

their country (Laletania) as producing good wine in

abundance. (Plin. xiv. 6. s. 8; comp. Martial, i.

27, 50, vii. 52; Sil. Ital. iii. 369, xv. 177.) Strabo

describes it as a fertile country, well furnished with

harbours. Besides their capital Barcino (Bar­

celona), they had the following towns: (1.) On the

sea coast, from SW. to XE.: Baktuko (Bcutou-

\wv, Ptol. ii. 6. § 19: Badelona; Muratori, p.

1033, no. 3; Klorez, Esp. S. vol. xxiv. p. 56, vol.

xxix. p. 31 ; Marca, Hisp. ii. 15, p. 159), with a

small river of the same name (Besosi Mela, ii. 6);

Ilitro or Ei.uko, a city of the conventus of Tarraco,

with the civitas Montana (Mela, ii. 6; Plin. iii. 3.

s. 4; AiAovpdtv, Ptol. ii. 6. § 19, where the vulgar

reading is &i\ovpu>v; prob. Mataro, Marca, Hisp.

ii. 15, p. 159; Florez, Esj>. S. vol. xxix. p. 34);

Ui.anda (BAaVSa, Ptol. I.e.: Blanes), on a height,

XE. of the mouth of the little river I.aiimm

(Tordera: Plin. iii. 3. s. 4): between Baetulo and

Iluro Ptolemy places the Lunakium Pk (Aowd-

piov ixpov; probably the headland marked by the

Torre de Mongat). (2.) On the high road from

Tarraco to Xarbo Martius in Gaul (Itin. Ant.

p. 398): Fines, 20 M. P. W. of Barcino (near

Martorell. on the right bank of the Llobregat),

marking doubtless the borders of the Laeeiani and

the Cosetani; then Barcino; next Pkaetokium,

17 M. P. (near Hostalrich or La Boca, where are

great ruins ; Marca, Hisp. ii. 20); Skteriiae or

Secerrae, 15 M. P. (prob. 5. Pere de Sercada or

SanSeloni); Aquae Voconiae, 15 M. P. (Caldas

de Malavella). (3.) Other inland towns : Rubri­

cate (Ptol.); Eoara, a municipium, whose site is

unknown (Inscr. ap. Muratori, p. 1106, no. 7,

p. 1107, no. 1); Aquae Calidae, a civitas sti-

pendiaria, in the conventus of Tarraco (Piin. iii. 3.

s. 4, Aquicaldenses: Caldas de Mombny, X. of Bar~

celona, Marca, Hisp. ii. 16, p. 167; Florez, Esp. S.

vol. xxix. p. 37; Ukert, vol. ii. pt. 1. pp. 423,

424.) [P. S.1

LAEDERATA (AcSc/mEtci or A*T«pard, Procop.

de Aed. iv. 6), a town in the north of Moenia, on

the Danube, and a few miles east of Viminacium.

In the Notitia its name is Luedenata; it must have

been near the modern Rama. [L. S.]
