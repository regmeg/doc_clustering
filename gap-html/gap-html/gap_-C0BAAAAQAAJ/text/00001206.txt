1120 TEGYFA. TEGIANUM.

hatav.'thra at the Taki did not absorb quickly

enough the waters of the marsh. The G a rates

therefore anciently flowed into the katavothra at

Persovd without having any connection with the

Alpheius. It probably derived its name from Garea

or Gareae, one of the ancient demi of Tegea, which

may have been t-ituated at the village of Dhuliand.

(Iioss, Ptloponnes, p. 70, seq.; Leake, Peloponne-

siaca, p. 112, seq.)

There were rive roads leading from Tegea. One

led due N. across the Tegeatio plain to Mantineia.

[Mantineia.] A second led due S. by the valley

of the Alpheius to Sparta, following the same route

as the present road from TripoUtzd to Mistrd.

A third led west to Pallantium. It first passed by

the small mountain Cresium (Kp-hawv), and then

ran across the Manthyric plain along the side of

the Taki. Mount Cresium is probably the small

isolated hill on which the modern village of Yunb

stands, and not the -high mountain at the cud of

the plain, according to the French map. l_*p<m

reaching the Choma (x«M°)» the road divided into

two, one road leading direct to Pallantium, and

the other SW.to Megalopolis through Asea. (Paus.

v'ui. 44. § 1, seq.; Xen. Htll. vi. 5. § 9, ai 4irl

TlaWdi'Ttof <p*pov<j<xt wvAat.) This choma

separated the territories of Pallantium and Tegea,

and extended as far south as Mount Boreium

{Krdvori), where it touched the territory of Megalo­

polis. There are still remains of this choma running

NE. to SW. by the side of the marsh of Taki, These

remains consist of large blocks of stone, and must

be regarded as the foundations of the choma, which

cannot have been a ckaussee or causeway, as the

French geographers call it, since x&fia always sig­

nifies in Greek writers an artificial heap of earth, a

tumulus, mound, or dyke. (Ross, p. 59.) A fourth

road led SE. from Tegea. by the sources of the

Garatos to Thyreatis. (Paus. viii. 54. § 4.) A

fifth road led NE. to Hysiae and Argos, across

the Corythic plain, and then across Mt. Parthe-

nium, where was a temple of Tan, erected on

the spot at which the god appeared to the cou­

rier Phetdippide.s. This road was practicable for

carriages, and was much frequented. (Paus. viii.

54. § 5. seq.; Herod, vi. 105, 106; Diet, of Bio or.

art. PiiEiDirriDEs.) (Leake, J/orea, vol. i. p. 88,

seq., vol, ii. p. .333, Pelopontttsiaca, pp. 112, seq.,

369; Ross, Peloponnes, p. 66, seq.; Curtiu^, Pelo-

ponnesos, vol. i. p. 247, seq.; Kuner, Com. de Rebus

Tegeatarum, Berol. 1843.)

The Roman poets use the adjective Tegeeus or

Te<:eaens as equivalent to Arcadian: thus it is

given as an epithet to Tan (Virg. Gtory. i. 18), Cal-

listo, daughter of Lycaon (Ov. Ar. Am. ii. 55,

Post. ii. 167), Atalanta (Ov. Met viii. 317, 380),

Oarmenta (Ov. Fast. i. 627), and Mercury (Stat.

Silv. i. 54)

TEGIA'NUM {Eth. Tegianensis: Diano), amu-

nieipal town of Lucania, situated in the interior of

that country, on the let! bank of the river Tanager.

name is preserved by inscriptkns. Fran tbe ne»
