(Ptol. v. 6. § 15.) [I.. S.]

SEBASTE (ie€a(TTT)). 1. A town in a small

island oft' the coast of Cilicia, built hy Archelaus

king of Cappadocia, to whom the Romans had given

C'ilieia Aspera. (Strab. xiv. p. 671.) It seems

to have received its name Sebaste in honour of

Augustus ; for, until his time, both the island and

the town were called Eleusa, Klaeusa, or Elaeuasa

(Joseph. Ant. xvi. 4. § 6, Bell i. 23. § 4; comp.

Ptol. v. 8. §4; Hierocl. p. 704: Stadiasm. Mar.

Sfagn. § 172, where it is called 'EAfoCs; Steph. B.

s. w. ^.tSatTTT) and 'EAcumtriTa), a name which

Pliny (v. 22) still applies to the town, though he

erroneously places it in the interior of Caria.

Stephauus, in one of the passages above referred to,

call-. Sebaste or Elaeussa an island, and in the other

a peninsula, which may be accounted for by the fact

that the narrow channel between the island and the

mainland was at an early period filled up with sand,

as it is at t lie present,- for the place no longer exists

as an Uland. S hastc was situated between Corycus

and the month of the river Lam us, from which it was

only a few miles distant. Some interesting remains

of the town of Sebaste still exist on the peninsula

near Ayashtconsisting of a temple of tlie composite

order, which appears to have been overthrown by an

earthquake, a theatre, and three aqueducts, one of

which conveyed water into the town from a consider­

able distance. (Comp. Beaufort, A'aramania, p. 250,

full.; Leake, Asia Minor, p. 213.)

2. A town in Phrygia Pacatiana, between Alyd-

da and Eumenia, is noticed only by Hierocles,

(p. 667) and in the Acts of the Council of Constan­

tinople (iii. p. 674); but its site has been identified

with that or the im-dem S'<j'ikhr, where inscriptions

and coins of the town have been found. The ancient

name of the place is still preserved in that of the

neighbouring stream, SebastiSu. (Comp. Hamilton's

Research**, i. p, 121, &c.j Arundell, Discoveries,

i. p. 136, who erroneously takes the remains at

SegiUer for those of the ancient Eucarpiu.)

[Cabira, Vol. 1. p. 402.] [L. S.]

SEBASTE. [Samauia.]

SEBASTEIA (2tSdartta), a town in the south of

p.intus, on the north hank of the I'pper llalys. As it

was near the frontier, Pliny (vi. 3) regards it as not

belonging to Poiitus, but to Cologne in Cappadocia.

(Ptol. v. 6. § 10; Hierocl. p. 702; It. Ant pp. 204,

205.) The town cxi.-ted as a small place before

tiie dominion of the Romans in those parts, but

its ancient name is unknown. Pompey increased

the town, and gave it the name of Megalopolis

(Strab. xti. p. 5r>0). The name Sfbastia must have

been given to it before the time of Pliny, he being the

first to use it. During the imperial period it appears

to have risen to considerable importance, so that in

the later division of the Empire it was made the

capital of Armenia Minor. The identity of Sebastia

with the modern Sitcas is established partly by the

resemblance uf the names, and partly by the agreement

of the site of Sheas with the dtsciiptiunoC Gncn'

Nyssa, who states that the town «&> Kftaiti n u*
