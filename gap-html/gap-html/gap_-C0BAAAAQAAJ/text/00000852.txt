was nearest to the river. "Cominius in Capitol turn

evadit" is here equivalent to ''Romulus in Capi­

tolium escendit," in a piissage befure cited. (Liv.

i. 10.) Hence, to mark the spot more precisely,

the historian inserts "ad Carmentis" in the follow­

ing chapter. There is nothing in the other autho­

rities cited in Becker's note (no. 750) which yields

a conclusion either one way or the other. We might,

with far superior justice, quote the following passage

of Cicero, which we have adduced on another occa­

sion, to prove that the attempt of the Gauls was on

theXr.r ur citadel: " Atque ut ita munita Arx cir-

cunijeetu arduo et quasi circumciso saxo niteretur,

ut etiam in ilia tempestate horribili Gallici adventus

ineolumis atque intacta permanserit" (DeHep.il.

6). But, though we hold that the attempt was

really on the Arx. we are nevertheless of opinion that

Cicero here uses the word only in its general sense,

and thus as applicable to the whole hill, just as Livy

uses Capitolium in the preceding passage. Hence,

Mr. Bunbury ((.lass. Mus. vol. iv. p. 430) and M.

IVeller (I. c.) have justly regarded this narrative as

affording no evidence at all, although they are ad­

herents of the German theory. We may further

observe, that the house of Manlius was on the Arx;

and though this circumstance, taken by itself, pre­

sents nothing decisive, yet, in the case of so sudden

:i surprise, it adds probability to the view that the

Arx was on the southern summit.

We now proceed to the next illustration, which is

drawn from the account given by Tacitus of the

attack of the Vitellians on the Capitol. Becker's

interpretation of this passage is so full of errors, that

we must follow him sentence by sentence, giving, first

of all, the original description of Tacitus. It runs as

follows: Cito aginine forum et imminentia furo

teinpla praetervecti crigunt aciem per adversum col-

Icm usque ad primas Capitolinae arcis fores. Erant

antiquitus porticus in latere clivi,dextrac subeuntibus:

in quaruni tectum egressi saxis tegulisque Vitellianos

obrucbant. Neque illis manus nisi gladiis armatae;

et arcesserc tonnenta ant missilia tela longum vide-

batur. Faces in prominent em porticum jecere et

sequebantur ignein; ambustasque Capitolii fores

penetrassent, ni Sabinus revulsas undique statuas,

decora majorum in ipso aditu vice muri objecisset.

Turn diversos CapitoUi aditus invadunt, juxta

lucuin asyli, et qua Tarpeia rupes centum gradibus

nditur. Improvisa utraque vis: propior atque

amor per asylum ingruebat. Nec sisti poterant

scandentes per conjuncta aodificia, quae, ut in multa

pace, in altum edita solum Capitolii aequabant.

Hie umbigitur, ignein tectis oppugnatores injecerint,

an obsessi, quae crebrior fama est, quo nitentes ac

progresses depellerent. Inde lapsus ignis in por­

ticus appositas aedibus: mox sustmmtes fastigium

aquilae vetcrc ligno traxerunt tiammam aluerunt-

que. 5ie Capitolium clausis fori bus indefeusuin et

imlireptum con flag rav it." (Hist. iii. 71.)

"The attack," says Becker, "is directed solely

against the Capitol; that is, the height containing

t he temple, which latter is burnt on the occasion"

(p. 390). This is so far from being the case,

that the words of Tacitus would rather show that

the attack was directed against the Arx. The

temple is represented as having been shut up, and

neither attacked nor defended: "clausis furihus,

indefensum et imlireptum eonflagravit." Such a

state of things is inconceivable, if, as Becker says,

the attack was uirected solely against the Capitol.

That part of the hill was evidently deserted, and

I left to its fate; the besieged had concentrat**

'selves upon the Arx, which thus becam* the p*-i

use of the word Capitolium, whi;.h we tart bas'-n

pointed out, we find Tacitus repre^e^tinc li*

of the Capitolium as having U-tn U."u:' *z -

contradiction, as the gates are there rr^-r-J*

as shut. But in the first passage he c>o_» 'Jt

gates of the fortification which entks*d tbi

he means the gates of the temple. Ti* m~

ing of Tacitus is also evident in another 3ii-

already gained a footing on the height aac r*ji

consequently have had M occasion to s*tk mxnt >f

other routes — by the steps of the Ru:« Tir,e*,

and by the Lucus Asyli, Becker prote^Js: 'Ta­

citus calls this (i.e. the height with the terj~*

is quite a mistake. '1 lie Arx Capitolina iaa»
