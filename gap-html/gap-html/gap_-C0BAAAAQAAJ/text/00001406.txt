1322 VOLSCI. YOLSCI.

there is little doubt that these two nations were kin­

dred races, though always distinguished from each

another as two separate peoples. We hare no state­

ment in any ancient writer as to the ethnic origin or

affinities of the VoKcians. and are left almost wholly

to conjecture on the subject. But tlie remains of the

lan^uaire, few ami scanty as they are. afford neverthe­

less tlie safest foundation onwhieh to rest ourtheories;

anil these lead vis to regard the Yolseintis as a branch

oft lie same family with the Umhrians and 0>eans, who

formed the aboriginal population of the mountain

tracts of Central Italy. It would appear, indeed, as

if they were more closely connected with the Um-

hrians than either the Sabines and their Sabellian

offshoots, or the Oscans properly so called ; it is

probable, therefore, that the Volscians had separated

at a still earlier period from the main stock of the

Umbrian race. (Mommson, Unier-ltal. L>i<thkt. pp.

319—326 ; Sehweirler, fifon. Gesch. vol. i. p. 178.)

The only notice of their language that occurs in

Roman authors, also points to it distinctly as different

from Oscan (Titinius, op. FesL v. (Jbscum, p. 189).

though the difference was undoubtedly that of two

cognate dialects, not of two radically distinct lan­

guages-

When the Volscians first appear in Roman history,

it is as a powerful and warlike nation, who were

already established in the possession of the greater

part at least of the territory which they subsequently

occupied. Their exact limits are not, indeed, to he

determined with accuracy; and it is probable that

they underwent considerable fluctuations during their

long wars with the Latins and Romans. But there

seems no doubt that from a very early period they

held the whole of the detached mountain group

S. of the Tolerus (Sacco), termed by modern geo­

grapher the Monti Lepiui, together with the valley

of the Liris, and the mountain district of Arpinum,

Sora, and Atina. Besides this they were certainlr

masters at one time of the plains extending from the

Volscian Apennines to the sea, including the Pomp-

tine Marshes and the fertile tract that borders on

them. This tract they had, according to Cato, wrested

from the Aborigines, who were its earliest possessors

(Cato ap. Priscian. v. p. G68).

The first mention of the Volsehns in Roman his­

tory is in the reign of the second Tarquin, when they

appear as a numerous and warlike people. It is

clear that it was the great extension of the Roman

power under its last king (which must undoubtedly

be admitted as a historical fact), and the supremacy

which he had assumed over the Latin League, that

first brought him into collision with the Volscians.

According to the received history he marched into

their country and took their capital city, Suessa Po-

inetia, by assault (Liv. i. 53; Dionys. iv. 50;

Cic. de litp. ii. 24.) The tradition that it was the

spoils there obtained which enabled him to build

the Capitol at Koine, sufficiently proves the belief

iu the great power and wealth of the Volscians

lit this early period ; and the foundation of the

two colonies of Cireeii and Sigma, both of which are

expressly ascribed to Tarquin, was doubtless intended

to secure bis recent conquests, and to impose a perma­

nent check on the extension of the Volscian power.

It, is evident, moreover, from the first treaty witli

Cartilage, preserved to us by Polybius (iii. 22), that

the important cities of Antium and Tarracina, as

well as Cireeii, were at tins time sul-ject to Tarquin,

and could not, therefore, have been iu the hands of

the Vulisciaiis.

seem to have allowed the Volscians toregir:i:^J

to the received annals, the -wars with the \<Hscaa

had already recommenced prior to this pern. £3

almost immediately afterwards occurs the emt «4

sudden development of their power which k r^rt-

lanns. Whatever may have been the origin * US

cities at this period fell successively ir.lo the f«<*w

It is impossible here to give more tlian a iwy

outline of the long series of wars with the Vasraaa

which occupy so prominent a place in the earij ti!-

tery of Rome for a perud of nearly two cetTnnri.

Little historical value can be attached to the 4Pii

of those wars as they were preserved by lb<iEriu*
