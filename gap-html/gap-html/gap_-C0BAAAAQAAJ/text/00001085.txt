-»« of tbe month of the Xanthua. (Plin. v.  
B. a. «.; Ptol. v. 3. § 5; Hieroclcs, p.

684; Cedrenus, p. 344.) The ruins of this city, on

a lofty height of Mount Cragus, have first been dis­

covered and described by Sir C. Fellows. (Lycin,

p. 151, full.) They arc at the village of Tortoorcnr

Bitta, and consist chiefly of splendidly built tombs,

abounding in Greek inscriptions. The town itself

appears to have been very small, and the theatre,

agora, and temples, are of diminutive size, but of

great beautv. [L. S.]

S1GA (Siya, Ptol. iv. 2. § 2), a commercial tow i>

of Mauritania Caesariensis, seated near the mouth of

a river of the same name in a large bay. The

month of the river formed the port of the city, at a

distance of 3 miles from it (Sigensis Portus, Itin.

Ant. p. 13), opposite to the island of Acra, on the

highroad, and near Cirta, the residence of Syphax.

(Strab. xvii. p. 829; Plin. v. 2. s. 1.) In Strabo'l

time it was in ruins, but must have been subse­

quently restored, since it is mentioned in the Itine­

rary (p. 12) as a Koman inunicipium. (Comp. Ptol.

/. c; Mela, i. 5; Scyiax, 51, 52.) According to

Shaw (Travels, p. 12), who, however, did not visit

the place, its ruins are still to be seen by the pre­

sent Tucumbrit; others identify it with the Artich-

kul of the Arabs, at the mouth of the Tafna, near

Rasgm. [T. H. I).]

SIGA (2rya, Ptol. iv. 2. § 2), a river of Mauri­

tania Caesariensis, fulling into a bay of the sea op­

posite to the island of Acra (now Caracolei).

Scyiax (p. 51) calls it Hyov. Probably the pre­

sent Tafna. [T. H. D.J

SIGE'UM (tiyttov or fj Sryeiai fixpa), a pro­

montory in Troas, forming the north-western ex­

tremity of Asia Minor, at the entrance of the

Hellespont, and opposite the town of Elaeus, in the

Thracian Chersonesus. Near it the naval camp of

the Greeks was said to have been formed during the

Trojan War. (Herod, v. 65, 94; Thucyd. viii. 101;

Strab. xiii. pp. 595, 603; Pomp. Mela, i. 18; Plin.

v. 33; Ptol. v. 2. § 3; Serv. ad Am. ii. 312.) This

promontory is now called YenUheri.

Near the promontory was situated the town of

Sigcum, which is said to have been an Aeolian

colony, founded under the guidance of Archueanax

of Mytilene, who used the stones of ancient

Troy in building this new place. But some year*

later the Athenians sent troops under Phrynon and

expelled the Mytileneans ; and this act of violence

led to a war between the two cities, which lusted for

a long time, and was conducted with varying success.

Pittacus, the wise Mytilenean, is said to have slain

Phrynon in single combat. The poet Alcaeus al,M>

was engaged in one of the actions. The dispu!e

was at length referred to Periander, of Corinth, who

decided in favour of the Athenians. (Strab. xiii.

p. 599; Herod, v. 95; Steph. B. ». e.; Diog. Lai'rt.

i. 74.) Henceforth we rind the Pisistratidae in

possession of Sigeum, and Hippias, after being ex­

pelled from Alliens, is known to have retired there

with his family. (Herod, v. 65). The town of

Sigentn was destroyed by the inhabitants of Ilium

soon ufler the overthrow of the Persian empire, so

that in Strata's lime it no longer existed. (Strab.

xiii. p. 600; Plin. v. 33.) A hill near Sigeum,

forming a part of the promontory, was believed in

antiquity to contain the remains of Achilles, which

was looked npon with such veneration that gradually

a small town seems to have risen around it, under

the name of Achillenm [ACHTtXHm]. This tomb,

which was visited by Alexander the Great, Julius
