SEGESVA. SEGOBRIGII.

Two other streams .ire mentioned by Aeliah (V. II.

ii. 33) in connection with Selesta, the Telme^sus ami

the Porpax; but we are wholly at a loss to determine

them. Some vestipes of the ancient walls may still be

traced; but almost the only ruins which remain

within the circuit of the ancient city are those of

the theatre. These have been lately cleared out,

and exhibit the praecinctio and sixteen rows of seats,

great part in good preservation. The general form

and arrangement are purely Greek; and the building

rests at the back on the steep rocky slope of the bill,

out of which a considerable part of it has been ex­

cavated. It is turned towards the X. and commands

a fine view of the broad bay of Caitell 'a More.

(For a more detailed account of the antiquities of

Segesta, see Swinburne's Travels, vol. ii. pp. 31 —

235; Smyth's Sicily, pp. 67, C>8; ami especially

Serra di Falco, Antichita del/a Sicilia, vol. i. pt. ii.)

Ancient writers mention 1 lie existence in the teiritory

of Segesta of thermal springs or waters, which seem

to have enjoyed considerable reputation (to. .depict

(JSara AfyeaTaia, Strab. vi. p. 275; Stpfia KovTpa

ra 'Eye'iraia, Diod. iv. 23). These are apparently

the sulphureous springs at a spot called Calavietti,

about a mile to the N. of the site of the ancient city.

(Kazell. Sic. vii. 4.) They are mentioned in the

Itinerary as "Aquae Segestanae sivc P'mcianac"

(Itin. Ant. p. HI); but the origin of the latter name

is wholly unknown.

The coins of Segesta have the figure of a dog on

the reverse, which evidently alludes to the fable of

tlio river-god Crimisus, the mythical parent of

Aeirestus, having assumed that form. (Serv. ad Aen.

i. 550, v. 30; Eckhel, vol. i. 234.) The older coins

(as already observed) uniformly write the name

2EPE2TA, as on the one annexed: those of later

date, which are of copper onlv, bear the leirend

ErE2TAinN (Eckhel, /. c. p. 236). [E. II. B]

COIN OF SEGESTA.

SEGESTA (Sestrt), a town on the coast of Li-

guria, mentioned by Pliny, in describing the coast of

that country from Genua to the Macru. (Plin. iii.

5. s. 7.) He calls it Segesta Tigulliorum; so that it

seems to have belonged to a tribe of the name of the

Tigullii, and a town named Tigullia is mentioned by

him just before. Selesta is commonly identified with

Sestri (called Sestri di Levante to distinguish it

from another place of the name), a considerable

town about 30 miles from Genoat while Tigullia is

probably represented by Tregoso, a village about 2

mile.-, further inland, where there are considerable

Roman remains. Some of the MSS. of Pliny, in­

deed, have " Tigulliaintus, et Selesta Tigulliorum,"

■uhieh would seem to jwint clearly to this position of

the two places. (Sillig, ad loc.) It is probable,

also, that the Tegulata of the Itineraries (/tin.

AM. p. 293) is identical with the Tigullia of

Pliny. [E. H.B.]

SEGESTA, or SEGESTICA. [Siscia.]

SEGIDA (267J5a, Strabo, iii. p. 162). 1. A
