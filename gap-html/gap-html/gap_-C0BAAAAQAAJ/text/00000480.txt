tain. It was probably but a small town, though

strongly fortified, whence Philistus (op. Steph, B.

a. f.) called it "a fortress of Sicily." It is con­

spicuously mentioned during the First Tunic War.

when it was in the hands of the Carthaginians, and

was besieged by the Romans, but for some time with­

out success, on account of the great strength of its

position; it was at length taken by the consul A.

Atitius Calatinus in u. c. 258. The inhabitants

were either put to the sword or sold as slaves, and

the town itself entirely destroyed. (Pol. i. 21;

Diod. xxiii. 1». Exc. Hoetch. p. 503; Zonar. riij.)

It was, however, again inhabited at a later period, as

we tiiid the Mutustratini mentioned by Pliny among

the municipal towns of the interior of Sicily. (Plin. iii.

8. s. 14.) But no notice of its name occurs in the

interval, and Cluveritu (who has been followed by

many modern geographers) would, therefore, identify

Mytistratus with Amestratus; an assumption for

whirh there are certainly no sufficient grounds, both

names being perfectly well attested, [Amkstka-

tcs.] (Cluver. Steal p. 383.) [E. H. B.]

MYUS(MvotJj: F.th. Mpowtms), an Ionian town

in Caria. on the southern bank of tlx* Maeander, at a

distance of 3U stadia from the mouth of that river.

Its foundation was ascribed to Cydrelus, a natural

son of Codrus, (.Strab. jut. p. 633.) It was the

smallest among the twelve Ionian cities, and in the

days of Strabo (xiv. p. 636) the population was so

reduced that they did not form a political commu­

nity, but became incorporated with Miletus, whither

in the end the Myusians transferred themselves,

abandoning their own town altogether. This last

event happened, according to Pausanias (vii. 2. § 7),

on account of the great Dumber of flies which an­

noyed the inhabitants; but it was more probablv on

account of the frequent inundations to which the

place was exposed. (V'itruv. iv. 1.) Myus was one

of the three towns given to Theinistocles by the

Persian king (Thucyd. i. 138; Diod. Sic. xi. 57;

Pint Them. 29; Athen. i. p. 29; Nep. Them. 10.)

During the Peloponnesian War the Athenians ex­

perienced a check near this place tVo:n the C'aiians.

(Thucyd. iii. 10.) Philip of Macedonia, who had

obtained possession of Myus, ceded it to the Mag-

nesians. Athen. iii. p. 78.) The only edifice

noticed by the ancients at Myus was a temple of

Dionysus, built of white marble. (Paus.LcJ) The

mmense quantity of deposits carried down by the

Maeander have considerably removed the coast-ltne.

■o that even in Strabo's time the distance between

Myus and the sea was increased to 40 stadia (xii.

p. 571*), while originally the town had no doubt

been built on the coast itself. There still are some

ruins of Myus, which most travellers, forgetting the

changes wrought by the Maeander, have mistaken

for those of Miletus, while those of Heracleia have

been mistaken for those of Myus. (Comp. Leake,

Asia Minor, p. 239, &c.) The mistake is repeated

by Sir C. Fellows (Journal of a Tour in As* Min.

p. 263), though it had been pointed out long before

his time. [L. S.]

NAARDA (Noapto, Ptot v. 18. § 7; Steph. B.

s.r.; NedpOa, Joseph. Ant xviii. 12), a small place

in Mesopotamia, near Sipphara. It is probably the

name as that called in the I'eutinger Table Naharra.

Josephus speaks (/. c.) of Nearda as a place in

Itabylonia, possessing an extensive range of territarr,

and defended from hostile attack by the Euphraisi,

which flows round it. When Tiberius ovtrtbiw

the Jews in tlie Kast, the remnant of that people

took refuge in Naarda and NUibis; ami th? firmer

city long remained a place of refuge for the Jews.

I In the intermediate records of the Christian East

we find occasional notices of this place, under tat

titles of Naliardeir and Bcth-Xuhadra. Thai, a
