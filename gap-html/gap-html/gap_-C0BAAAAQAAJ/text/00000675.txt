fx* tU aSims that Pharauia occupied the

site of Cerasus; and although he is copied in this

instance by the anonymous geographer, yet that

writer afterwards correctly places Cerasus 150 stadia

further east (p. 13). The error probably arose from

a confusion of the names Choerades and Cerasus;

but in consequence of this error, the name of Cera­

sus was in the middle ages transferred to Pharnaciu,

which hence still bears the name of Kerasunt or

Kerasonde. (Comp. Hamilton, Researches, i. pp.

250, 261, foil.; Cramer, Asia Minor, i. p. 281.)

Phamacia is also mentioned by Stephanus Byz.

(«. a), several times by Strabo (ii. p. 126, xi. p. 499,

xii. pp. 547, 549, 560, xiv. p. 677), and by Ptolemy

(v. 6. § 5). Respecting its coins, see Eckhel (Doctr.

Num. vol. iii. p. 357). Another town of the same

name in Phrygia is mentioned by Stephanus Byz.

(s. v.). [L. S.]

PHAROS (♦4>os, Ephorus, ap. Steph. B., Fr.

151 ; Scyl. p. 8; Scymn. p. 427; Diodor. xv. 13;

Strab. vii. p. 315), an island off the coast of 11-

lyricum, which was colonised by Greek settlers from

Paras, who, in the first instance, gave it the namo

of their own island, which was afterwards changed

to Pharos. In this settlement, which took place

B. c 385, they were assisted by the elder Dionysius.

When the Romans declared war against the lllyrians

B c. 229, Demetrius, a Greek of Pharos, betrayed

his mistress. Queen Teuta, for which he was re­

warded with the greater part of her dominions.

(Polyb. ii. 11.) The traitor, relying on his con­

nection witii the court of Macedon, set the Romans

at defiance; he soon brought the vengeance of the

republic upon himself and his native island, which

was taken by L. Aemilius in B.C. 219. (Polyb. iii.

16; Zonar. viii. 20.) Pliny (iii. 30) and Ptolemy

(ii. 17. § 14) speak of the island and city under

the same name, 1'hakia (<tapia), and Poly bins

(£ c.) says the latter was strongly fortified. The

city, the ancient capital, stood at Sturi Grad or

Citta Vecchia, to the N. of the island, where re­

mains of walls have been found, and coins with the

legend +AKinN. After the tail of the Roman

Empire the island continued for a long time in the

hands of the Narentinc pirates. Its Slavonic name

is Hvar, a corruption of Pharos; and in Italian it is

called Jsesina or Liesina. For coins of Pharos see

Eckhel, vol. ii. p. 160; Sestini, Monet. Vet. p. 42;

Mionnet, vol. ii. p. 46. (Wilkinson, iJalmaim, vol. i.

pp.243—251; Neigebaur, JJie Sud-Slaven, pp. 107

PHAROS (4>4>t, Strab. xviL p. 791, seq.; Steph.

B. s. v.: Eth. 4>djoioi), a long narrow strip of ruck

lying off the northern coast of Aegypt, having the

New Port of Alexandria E. and the Old Harbour SW.

[Alexamdreia, Vol. I. p. 97.] Its name is said

to have been derived from a certain pilot of Menelaus,

who, on bis return from the Trojan War, died there

from a serpent's bite. Pharos is mentioned in the

Odyssey (iv. 355). and is described as one day's sail

from Aegypt. This account has caused considerable

perplexity, since Pharos is actually rather less than a

mile from the seaboard of the Delta; and it is not

probable that the hind, in the course of centuries. h:u

advanced or the sea receded materially. It is per­

fectly intelligible, however, if we suppose the author

of the Odyssey to mean by Aegyptus, not the

country itself but its river, since the Phuros is even

now nearly a day's sail from the Canopic arm of

the Nile. Any other theory is untenable; tor this por­

tion of the coast of the Delta consists of rocky bars and
