era, Phanageria was taken by tbe neighbouring bar­

The most remarkable building in Phanagoria seema

to have been a temple of Aphrodite, sttmamed Apa-

tarns {*Avdrovpos), because the goddess, when at­

tacked by the giants in this place, is said to have

summoned Herculea to her aid, and then to have

concealed him and to have handed over the giauU

separately to him to be slain (&o\o$oviiy «'£ awarnT,

Strab. xi. p, 495; Steph. B. ». v. 'Airttrovpov;

Bockh, Inter. No. 2120.) We learn from an in­

scription that this temple was repaired by Saum-

mates, one of the kings of Bosporus. The site of

Phanagoria is now only a mass of bricks and pot­

tery; and there is no building above ground. One

cause of the disappearance of all the ancient monu­

ments at Phanagoria was the foundation in its

neighbourhood at an early period of tbe Russian

colony of Tmutarakan. Dutour noticed traces of

towers towards the eastern extremity of the town,

where the citadel probably stood. The town of 'in-

man contains several ancient remains, inscriptions,

fragments of columns, &c, which have been brought

from Phanagoria. There are numerous tombs abovo

tbe site of Plianagoria, but they have not been ex­

plored like those at Panticapaeum. In one of them,

however, which was opened towards the end of last

centnry there was found a bracelet of the purest

massive gold, representing the body of a serpent,

having two heads, which were studded with rubies

so as to imitate eyes and also ornamented with rows

of gems. It weighed three-quarters of a pound.

PHANAROKA (4>a>d>uia), a broad and exten­

sive valley in Pontus, watered by the rivers Iris,

Lycns, and Scylax, and endured between the chain

of Paryadres to the east, and Mounts Lithrus and

Ophlimus to the west. The soil there was the

best in Pontus, and yielded excellent wine and

oil and other produce in abundance. (Strab. ii. p.

73, xii. pp. 547, 556, 559; Plin. vi.4; PtoL v. 6.

§ 3, where it is erroneously called Phanagoria.)

Phanaroea contained the towns of Kupatoria, Cabira,

Polemoninm, and others. [Pontus.] [L. S.]

PHA'NOTE (FAh. ♦oewcr, Pol ), a strongly

fortified town of Chaonia in Epirus, and a place of

military importance. It stood on the site of the

modern Gardkiki, which is situated in the midst of

a valley surrounded by an amphitheatre of moun­

tains, through which there are only two narrow

passes. It lies about halfway between the sea and

the Antigonean passes, and was therefore of im­

portance to the Romans when they were advancing

trom Illyria in b. c. 169. (Lie. xiiii. 23; Pol.
