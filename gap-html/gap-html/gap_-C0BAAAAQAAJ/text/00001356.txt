1272 VENETIA. VENETIA.

(P. Dine. Eist. Lang. ii. 14). But in the later period

of the Roman Empire the Athesis seems to have

been generally recognised jis the W. boundary of

Venetia, though not so strictly ns to exclude Verona,

the greater part of which was situated on the right

bank of the river. Towards the N. the boundary

was equally indefinite: the valleys and southern

(dopes of the Alps were occupied by Rhaetian and

Euganean tribes; and it is probable that the limit

between these and the Veneti, on their S. frontier,

was always vague and arbitrary, or at least deter­

mined merely by nationality, not by any geographical

boundary, as is the case at the present day with the

German and Italian races in the same region.

Tims Tridentum, Feltria, and Belunnm, were all of

them properly Rhaetian towns (Plin. iii. 19. s. 23).

though included in the Tenth Region of Augustus,

and for that reason often considered as belonging to

Venetia.

On the E. the limits of Venetia were more definite.

The land of the Carni, who occupied the greater part

of the modern Frioul, was generally considered as

comprised within it, while the little river Eormio

(Risano), a few miles S. of Tergeste, separated it

from Istria. (Plin. iii. 18. s. 22.) Several authors,

however, regard Tergeste as an Istrian city [Ter-

gestk], and must therefore have placed the

boundary either at the Timavus, or where the Alps

come down so close to the sea, between that river

and Tergeste, as to prevent the road being continued

along the coast. There can be no doubt that this

point forms the natural boundary of Venetia on the

E., although the Formio continued under the Roman

Empire to constitute its political limit.

The physical peculiarities of the region thus

limited are very remarkable. The greater part of

Venetia is, like the neighbouring tract of Cisalpine

Gaul, a broad and level plain, extending, without in­

terruption, to the very foot of the Alps, and furrowed

by numerous streams, which descend from those

mountains with great rapidity and violence. These

streams, swollen by the melting of the Alpine snows,

or by the torrents of rain which descend upon the

mountains, as soon as they reach the plain spread

themselves over the country, forming broad beds of

sand and pebbles, or inundating the fertile tract on

each side of their banks. Continually stagnating

more and more, as they flow through an almost per­

fectly level tract, they form, before reaching the sea,

considerable sheets of water; and the action of the

tides (which is much more perceptible at the head

of the Adriatic than in any other part of that sea or

of the Mediterranean) combining to check the outflow

of their waters, causes the formation of extensive

salt-water lagunes, communicating with the sea

only through narrow gaps or openings in the long

line of sandy barriers that bounds thein. Such

lacunes, which occupy a great extent of ground S. of

the present mouth of the Po [Padi's], are con­

tinued on from its X. bank to the neighbourhood of

Altinum; and from thence, with some interruptions,

to the mouth of the Ison:o,M the head or inmost bight

of the Adriatic. So extensive were they in ancient

t imes that there was an uninterrupted line of inland

navigation by these lagunes, which were known as

the Sejitem Maria, from Ravenna to Altinum, a dis­

tance of above 80 miles. (Itin. Ant. p. 126.)

Great physical changes have naturally taken place

in tlhe course of ages in a country so constituted. On

the one hand there is a constant tendency to the filling

up of the lagunes with the silt and mud brought

down by the rivers, winch converts them zrt :i

marshes, and eventually into firm land. Oc u*

other hand the rivers, which have for ace* WaT-

fined within artificial banks, keep pashin- <a 'i*ff

mouths into the sea, and thus creating b*fkr*i---i

which give rise to fresh lagunes. At lbe sr t

time, the rivers thus confined, from tkm to t^-

break through their artificial barriers and feet* re*

channels for themselves; or it is futmd neefssa-TM

carry them off by new and artificial t-otlets. *i*s»

all the principal streams of Venetia. from ifc* Ad**

to the Piare. are at the present day carried u Ut

sea by artificial canals; and it U doubtful wbftar

any of them have now the same outlet as in ascii;

times.

In the eastern portion of Venetia. frcm the fl«

to the foot of the Alps near Aquileia. these rhy-*^*

characters are less marked. The coa&t is indeed or­

dered by a belt of marshes and 1 agones, bat ci zs

great extent: and within this, the rivers that de­

scend from the Alps have been for the nwi part

left to wander unrestrained through the plai£. is:

have in consequence formed for themselves br*

beds of stone and shingle, sometimes of scrpriaB*

extent, through which the streams in their gtiizm?*

condition roll their diminished waters, the trtaj

volume of which contrasts strangely with the br«a£i

and extent of their deposits. Such is the ei^racx

especially of the Tagliamente, the largest r-Tir c

this part of Italy, as well as of the TVrr. tat

Nathone, and other minor streams. The imf oiarr J

of their channels, resulting from this state of tiar*

is sufficiently shown by the fact tliat tlw riven

Turrus and Natiso, which formerly flawed under cat

walls of Aquileia, have now changed their cecw.

and join the Isonzo at a distance of more this 4

miles from that city. [Aqcilkia.]

Of the history of Venetia previous to tbe Earn

conquest we know almost nothing. It *e ocgs*s

j at that time by two principal nations, tlj« Ve5£7*

1 from whom it derived its name, in the \V„ aod tar

| Carni in the E-; the former extending frra ta*

: Athesis to the Plavis. or perhaps to the Tilsv^mr*^.

the latter from thence to the borders of Islria. &-*

I the origin and affinities of the Veneti themselraa an

extremely obscure. Ancient writers represent thee ■

! a very ancient people (Polyb. ii. IT), but at the

of whose origin and affinities we know ai»v<*Vy

nothing. [Kitgankl] Iri regard to the Veaali

themselves it cannot fail to be ieuiark»d thai »s

meet with three tribes or nations of tLss kith m

other parts of the world, besides tlxw of ltalv vx

the Gaulish tribe of lite Veneti on tbe et»>l of Ar>

tian or Slavonian tribe on the shores of th* Babf:

and the Heneti or Eneti, who are nwi wc a*

existing in Paphlaconia in the time of H«s^

(Iliad* ii. 85.) The name of this last peope aos

not subsequently appear in history, and wm aa

therefore wholly at a loss as to their elhioca] sa­

nities, but it is not improbable that it *aa ii*

resemblance or rather identity of their naae was

that of the Italian Veneti (according to tfce lira*

form of the latter) that gave nse to the tans*

story of Antenor having migrated to Veaatia
