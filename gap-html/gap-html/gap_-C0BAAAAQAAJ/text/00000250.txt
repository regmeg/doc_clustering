spoken of only under the name of Hcxaniilium

(*K£au.i'A;oi ; Symeon, Logoth. p. 408). The place

now occupying the place of Lysitnachia, Eetemil,

derives its name from the Justinianean fortress,

rous in the neighbouring village of Baular. f I.. S.]

COIN OF LYSIMACHIA IN THRACE.

LYSIMA'CHIA (Awri^ox'a: Eth. Avatnax**1*'.

Papadluites), a town of Ai'tolia. situated upon the

southern shore of the lake formerly called Hyria

or Hydra, and subsequently Lysitnachia, after this

town, [Respecting the lake, sec Aktoi.ia, p. 64, a.]

The town was probably founded by Arsinoe, and

named after her first husband Lysimachus, since we

know that she enbvged the neighbouring town of

Conope, and railed it Arsinoe after herself. [Co­

nope.] The position of the town is determined by

the statement of Stralio that it lay between l'leuron

and Conope, and by that of Livy, who places it on

the line of inarch from Naupactus and Calydon to

Stratus. Its site, therefore, corresponds to J'ajHid-

hates, where Leake discovered some Hellenic remains.

It was deserted in Strabo's time. (.Strab. p 400;

Pol. v. 7; Liv. xxxvi. 11 ; Steph. B. *. v.; Leake,

Northern Grtect, vol. i. pp. 122, 153.)

LYSIMELKIA. [Sybaci;sae.]

LYSIXOE (\vvtv6ri) or LYSISIA (Auo-iWo,

Ptol. v. 5. § 5). a small town in the north of Pisidia,

on the south of the Ascania Laous, and west of

Sagalassus. (1'olyb. Ere. de Leg 32; Liv. xxxviii.

15; Hicrocl. p. 680, who calls it Lyseuura,

Avtr^tvapa.) [L. S.]

LYSIS, a small river mentioned only by Livy

(xxxviii. 15), which had its sources near tin'town of

Lagos, in the west of PUalia. [L. S.]

LYSTRA (AtJ-rroa j&, or to), a town of Lyrao-

nia or Isauria. which is mentioned by Pliny (v. 42:

Eth. Lystreni) and Ptolemy (v. 4. § 12), and

repeatedly in the New Testament History. (Acts,

xiv. 8, 21; Timoth. iii. 11 ; comp. Hierocl. p. 67 j.)

A bishop of Lystra was present at the Council of

Chalcedon. Leake (Aria Minor, p. 102) is

inclined to place the town at Khatom Serai, about

30 miles south of Iconium; but Hamilton (/2e-

searrhis, vol. ii. p. 313), with more a(i]iearancc of

probability, identifies its site with the ruins of Kn-

adnt/h, which are generally believed to be the re­

mains of Derlw. [L. S.]

LYTARX1S, a promontory in Northern Europe,

mentioned by Pliny (vi. 12. s. 14). His text makes

the promontory of Lytamis, at one and the same

time, a portion of the Celtic country and the extre­

mity of the lUiipaean range — the Rhijiacan moun­

tains being the Vralian — " extra eos " (i e. the

N-ythians), " ultraipie Aquilonia initia Hyperboreos

aliqui posuerc, pluribus in Europe dictoa. Priinum

inde noacitur promontorium Celticae Lytamis, fla­

vins Caramburis, nbi huaau cum siderum vi Riphae-

onun mootium deficiunt juga." In the eyes of Uie

physical geographer, the extremity of the Vralian

chain is either the island of A'orxi Zembla or the

most northern portion of the district uu the west of

the sea of Obi,—the Obi being the Carambork. b

the usual maps, however, the Ihrina is the Carmn.-

bucis, and \anin Xoss, on the east of the White Sea,

the Lvtannis Prom. [R. G. L-]

LYTTUS. [Lyctus.]

MAACAH, BETH-MAACAH v. ABEL BETH-

MA ACAH (MoaXa, B»fluaax<i, AfliA ottou MooX« >.

a city of Palestine, placed by Eusebius and St. Je­

rome on the road between Eleutheropolis and Je­

rusalem, 8 miles from the former, the site of which

was then marked by a village named Mechanum. It

is clear, however, that the Abel Beth Maaeah of tbo

sacred writers could not have been situated so far

south. It is first mentioned in iSamuel, xx. 14.oV.,

as the city in which the rebel Sheba was besieged

by Joab. From this passage, however, it may be

gathered (1.) that Abel was not identical with

Belh-Maacah, for the copula is inserted between

the names ("unto Abel and unto Betli-Maacah");

(2.) that it was situated at the extremity of tl.e

land of Israel,for Joab " went through all the tribe*

of Israel" to come there. Abel then, which was, as

''the wise woman" called it, "a city and a mother

in Israel" (ver. 19), was so called from its u»d-

tignity to Beth-Maacah, (so Reland, Palaestina,

p. 519); and this must have been situated imw

the northern frontier, for it is mentioned with Ij-.u

and Dan, and Cinneroth and Naphthali (1 King: xv.

20), as one of the cities taken by Benhadad, king

of Syria, from Baasha, king of Israel; and two cen­

turies later it was one of the cities of Israel fir>t

occupied by Tiglath-Pileser, king of Assyria. (2

Kings, xv. 29.) Eusebius mentions three places

named Abel:—1. a village three miles from Phila­

delphia; 2. a city 12 miles east of (ladara: 3. an­

other between Paneas and Damascus. (Omomnsi.

s. r.) lMaml justly remarks (L c) that if any

one of these is to be taken as AM of Beth-Maarali

it must be the last-named; but that he is more dis­

posed to look for it in Galilee, to the west or south

of Paneas, rather than to the east or north, on iIms

Damascus road. This view is perhaps confirmed by

a comparison of 2 Chron. xvi. 4. with I King*, x»

20.; the Abel Beth Maaeah of the latter being

called AM Maim, or "Abel of the Waters" in to*

latter, probably so named eiilier from the era. of

Cinneroth or from the sea of Galilee. Dr. Robin* -n

suggests its identity with the modem village of

Abil, or lbel-el-Knml-h, or Alii or Ibel el /raira,

both situated in the Mrrj \lywn, which last nan*

is certainly identical with the ancient Ijan, with

which Abel Beth-Manrah is associated in 1 Kings,

xv. 20. (Robinson, Bib. Res. vol. iii. pp. 346, n. JL

347, n. 1., and Appendix, pp. 136, 137, n. 1.)

Maaeah is used as an adjunct to Syria or Aram

in 1 Chron. xix. 6, 7, but its situation is not de­

fined. (Reland, Palaestina. p. 118.)

The existence of the Maarathites (Max«*0 on

the east of Jordan, apparently between Bathan end

Mount Ilennon, contiguous to the Geshnntea

(/Am/, iii. 14; Josh, xii. 5, xiii. 11, 13) intimates

that another city or district of the name M uu ah

was situated in that quarter. [(■. W.]
