724 ROMA. ROMA.

cept in so far as they may serve to ascertain the era

of Rome. The account which has the most preten­

sions to accuracy is that given by Dionysius (i. G5,

7o, 71) and by Diodorus (Fr. lib. viii. vol. iv. p. 21,

Bipont). The sum of the reigns here given, allowing

Jive years for that of Aeneas, who died in the seventh

year after the taking of Troy, is 432 years —

that is, down to the .second year of Numitor, when

Koine was founded by Romulus, in the first year of

the 7lh Olympiad. Now this agrees very closely

with Varro's era for the foundation of Rome, viz.,

753 b. c. For Troy having been taken, according

to the era of Eratosthenes, in 118-t n. a, the differ­

ence between 1184 and 7.r)3 leaves 431 years for

the duration of the Alban kingdom.

Varro's date for the foundation of Rome is that

generally adopted. Other authorities place it rather

later: Cato. in 751 B.C.; Poly bins, in 750; Fabius

Pic tor, in 747.

This is not the place to enter into the question

whether these dates of the Alban kings were the

invention of a later age, in order to satisfy the re­

quirements of chronology. It will suffice to remark

that the next most prevalent opinion among those

Romans who adopted the main points of this tradition

assigned only three centuries to the Alban kings

before the foundation of Rome, This was the opinion

of Virgil (Am. i. 272),—

"Ilic jam terccntum totos regnabitur annos,"

— of Justin, of Trogus Pompeius (xliii. 1), and of

I,ivy (i. 29), who assigns a period of 4i>0 years

for the exigence of Alba, and places its destruction

a century after the foundation of Rome. At all

events the preponderance of testimony tends very

strongly to show that Rome was not founded till

several centuries after the Trojan AVar. Timaeus

wems to have been the first Greek writer who

adopted the account of the foundation of Rome by

Romulus. (Niebuhr, Hist. vol. i. p. 218.)

II. The City or Romulus.

The Roman historians almost unanimously relate

that Rome originally consisted of the city founded by

Romulus tin The Palatine. (Liv. i. 7; Veil. i. 8;

Tar. Ann. xii. 24; Dionys. i. 88; (Jell. xiii. 14; Ov.

TV. iii. 1. 29, &c.) The ancient settlement (if Evan-

der 'in the same hill, as well as a city on the Capi-

toline called Saturnia (Varr. L. L. v. § 42, Mull.;

FVhtus, p- 322, Mull.), and another on Mons Jani-

cutus called Aenea or Antipolis (Dionys. i. 73; Plin.

iii. 9). must he supposed to have disappeared at the

time lit its foundation, if indeed they had ever existed.

It seems probable enough, as Dionysius says, that

villages were previously scattered about on the

seven hills ; but the cxt>tence of a place called Vu-

tica or Vaticum, on the right bank of the Tiber, and

of a Quirium on the Quirinal, rests solely on the

conjecture of Jsiebuhr {Hist. vol. i. p. 223, seq.,

289, ^eq., Eng. Trans.)

Pomoerium.—Tacitus has given in the following

passage, the fullest, and most authentic account of the

circuit of the Romulean city: "Sed initium con-

dendi, et quod pomoerium Romulus posuerit, noscere

baud absurdum reor. Igitur a foro Boario, ubi

aereum tauri simulacrum adspicimns, quia id genus

animalium aratro subditur, sulcus designandi oppidi

coeptus, ut magnam llerculis aram amplecteretur.

Inde certis spatiis interject! lapides, per una inontis

l'alatini ad aram Consi, mox ad Curias Veteres,

Capitolium non a Romulo sed a Tito Tatio ji-'js
