1154 THEBAE BOEOTIAE. THEBAE BOEOTIAE

was the lower city (tj jcgitw ir6\ts), said to have

been added by Amphion and Zethns. (Paus. ix. 5.

2, 6.) The Cadmeia is again divided by a slight

depression near I lie foantain of I)irce and the Cre-

naean gate into two hills, of which the larger and

the higher one to the south was the aciopolis

proper, and was called the Cadmeia kolt ify>)ptPt

while the northern hill formed the agora of the

acropolis (tt/s aKpono\«as ayupd, Pans. ix. 12.

§ 3). The eastern half of the city was also divided

between the Strophia and the Lsmeuus into two parts,

of which the southern consisted of tlie hill Ismenius,

and the northern of several minor eminences, known

under the general name of Atnpheion. ('Afxpuov,

Arrian, Anab. i. 8.) Aeschylus describes the tomb

of Amphion as standing near the northern gate.

(Bo^atcus trvKais TvfiGov kot' avrbv Atoytvovs

'&fjL<p[ovos, Sept. c. Thtb. :")28.) llence Thebes con­

sisted of four parts, two belonging to the acropolis,

and two to the lower city, the former being the

acropolis proper and the agora of the acropolis, and

the latter being the hill [sinenius and the Ampheion.

Pausanias, leaving Potniae, entered Thebes on the

south by the gate Electrae, before which lie noticed

the Polyandriuin, or tomb of the Thebaus who fell

fighting against Alexander. (Pans. ix. 8. §§3.4, 7,

ix. 10. § 1.) The explanation of Forchhammer that

Alexander laid siege to the city on the south, and

that he did not return from the gate Electrae to

the Proetides, as Leake supposes, seems the must

probable. Accordingly the double lines of circum-

vallalion, which the Thebans erected against the

Macedonian garrison in the Cadmeia, must have

been to the south of the city around the chief gates

of the Cadmeia. (See Arrian, i. 7, 8.) Upon enter­

ing the city through the gate Electrae, Pausanias

notices the bill lsmemus sacred to Apollo, named

from the river Isinenus flowing by it (ix. 10. § 2).

ITpon the hill was a temple of Apollo, containing

several monuments enumerated by Pausanias. This

temple is likewise mentioned by Pindar and Hero­

dotus, both of whom sj>eak of the tripods situated in

its treasury. (Pind./ty/A. xi. 7,6eq.; Herod, v. 59.)

Above the Ismeniuin, Pausanias noticed the fountain

of the Isinenus, sacred to Ares, and guarded by a

dragon, the name of which fountain was Melia, as

we have already seen (ix. 10. § 5).

Next Pausanias, beginning again from the gate

Electrae, turns tu the left and enters the Cadmeia

(ix. 11. § I, seq.). He does not mention the acro-

polis by name, but it is evident from the list of the

monuments which he gives that lie was in tlie Cad­

meia. He enumerates tlie house of Amphitryon,

containing the bedchamber of Alcmena, said to have

been the work of Trophonius and Agamedes ; a mo­

nument of the children of Hercules l»y Megara; the

stone called Sophronister; the temple of Hercules

('Ht>a.K\ciov, Arrian, Anab. i. S); and. near it, a

gymnasium and stadium, both bearing the name of

this (iod; and above the Sophronister an altar of

Apollo Spodius.

Pausanias next came to the depression between the

acropolis and the agora of the Cadmeia, where he

noticed an altar and statue of Athena, bearing the

Phoenician surname of Onga ("Oyya), or Or.ca

("O-ytca) according to other authorities, and said to

have been dedicated by Cadmus (ix. 12. § 2). We

know from Aeschylus that there was originally a

temple of Athena Onca in this locality, which stood

outside the city near one of the gates, whence the

goddess was called ayx'nrroKu. Some derived the

■ name from a village named Onca or Oacse. i'.W:.
