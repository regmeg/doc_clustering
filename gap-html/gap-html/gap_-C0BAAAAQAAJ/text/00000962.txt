in nun tains. After passing Autidena it turns abruptly

to the ME., and pursues tliis course till it re-aches

the sea. In the lower part of its course it enters

the territory of the Frentani, which it traverses in

its whole breadth, flowing into the sea between Ilis-

toniam and Ortona. Strabo indeed represents it as

fanning the boundary between the Frentani and the

Peligni, but this is certainly a mistake, as the Pe-

Ugni did not in fact descend to the sea-coast at all,

and Ortona, one of the chief towns of the Frentani,

was situated to the N. of the Sagrns. (Strab. v.

p. 242; Ptol iii. 1. § 19; where the name is er­

roneously written Sapor.) The upper valley of the

Sagrns. with its adjoining mountains, waa the terri­

tory of the Samnitc tribe of the Caraceni. (Ptol.

iii. 1. § 06.) [E. H. It.]

SAUU'NTIA. 1. (Zayovvria, Ptol. ii. 4. § 13),

a town in the SW. part ot Hispania liaetiea. (Liv.

xxiiv. 12: Plin. iii. I. s. 3.) Now Xigotaa or

(Hyvtiza, N\V. from Medina Sidonia, where there

are many ruins. (Morales, Ant'ty. p. 87; Flora,

E$p, Sagr. x, p. 47.)

2. A town of the Arevaci, in Hispania Tarra-

conenMs, SW. from Itilbilis. It was in the juris­

diction of Clunia, on the road from E merit a to

CaesaraugUSta, and was the scene of a battle be­

tween Sertorius and Metellus. (Pint. Serf. 21;

App. Ii. i. 110.) 'I he name is written Segontia

in the /tin. Ant. pp. 4.1H ami 438. and in the (ieog.

Kav. hr. 43; hut must not be confounded with

that of a town of the CeJtiheri. Now Siguenza on the

SAGUNTUM {'S.iyovvrov, Ptol. ii. ti. § 59),

also called SAGUNTUS (Mela. ii. 6; Ziyovvros,

Steph. Ii. $, r.), a town of the Kdetani or Sedetani in

Hiapania Tanuconenais, seated on an eminence on

the banks of the river Pal hint ias, between Sucro

and Tarraco, and not far from the sea. Strabo

(iii. p. 159) erroneously places it near the mouth of

the Lbenia, though it lies near 100 miles to the

SW. of it. The same author states that it was

founded by Greeks from Zaeynthus; and we find

that Steplianui calls it Za*avOa and ZdtevvSos.

Livy adds that the founders were mixed with Ituttili

from Ardea (Liv, xxi. 7); whence we sometimes

find the city called Ausonia Saguntus. (Sil. Ital.

i. 332.) Another tradition ascribed its foundation

to Hercules, (lb. 263, 505.) Saguntum lay in a

very fertile district (l'olyb. xvii. 2), and attained to

great wealth by means of its commerce. It was

the immediate cause of the Second Punic War,

from its In-jug besieged by Hannibal when it wa>

in the alliance of the Romans* The siege is me­

morable in history. The town was taken, after

a desperate resistance, in ii. c 218, and all the

adult males put to the sword; but how long the

siege lasted is uncertain. (Liv. xxi. 14, 13 ; Cf.

Sil. Ital. i. 271, aeq.) Kiirht years afterwards

Saguntum was recovered by the Romans. The

Carthaginians bad partly destroyed it, and had used

it as a place for the custody of their hostages.

(Polvb. iii. 98; Liv. xxiv. 42.) The city was re­

stored by the Kotnans and made a Koman colony.

(Liv. x.wiii. 39; Plin. iii. 3. s. 4.) Snguntmn was

famous for its manufacture of earthenware cups

(calicos Saguntini) (Plin. xxxv. 12. s. 46; Mart,

iv. 4(>, xiv. 108), and the fiu's grown in the neigh­

bourhood were considered very fine. (Plin. xv. 18.

8. 19.) Its site is now occupied by the town of

Mwrviedro, which derives its name from the ancient

fortifications (muri veteres). But littW nowmioa
