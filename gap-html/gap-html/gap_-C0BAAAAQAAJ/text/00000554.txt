468 OKXOBARAS.

OEXOBAItAS (Oivogdpas or Oivoirdpas), a

river of the plain of Antioeu, in Syria, at which,

according to Stiabo (xvi. p. 751), Ptolemy Plu-

lometer, having conquered Alexander Balas in

battle, died of his wounds. It lias been identified

with ilie t'phrenus, modem Aphrcen, which, rising

in the roots of Amanus Mons (Almadayhy), runs

southward through the plain of Cyrrhestica, until

it tails into the small hike, which receives also the

Lahotaa and the Arceuthus, from which their

united waters run westward to join the Orontes

coming from the south. The Oenoparas is the

easternmost of the three streams. It is unques­

tionably the Afrin of AhuliVda. {Tabula Syr..

Supplementa, p. 152. ed. Koehler; Chesney, Ex-

peditirm, vol. i. pp. 407, 423.) [G. *\V.]

OE'NOE (OtVoTj). 1. A small town on the north­

west coast of the island of Icaria. (Strab. xiv. p.

639; Steph. B. s. v.; Athen. i. ]>. 30.) Thin town

was probably situated in the fertile plain below the

modern Me.ssaria. The name of the town seems to

be derived from the wine grown in its neighbour!mod

on the slopes of Mount Pramnus, though others

believe that the Icarian Oenoe was a colony of the

Attie town of the same name. (Comp. Ross, Reisen

avfden (Jriech. Inseln, ii. pp. 159, 162.)

2. A port-town on tiie eoast of Pontus, at the

mouth of the river Oenius, which still bears its

ancient name of Oenoe under the corrupt form I'nvh.

(Anian, Peripl. I\>nt. I'.iur. p. 16; Anonym. Peripl.

p. 11 ; comp. Hamilton, Researches, i. p. 271.)

3. An ancient name of the island of Sieinus.

'2. An Attic dermis n<':ir Eleutherae, upon the

Confines of Boeotia. [Vol. I. p. 329, No. 43.]

A fortress in the territory of Corinth. [Vol.1,

4. Or Okne (Ofrvj, Steph. B. $. r.), a small town

in the Argeia, west of Argos, on the left bank of

the river Charadrus, and on the southern (the Pri-

nus) of the two roads leading from Argo^ to Man-

tine i a. Above the town was the mountain Arte-

inisium (Malevos), with a temple of Artemis on the

fcuminit, woi^hijijjed by the inhabitants of Oenoe

under the name of Oenoatis (OiV&jaTis). The

town was named by Diomedes after his grandfather

Oeneus, who died here. In the neighbouring! of

this town the Athenians and Argives gained a vic­

tory over the Lacedaemonians. (Paus. ii. 15. § 2,

i. 15. § 1, x. 10. § 4; Apollod. i. 8. § 6; Steph. B.

f.r.) Leake originally placed Oenoe near tlie left

hank of the Charadrus; hut in his later work he

lias changed his opinion, and supposes it to have

stood near the right bank of the Inachus. His

original supposition, however, seems to be the cor­

rect one; since there can be little doubt that Ross

lias rightly described the course of the two roads

leading from Argos to Mantineia. (Leake, Morea,

vol. ii. p. 413, Pelopon. p. 206; Ross, Reisen im

Pelopoiittes, p. 133.)

5. Or Bokokoa, a town of Elis, near the Ho­

meric Ephyra. (Strab. viii. p. 338.) [Vol. I.

p. 839. b.]

OENOLADON (OiVrcAnoW, Stadiasm. § 96). a

river in the district of the African Syrtes, near the

town of AMARAEA (%Afiapa'ia, Stadiasm. I. c). where

there was a tower and a cove. Bartli ( Wandertmgen,

pp. 300, 359) refers it to the Wady Msid, where

there is a valley with a stream of sweet water in

OEXO'TRIA (pivurrpla), W3S the namedv«l

the Greeks in very early times to the southerns*

portion of Italy. That country was inhabited at t

i period when the Greeks first became acqsatrs

, with it, and becan to colonise its shores, by a t*^

whom they called Oenotri or Of.^otkii (Ojw*|

or Olfii^Tptui). Whether the appellation was a S

tional one, or was even known to the people tfc*

selves, we have no means of judging; but the Gn

writers mention several other tribes in the sa-~w p

of Italy, by the names of Chones, Morgetes, 1

Itali, all of whom they regarded as of the siJ-f n

with the Oenotrians; the two former being eirra

called Oenotrian tribes [Chores; MenGrn

while the name of Itali was, according to th* i

count generally received, applied to the fer.ini

in general. Antiochus of Syracuse dtstinctry sf

of the Oenotri and Itali as the same V*";'v (

, Strab. vi. p. 254), and defined the boathiarm

Oer.otria (under which name he included tb* ee

tries subse'iuently known as Lucania and Bmtt:

exchutire of Iapygia) as identical with ttr*«

Italia (ap. Strab. i c). A wcll-knowii tnJu:

adopted by Virgil, represented the Owtotrtaij

taking the name of Italians, from a chief or k r

the name of I talus (Dionys. i. 12, 35; \"irj. A*

533; Arist Pol vii. 10); but it seems -r*y>\

that tlii-. is only one of the mythical tales so cc:r

among the Greeks: and whether the name k?S

was only the native appellation of the peoptf' ■«

the Greeks called Oenotrians, or was on_ra

that of a particular tribe, like the Cbonr*

Morgetes, which was gradually extended to

whole nation, it seems certain that, in the dav

Antiothus, the names Oenotri and Itali, Oe

and Italia, were regarded as identical in rjtti

tion. The former names, however, bad nae

fallen into disuse; at least Herodotus empr.'W
