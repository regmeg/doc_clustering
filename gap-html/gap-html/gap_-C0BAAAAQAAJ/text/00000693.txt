from which cause, as well as from the action of the

currents already mentioned, both Tyre and Sidon

hare suffered changes which render them no longer

to be recognised from ancient descriptions. In some

places the coast has been depressed by earthquakes,

and at the mouth of the river Lycus are traces of

submerged quarries, (lierton, Tvpogr. de Tyr, p.

54.) In like manner, the lake Cenderia, at the

foot of Cannel, in which Pliny (v. 17) describes the

river Belus as rising, has now disappeared; though

Shaw (Trav. ii. 33) mentions some pools near its

source. The geological structure of Phoenicia is

recent, and consists of chalk and sandstone, the

higher mountains being formed of the Jura lime­

stone. The only metal found is iron, which occurs

in considerable quantities in the hills above Beirout.

In the sandstone of the same district, bituminous

wood and brown coal are found, but in small

quantities and impregnated with sulphur.

III. Ethnological Relations of the

Phoenicians.

The Phoenicians were called by the Greeks

Qolvutts (Horn. Od. iv. 84; Herod, i. 1; Thucyd.

L 8, &c), and by the Romans Phoenices (Cic. A. I'.

ii. 41 ; Mela, i. 18 f Plin. v. 13, &c). They were

a branch of the great Semitic or Aramaean race.

The Scriptures give no intimation that they were

not indigenous; and when the Hebrews settled in

Canaan, Sidon and Tyre were already flourishing

cities. {Josh. xix. 28, 29.) By classing, however,

the Phoenicians, ur Canaanites, among the descend­

ants of Ham (Genesis, x. 15), the Scriptures imply

an immigration. The reason of this classification,

was probably their colour, the darkness of their com­

plexion indicating a southern origin; yet their

Lwguage, a safer criterion, marks them, as we have

said, fur a Semitic race. This, though not strictly

identical with the Hebrew, was the nearest allied tc

it of all the Semitic tongues. St Jerome (Comm. in

Jer. xxv. 21) and St Augustine (Tract. 15 ia

Evang. Joan.) testify that the Punic language

resembled the Hebrew. The same affinity is ob­

servable in Punic words preserved in Greek and

Roman writers; as in the Voenulus of Plant us,

especially since the improvement of the text by the

collation of Mai. The similarity is also evinced by

bilingual inscriptions discovered at Athens, where

many Phoenicians were settled, as will be related in

the sequel. But perhaps one of the most re­

markable proofs is tlie inscription on the Cartha­

ginian tablet discovered at A/arseiHes in 1845. of

which 74 words, out of 94, occur in the Old

Testament.

Profane writers describe the Phoenicians as im­

migrants from the borders of the Persian Gulf.

Thus Herodotus (i. 1, vii. 89) asserts that they

originally dwelt on the Erythraean sea; an appella­

tion which, in his language, as well as in that of

other ancient writers, embraces not only the present

Red Sea, but also the Persian Gulf and lndiun

Ocean. To the same purpose is the testimony of

Stiabo (xvi. p. 766), who adds that there were in

the Persian Gulf two islands, Tyr us and Aradus,

the inhabitants of which had temples resembling

those of the Phoenicians, and who claimed the like-

named inlands on the coast of the Mediterranean as

their colonies. Heeren (Researches, vol. ii. p. 56,

Eng. trans.), who admits that traces of Phoenician

I workmanship and buildings have lately been dis-

| covered in these islands, reverses the parentngf, and
