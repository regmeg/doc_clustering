1123 TENTYRA.

TENTTRA.

tho name of the town, and is generally attached to

l lie bead-dress of Athor, accompanied by the sign

Kali or "the land." The Tentyrite Athor has a

human face with the ears of a cow (Rosellini,

Monum. dA. Culto, pi. 2\t. 3), and her attributes so

closely resemble those of Isis, that it was long

doubtful to which of the two goddesses the great

temple at Tentyra was dedicated. Like [sis, Athor

is delineated nursing a young child named Ehoott,

said, in hieroglyphics, to he her son. He is the

third member of the Tentyrite triad of deities.

The principal fabrics and produce of Tentyra

were flax and linen. (Pliu. xix. 1.) Its inhabit­

ants held lite crocodile in abhorrence, and engaged

in sanguinary conflicts with its worshippers, espe­

cially with those of the Ombite Nome [Umbos].

Juvenal appears to have witnessed one ot these com­

bats, in which the Ombites had the worst of it, and

one of them, falling in his flight, was torn to pieces

and devoured by the Tentyriles. Juvenal, indeed,

describes this tight as between the inhabitants of

contiguous nomes ("inter finitimos"); but this is

incorrect, since Umbos and Tentyra are more than 50

miles apart. As, however,Coptosand Tentyra were

nearly opposite to each oilier, and the crocodile was

worshipped by the Coptites also, we should probably

read Coptos tor Umbos in Juvenal. {Sot. xv.) The

latter were so expert in the chase of this animal in

it;, native element, that they were wont to follow it

into the Nile, and drag it to shore. (Aelian, Bust.

Anini. x. 24; l'lhi. viii. 25. s. 38.) Seneca (Aut.

Qwitsl. it. 2) says that it was their presence of mind

that gave the Tentyrites the advantage over the cro­

codile, for the men themselves were small sinewy

fellows. Strabo (xvii. pp. 814, 815) saw at Hume

the exhibition of a combat between the crocodile and

men purposely imported from Tentyra. They plunged

boldly into the tanks, and, entangling the crocodiles ill

nets, haled thein backwards and forwards in and out

of the water, to the gieat amazement, of the be­

holders.

So long as Aegypt was comparatively unexplored,

no ruins attracted inure admiration from travellers

than those of Tentyra. They are the first in

tolerable preservation and of conspicuous magnitude

that meet the eyes of those who ascend the Nile.

They are remote from the highways anil habitations

of men, standing at the hurt of the Libyan bills,

amid the sands of the western desert. But though

long regarded as works uf a remote era, Aegyptian

art was already on the decline when the temples of

Tentyra were erected. The architecture, indeed,

reflects the grandeur of earlier periods; but the

sculptures are ungraceful, and the hieroglyphics un­

skilfully crowded ujwiii its monuments. The must

ancient of the inscriptions do not go farther back

than the reigns of the later Ptolemies; but the

names of the Caesars, from Tiberius to Antoninus

Mi us (a. i). 14—161), are of frequent occurrence.

Tentyra, in common with Upper Aegypt generally,

appears to have profited by the peace and security it

enjoyed under the imperial government to enlarge or

restore its monuments, which, since the Persian oc­

cupation of the country, had mostly fallen into de­

lay. 'The principal structures at Tentyra are the

great temple dedicated to Athor; a temple of Isis;

a Typhonium; and an isolated building without a

roof, of which the object has not been discovered.

With the exception of the latter, these structures are

inclosed by a crude brick wall, forming a square,

each side of which occupies lUOU feet, and which is

I in some parts 35 feet hieh and 15 feet thick. Fa'
