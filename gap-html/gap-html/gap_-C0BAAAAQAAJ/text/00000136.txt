the Lsmian war. Having afterwards received sue- j

conrs from Craterus, Antipater retreated northwards, I

and defeated the allies at the battle of Crannon in

the following year. (Dind. xviii. 9, seq.; Polyb. is. J

29.) In B. c. 208 I'hilip, son of Demetrius, de-'

feated the Aetolians near Lamia. (Liv. xwii. 30.)

In 192 Lamia opened its Rates to Antiochus (Liv. .

xxxv. 43), and was in consequence besieged in the

following year by I'hilip, who was then acting in |

conjunction with the Romans. (Liv. xxxvi. 25.) On

this occasion Livy mentions the difficulty which the

Macedonians experienced in mining the rock, which

was siliceous (" in asperis locis silcx saepe impene-

trabilis ferrooccurrebat"). In 190 the town was taken

by the Romans. (Liv. xxxvii. 4, 5.) Lamia is men- i

tioned by Pliny (iv. 7. s. 14), and was also in

existence in the sixth century. (Hierocl. p. 642, ed.

Wesseling.) The site of Lamia is fixed at Zittmi,

both by the description of the ancient writers of the

position of Lamia, and by an inscription which Paul

Lncas copied at this place. Zittmi is situated on a

hill, and is by nature a strongly fortified position.

The only remains of the ancient city which Leake

discovered were some pieces of the walls of the

Acropolis, forming a part of those of the modern

castle, and some small remains of the town walls at

the foot of the hill, beyond the extreme modern

houses to the eastward. On the oppmitc side of the

town Leake noticed a small river, which, we learn

from Strabo (ix. p. 434. 450), was called Achelous.

The port of Malia was named Phai.ara (t& 4-o>

Aopa, Strab. ix. p. 435; Polyb. xx. 11; Liv. xxvii.

30, xxxv. 43; Plin. iv. 7. s. 12), now StijUdha.

Zittmi has been compared to Athens, with its old

castle, or acropolis, above, and its Peiraecus at Sttj-

Utlha, on the shore below. Thin- is a tine view from

LAMIACUS SINUS (a Aauioxoi hoa™), a

name ixiven by Pausanixs to the Maliac gulf, from

the important town of Lamia. (Pans. i. 4. § 3, vii.

15. § 2, x. 1. § 2.) In the same way the gulf is

now called Zitiini, which is the modem name of

Lamij.

LAMI'NIUM (Aa^fi'iov: F.lh. LaminiUni: near

FvrnUann, between itontiel and Alcaraz), a town

of the Carpetani (according to Ptolemy, though

some suppose it to have belonged rather to the

Oretani), in Hispania Tarraconensis. It was a sti­

pendiary town of the conventus of New Carthage,

ami stood on the high road from Kmerita to Caesar-

augusta. The river Anas (Gmdiana) rose in the

lands of I-aminitim, 7 M. P. K. of the town. (Plin.

LAMPAS (Aofiirili), a harbour on the K. cnatt

of the Tauric Chersonese, 800 stadia from The<!'.-.: i,

and 220 stadia from Criu-Metopon. (Arrian, PeripL

p. 20; Anon. Peripl. p. 6.) Arrian use* the two

names Lampas and Halmitis as if they bel<Ti:'e.l to

the same place, but the Anonymous Coast-de»criher

speaks of Lampas alone. Halmitis probably took

its name from being a place for salting fiah. The

Trass, of which no particulars are known, except

that it was annexed to Persia hy the satrap Olanes

in the reign of Darius Hystaspis. It is mentioned

only by tho earliest writers. (Herod, v. 26; Strab.

LA'MPSACLS (Aduifaxsi: Elk. Aaufsunpvt).

sometimes also called Lampsacum (Cie. us Vvrr. i.

24; Pomp. Mela, i. 19), was one of the moat cde-

brated Greek settlements in Mysia on the Hrlle*pjir;t.

It was known to have existed under the nams of

Pityusa or Pityuasa before it received colonist* from

the Ionian cities of Phocaca and Miletux (Strab.

xiii. p. 589; Steph. B. s. c; Plin. v. 40; Horn. IL

ii. 829; Plut. de VirL MuL 18.) It was situated,

opposite to Callipolis, in the Thrscian Cher*ooe»o»,

and possessed an excellent harbour. Herodottu (vi.

37) relates that the elder Miltiailes, who was settled

in the Thracian C'hersoncsus, made war upon the

Lampsaeeni. but that they took him by surprise,

and made him their prisoner. Being thrrateerd,

however, by Croesus, who supported Miltiade*. they

set him free. During the Ionian revolt, the town

fell into the hands of the Persians. (Hens), v. 117.)

Tho territory abont Lampsacos produced cxerJlmt

wine, whence the king of Persia bestowed it npon

Themistocles, that he might thence provide hinweif

Diod. xi. 57; Plut Them. 29; Nepos, /"Aram. 10;

Amm. Marc- xxit. 8.) But even while Lampsacus
