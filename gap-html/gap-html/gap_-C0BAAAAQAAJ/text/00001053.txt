-am Giditatram (Plin. v. 1. a. 1; Solin. c. 28;  
ak. xrii. p. 827.) One of these mountains, now

ad the Ape Mountains (Graberg Von HemsB,

fire of Morocco, Germ. Tr. p. 24), bore, ac­

tor; to Strata (t c.) the name of the Elephant

*►*■'), probably from the number of elephants  
■h wen to be found there. (Plin. l.c.: Mart,

iri. p.J16.) The Geogr. Itav. (iii. II) also

Imos in this neighbourhood a town called Septem

'.rr>. which is perhaps the same place mentioned

b> Itia Ant. (p. 9) as a station between Tingis

Awrle. Procopiua also (B. I'and. i. 1; comp.

i, and dv Aed. vi. 7) mentions here a castle

ar*»s called Jiwror: and Isidore {Orig. xv.

i eutle and town called Septa, perhaps the

>ra Cetsta. (Comp. Mek, i. 5. § 5, et ibi

rswke.) [T. H. D.]

EPTBM MARIA ('EttA TtXiyn), was the

p cwmnonly given to the extensive lagunes at

w«rth of the Padus, and the adjoining rivers,

*tiirh extend along a considerable part of the  
v of the Adriatic fro:n the mouth* of the Padus

iJtisom. Pliny indeed seems to use the term in

restricted sense, as he speaks of "Atri-

«u parade*, quae Septeni Maria appcllantur"

It a. 30); but the Itinerary distinctly applies

■aw to the whole extent of the lagunes from

ne to Altirrnm (/im. Ant. p. 126); and Hero-

"fco notices them particularly (viii. 7), clearly

tii" term in the same sense. [E. II. B.]

UTEM PAGI ('Ewto nd-yoi), was the name

i to a district close to Rome, but on the right

«f the Tiber, which according to tradition had

formed part of the territory of the Veientes,

n rnded by them to the Romans as early as the

o< Romulus. (Dionys. ii. 55; Plut Rom. 25.)

tt; to the authorities followed by Dionysius

• again surrendered to the Etruscans by the

'deluded1 with Porscna, but was shortly after

ri by that monarch to the Romans. (Dionys.

Vj.) Lirr mentions the same circumstances,

tftaut giving the name of the district. (Liv.

15.) It is evident, however, that this was a

i»rwD appellation, but we are unable to fix its

aries more definitelr. [E.H. B.]

rTETIPEDA (2ewr<>r«Sa, Strab., Ptol: Eth.

■ ■ fiar.us: San Screrino), a town of Picenum,

Lptvr vmlley of the Potentia, 9 miles above

It is mentioned by all the geographers, and

rcrr Sepiempedann* " is noticed in the Liber

•ram. (Plin. iii. 13. b. 18; Strab. v. p. 241;

ii 1. § 5S; LA. Col. p. 258.) Pliny assigns

rank of a municipal town, and this is confirmed

t,;<j jiis, one of which is of the age of Aurelian.

(Orell. Inter. 1026; Grnter, Inter, p. 308.3.) It is

placed by the Itinerary of Antoninus on that branch

of the Klaminian Way which, quitting the main high

road at Nuceria, crossed the Apennines to Prolaqneutn

and thence descended the valley of the Potentia by

Septempeda and Treia to Auximum and Ancona.

(/tin. Ant. p. 312.) It early became an episcopal

see, and derives its modern name of San Severiuo

from one of its bishops who flourished in the middle

ages. It still retains its rank as an episcopal city,

and is the capital of the surrounding city, though it

has not more than 3000 inhabitants. (Rampoldi,

Ditinn. Corogr. vol. iii. p. 837.) [E. H. B.]

SEPTIMANCA, a town of the Vaccaei in His-

pania Tarraconensis (/tin. Ant. p. 435). Now Si-

nanau. [T. H. D.]

SEPULCHRUM EURIPIDIS (Atnm. Marc,

xxvii. 4. §8; comp. Gell. xv. 20; Piut. Lycurg.

36; Vitruv. viii. 3; Plin. xxxi. 19; /tin. Ilierosol.),

the remarkable monument erected to Euripides in

Macedonia, at the narrow gorge of Aulon or Arc*

thusa (Besikia or Rnmili Bogkazi), where the

mountains close upon the road. The ancients

(Vitruvius, /. c; Plin. /. c.) placed it at the con­

fluence of two streams, of wliich the water of one

was poisonous, the other so sweet and health-giving

that travellers were wont to halt and take their

meals by its currents. In the Jerusalem Itinerary,

a document as lute as the 13th century, it occurs

as a stution between Pennana and Apollonia. (Comp.

Clarke's TrareU, vol. viii. pp. 9—13.) [E. B. J.]

SE'QUANA (SnKovdvai, SnuodVas, Ptol. ii. 8.

§ 2), the Seine, one of the large rivers of Gallia.

The Seine rises in the highlands south of Langres,

but in the department of Cote a"0r, and ffows in a

northwest direction past Chatillon-sur-Stine, Troyes,

Melun, Paris, Mantes, Elboeuf, Rouen, and Le

Havre. It enters the Atlantic below Le Havre.

The course of the Seine is about 470 miles, and the

area of its basin is about 26.000 English square

miles, which is only one half of the area of the basin

of tlte Loire. The chief branches of the Seine which

join it on the right bank are the Aube, the Marne,

and the Oise; on the left bank, the i'vnne, the Loing,

and the Eure. None of the hills which bound the

basin of the Seine, or are contained within it, have a

great elevation, and a large part of the country

included within this basin is level.

Caesar (B. 67. i. 1) makes the Sequana and the

Matrona (J/nrne) the boundary between the Celtae

and the Belgac. .Strata (iv. p. 192) says that tho

Sequana rises in the Alps, a statement which we

must not altogether impute to an erroneous notion

of the position of the river's source, though his

knowledge of Gallia was in many respects inaccurate,

but to the fact that he extended the name of Alps

far beyond the proper limits of those mountains.

But his inaccuracy is proved by his saying that tta

Sequana flows parallel to the Rhine, and through tho

country of the Sequani. He is more correct in fixing

its outlet in the country of the Caleti and the

Lexovii. The Seine was navigated in the time of

Strata and much earlier. [Galua Trassaltixa,

Vol. I.]

The Mtttrjna, as Ausonius names it (Mosclla,

v. 462),—

"Matrona non Gallos Belgasque intersita fines,' —

joins the Seine a few miles above Paris; it is the

largest of the affluents of the Seine.
