SYRASTRE'NE {Xvpairrpnrh, Peripl. M. E. c.

41; PtoL vii. 1. § 2), a district of ancient India,

near and about the mouths of the Indus. There

can be no doubt that it is represented by the modern

Saurashtrdn, for a long time the seat of a powerful

nation. Surashtra means in Sanscrit u the beautiful

kingdom." Ptolemy (I. c.) mentions a small village

Syraatra, which may have once been its capital. It

is probable that the Syrieni of Pliny (vi. 20. s. 23)

were inhabitants of the same district. [V*.]

SYKGIS (Sipyis, Herod, iv. 123), a consider­

able river of European Sarmatia, which flowed from

the country of the Thyssagetae through the terri­

tory of the Maeotuc, and discharged itself into the

Palus Maeotis. Modern geographers, have variously

attempted to identify it. Keuncll (Geogr. of JJerod.

p. 90) considers it to be one of the tributaries of the

Wolga. Gatterer (Comment. Soc. Gott. xiv. p. 36)

takes it to be the Donetz, whilst Reichard identities

it with the Jrgitz, and Linder (Scythien, p. 66)

with the Don itself. [T. H. D.]

SV'KIA (2upia: Eth. 2voio*), the classical name

for the country whose ancient native appellation was

Aram, its modern Esh-Sham.

I. Name.—The name Aram (D^S), more com­

prehensive than the limits of Syria Proper, extends,

with hevpral qualifying adjuncts, over Mesopotamia

and Chaldaea. Thus we read (1.) of Aram of the

two rivers, or Aram Naharaim (D^lII DTt?, LXX.

tt)c MetroTorafilav, Gen. xxiv. 10), equivalent to

Pailan-Aram, or the Plain of Aram

LXX. T7/y MerrojruTo^iat Zvpias, Gen. xxv. 20,

xxviii. 2, 5, 6, 7, xxxi. 18), but comprehended also

a mountain district called "the mountains of the

east" (Num. xxii. 5, xxiii. 7; JJeuL xxiii. 4).

(2.) Aram Sobah (rp'lS D^J?, LXX. SouM,

1 Sam. xiv. 47; 2 Sam. viii. 3,' x. 6, 8). (3.)

Aram of Damascus (pJJ^?;! LXX. 2up(o

AauatjKiw, 2 Sam. viii. 5). (4.) Aram Beth-Rehob

(3irrrjva d^. lxx 'Poii«, 2 Sam. x. 6,8).

(5.) Aram Maacih (H^JJO, LXX. MoaXa, 1

Chron. xix. 6). Of these fivo districts thus dis­

tinguished, the first has no connection with this

article. With regard to the second, fourth, and fifth,

it is doubtful whether Sobah and Rehob were in Meso­

potamia or in Syria Proper. Gesenius supposes the

empire of Sobah to have been situated north-cast of

Damascus ; but places the town, which he identifies

with Ncsebin, Nisibis, and Antiochia Mygdoniae,

in Mesopotamia (Lex. s. m. D^K and l,ut

a comparison of 2 Sam. x. 6 with 1 Chron. xix. 6

seems rather to imply that Rehob was in Meso­

potamia, Soba and Moacha in Syria Proper; for, in
