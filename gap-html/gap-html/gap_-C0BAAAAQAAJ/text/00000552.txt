the situation of Galaxidhi. The Oeanthians

(OiwAeis) are mentioned anions the Locri Ozolae

by Thucydidw (hi. 101). Scylax calls the town |

Euanthis: and since Strabo says (vi. p. 259) that

Loeri Kpij.cphyrii in Italy was founded by the Eocri

Ozolae, andcr a leader named Euanthes, it has been

conjectured that Oeantheia or Euantheia was the

place where the emigrants embarked. Oeantheia

ap(>e:trs to have been the only maritime city in

I.oeris remaining in the time of Pausanias, with the

exception of Naupactus. The only objects at Oean­

theia mentioned by Pausanias wvrc a temple of

Aphrodite, and one of Artemis, situated in a grove

above the town (x. 38. § 9). The town is men­

tioned in the Tab. Peut as situated *20 miles from

Naupactus and 15 from Anticyra. The remains of

antiquity at Calarhlhi are very few. There are

pome ruins of Hellenic walls; and an inscription of

no importance bos been discovered there. (Bockh,

/truer. No. 1764.) The modern town is inhabited i

by an active seafaring population, who possessed 1

180 ships when Ulricha visited the place in 1837.

Oiairirw, Ptol. ii. 6. $ 10), erroneously written Olarso

by Pliny (iii. 3. s. 4, iv. 20. s. 34), wan a maritime

town of the Vascones in liispania Tarraconensis,

near the promontory of the same name, and on the

river Magrada (Mela, iii. 1). most probably Oyarcn

or Oyarznn, near /run and Fuentenrabta. In an

Inscr. we rind it written Ocas una. (Grut. p. 718;

OECHA'LIA (Oi\a\la\ Eih. Ol\a\itvi), the

name of several ancient towns in Greece. 1. In

Me>senia, in the plain of Stenyelerus. It was in

ruins in the time of Epaminondas (Pans. iv. 26.

§6). and its position was a matter of dispute in later

times. Strabo identified it with Andania, the an­

cient residence of the Messeniau kings (viii. pp. 339,

350,360, x. p. 448), and Pausanias with Carnasium,

which was only 8 stadia distant from Andania, and

upon the river Charadros. (Pans. iv. 2. §2, iv. 33.

§4.) Carnasium, in the time of I'ausanias, was the

name given to a prove of cypresses, in which were

statues of Apollo Carneius, of Hermes Criophorus,

and of Persephone. It was here that the mystic

rites of the great goddesses were celebrated, and that

the urn was preserved containing the bones of Eu-

rytns. the son of Melaneus. (Paus. iv, 33. §§ 4, 5.)

2. In Euboea, in the district of Eietria. (Ilecat

ap. I'aus. iv. 2. § 3; Sopb. Track. 74; Strab. Ix.

p. 438, x. p. 448; Steph. B. s. r.)

3. In Thessaly, on the I'eueius, between Pel'mna

to the east and Tricca to the west, not far from

Ithome. (Strab. viii. pp. 339. 350, ix. p. 433, x.

p. 448; Pans. iv. 2. § 3; Steph. II. *. v.)

4. In the territory of Trachis. (Strab. viii. p. 339,

s. p. 448; Steph. B. s. r.)

5. In Aetolia. (Strab. x. p. 448.) Each of these

cities was considered by the respective inhabitants as

the residence of the celebrated Eurytus, who was

conquered by Hercules, and the capture of whose city

wxs the subject of an epic poem called Oi'x<*Afas

a\wots, which was ascribed to Homer or Cresphy-

lns. Hence among the early poets there was a dif-

fcrence of statement upon the subject. The M»v

senian Oechalia was called the city of Euryici it

the Iliad (ii. 596) mid the Odyssey (xxi. 13). eat

this statement was followed by Pherecydt* (ap.Seiti

ad Soph. Track. 354) and Pausanias (iv. i JJ)-

The Euboean city was selected by the writer of tie

poem on the Capture of Oechalia (Schol ap. Sefk

I. r ), by Hecataeus (ap. Pan*. L e.), and by Mrtfct

(x. p. 448). The The*salian city is mentioned as tat

resilience of Eurytus in another passage of the Ua4

(ii. 730); and K. 0. Muller supposes that thaw*

the city of the original table. (Durians, vol.: - 4>s
