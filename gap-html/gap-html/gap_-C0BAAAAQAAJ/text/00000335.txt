MEGAKIS. 317 MELAENEAE.

begins to descend, we must place the Molurian rock

(jj MeAovp(s), from which Ino or Leucothea threw

herself with her son Melicertes (Palaemon) into the

tea: and close by were the execrable rocks (ivaytW),

from which Sciron used to throw strangers into the

Ka, and from which lie was himself hurled by The­

seus. (Pans, i. 44. § 7, seq.) The tortoise at the

foot of the rock, which was said to devour the rob­

bers, was probably a rock called by this name from

Us shape, and which gave rise to the tale (Kara -H)?

KaXevpiyriv xfAcvrnv, Diod. iv. 59). On the sum­

mit of the mountain was a temple of Zeus Aphesins.

On descending into the plain was the temple of

Apollo Latous, near which were the boundaries of

Ifararis and the Corinthia. (Paus. i. 44. §§ 9, 10.)

Megaris contained only one town of importance,

Mxoara, with its harbour Nisaea, which have

been already described. The other towns in the

country were Akgosthena and Pegae (Doric

I'agab), on the Alcyonian or Corinthian gulf; Tri-

roumcus and Rhus, in the interior; Piiibalis, on

the confines of Attica (Schol. ad Aristoph. Acharn.

802); and Piialycon and Poliohne, of which

the site is uncertain. There was also a fortress,

Gkkaheia, situated on one of the mountains of this

same, but its position is also uncertain (Scylax,

p. 15; Plin. iv. 7. s. 11); it is apparently the same

place as the Ekeseia ('Ep«'«ia) of Pausanias (i. 44.

§ 5). Scylax mentions a place Aris, but instead of

Ut--,"3i. tuxos Tcpeu'cia, 'Apis, it has been conjee-

tared that we ought to read UttyaX t«ixos< r*po-

r«a ixptt or axpa. Whether there was a place of

the name of Isus in Megaris seems doubtful.

MEGARTS. [Mec.ara.]

ME'GARIS, a small island on the coast of Cam-

puiU, mentioned by Pliny (iii. 6. s. 12), who places

it between Pausilypos and Neapolis; it can therefore

bt do other than the islet or rock now occupied by

the Cattel dell Oro. [Neapolis.] It is evidently

the same which is called by Statius Megalia. (Stat.

Sic ii. 2. 80.) [E. H. B.]

MF.G1DDO. [Leoio; Magdolum.]

MEGIDDO VALL1S, the western part of the

1st plain of Esdraelon, at the northern foot of

Moist Carmel, watered by the Kishon. [Es-

m:« uix Valus v. Campus.] [G. W.]

MEGISTE (Mtylimi), an island off the coast of

LTcia, opposite to Antiphellus. It contained a town

■aieh, if the reading in Strabo (xiv. p. 666) be

afreet, was called Cisthene (Kiof^nj), but had

pBiahed before the time of Pliny (v. 35). There

«m also an excellent harbour, which appears to

hats been capable of containing a whole fleet. (Liv

mrii. 22; comp. Steph. B. «. v., who calls the town

Meziste; Ptnl. v. 3. § 9; Scylax, p. 39.) The island,

*Qlcd dented its name from the fact that it is the  
htfrest of a group, is now called Kasteloryzo, or

'-'■"Iff liauo. The island seems to have been colo­

nised by the Rhodians, or at least to have been in

their possession, for inscriptions found there aro

composed in the Doric dialect. There are but few

remains of ancient buildings. (Leake, Asia Minor,

p. 184; Fellows, Lgcia, pp. 187, &c.) [L. S.]

MEGISTUS. [Macestus.]

MEIACARIRE (Amin. Marc, xviii. 6, 10;

yiaiajcaptpt, Theophyl. Simoc. i. 13, ed. Bonn), a

small place in Mesopotamia, mentioned by Ammianus

and Theophylact. It appears to have been at no

great distance from Amida. Ammianus 6tates that

it derived its name from certain cold springs which

were there. (Cf. Booking, Notit. DigniU i. p.

418.) [V.]

MEILICHUS. [Achaia, p. 13, b.]

MELA or MELLA, a river of Gallia Transpa-

dana, still called the Mella, which rises in the

Alps, flows through the Val Trompia, anciently

the residence of the Triumpilini, enters the plain of

Lombardy near Brixia, and falls into the Ollius

(Oglio) more than 20 miles below that city. Ca­

tullus speaks of it as flowing through the city of

Brixia, but this is an inaccuracy or a poetical

license, as it passes, in fact, about a mile to the

W. of it. [Brixia.] Both he and Virgil describe

it as a placid and winding stream. (Catull. lxvii.

33; Virg. G. iv. 278 ; Philargyr. ad he.) [E.H.B.]

MELAE. 1. A town of the Samnites, mentiom d

only by Livy (xxiv. 20), among the towns of the

Caudine Samnites which were taken by Fabins in

B.C. 214. The same author elsewhere (xxvii. 1)

mentions a town of the Samnites which he calls

Meles, and which was not taken till b. c. 210, by

Marcellus. Nevertheless, it is probable that the

same place is meant in both cases, but we have no

clue to its position.

2. A town in the neighbourhood of Locri in Brut-

tium, mentioned by Thucydides (v. 5), but other­

wise wholly unknown. [Locri.] [E. H. B.]

MELAENA (MeAawa). 1. A promontory of

Ionia, forming the north-western point of the penin­

sula which is traversed by Mount Mimas. It was

celebrated in ancient times for its quarries of mill­

stones. (Strab. xiv. p. 645.) It is possible that

this promontory, which is now called Kara-Burun

(the Black Cape), may be the same as the one called

by Pliny (v. 31) Corynaeum Promontorium, from

the town of Coryne, situated at the southern ex­

tremity of Mount Mimas

2. A promontory of Bithynia, on the right hand

on sailing through the Bosporus into the Euxine,

between the rivers Rheba and Artane. (Apollon.

Rliod. ii. 651; Orph. Argon. 716; Arrian, Peripl.

p. 13; Marcian, p. 69.) In the anonymous Periplus

of the Euxine (p. 2), it is called KaWlvaKpov, and

Ptolemy (v. 1. § 5) calls it simply BiOwfas tutpov.

Its modern name is Tihili.

3. The north-western promontory of the island of

Chios (Strab. xiv. p. 645), now called Cape 5.

MELAENAE. [Attica, p. 329, b.]

MELAENEAE or MELAENAE (MtAaircal.

Paus.; MeAcm-ai. Khun. ap. Steph. B. ». v.: l-'.tli

MeAaiKus), a town of Arcadia, in the territory ol

Heraea, and on the road from Hemes to Megalopolis.

It was distant 40 stadia from Buphagium. Pau­

sanias says that it was founded by Melaeneus, the

son of Lycaon, but that it was deserted in his time

and overflowed with water. The ruins of Melaeneae

lie 4 or 5 miles eastward of Heraea, between the

villages Kokora and Kakoreot, where are the re­
