the river Rhubon, identical, according to Ukert ("iii.

who dwelt on the Oder. [T. II. D.]

VEMA'NIA, a town of Vindelicia, on the road be­

tween Augusta Vindelicorum and Brigantium (It.A at.

pp. 237, 251, 250; Tab. Pettt.), seems to have been a

place of some importance, us it was tlie station of the

prefect of the third legion, who had to guard t he frontier

from this town toCainpodunum. (ATof. Imp.) I'he place

now occupying the site is called W'awjen. [L. S.]

VEXAFKUM (Ovtvatypov: Eth. Veu;tfrar.us:

Venafro), an inland city of Campania, si mated

n the upper valley of the Vultnmus. and on the Via

Latina, 16 miles from Casinum and 18 from Teanum,

{Jtin. Ant. p. 303.) It was the last city of Cam­

pania towards the N., its territory adjoining on the

W., that of Casinum (5. Germano), which was in­

cluded in Latiuni, in the more extended sense of that

name, and that of Aescrnia on the NE., which formed

part of Samnium. It sto^d on a hill rising above

the valley of the Vulturnus, at a short distance from

the right bank of that river. (Strab. v. p. 238.)

No mention is found in history of Venafrum before

the Itoinan conquest of this part of Italy, and it is

uncertain to what people it originally belonged ■ but

it is probable that it bad fallen into the bands of the

Samnites before that people came into collision with

Rome. Under the Roman government it appears as

a flourishing municipal town: Cato, the most ancient

author by whom it is mentioned, notices it as having

manufactures of spades, tiles, and ropes (Cato, R. R.

135) : at a later period it was more noted for its

oil, which was celebrated as the best in Italy, and

supplied the choicest tables of the great at Rome

under the Empire. (Hor. Carvi. ii. fj. 16, Sat. ii.

4. 69; Juv. v. S6; Martial, xiii. 98; Strab. v. pp. 238,

242; Varr. R. U. i. 2. § 6; Plin. xv. 2. s. 3.)

The only occasion on which Venafrum figures in

history is during the Social War. B. c. 88, when it

was betrayed into the hands of the Saumite leader

Marius Egnatius. and two Roman cohorts that formed

the garrison were put to the sword. (Appian, B. C.

i. 41.) Cicero more than once alludes to the great

fertility of its territory (Cic. de Jsg. Agr. ii. 25,

pro Plane. 9), which was one of those that the tri­

bune Rtillus proposed by his agrarian law to divide

among the Roman citizens. This project proved

abortive, but a colony was planted at Venafrum

under Augustus, and the city continued henceforth

to bear the title of a Colonia, which is found both in

riiny and in inscriptions. (Plin. iii. 5. s. 9; Lib.

Col. p. 239; Zumpt, de Colon, p. 34"; Mommsen.

J user. A*, y. 4043,4703.) These last, which are very

numerous, sufficiently atte.it the flourishing condition

of Venafrum under the Roman Empire: it continued

to subsist throughout the middle ages, and is still a

t-wn of about 4000 inhabitants. It retains the an­

cient site as well as name, but has few vestiges of

antiquity, except the inscriptions above mentioned

and some shapeless fragments of an edifice supposed

to have been an amphitheatre. The inscriptions

are published by Mommsen. (Itiscr. R. A', pp.

243—249.) [E. H. B.]
