about 20 feet in height. At the head of a narrow

glen, which leads to the principal pate, stand the

ruins of the temple of Nemesis upon a large arti­

ficial platform, supported by a wall of pure white

marble. But we find upon this platform, which

funned the rtptvos or sacred enclosure, the remains

of ttro temples, which are almost contiguous, and

nearly though not quite parallel to each other. The

larger building was a peripteral hexastyle, 71 feet

long and .'l.'i broad, with 12 columns on the side,

and with a pronaus, cella, and posticum in the

usual manner. The smaller temple was 31 feet

lung by 21 feet broad, and consisted only of a cella,

with a portico containing two Doric columns i»

ant is. Among the ruins of the larger temple are

some fragments of a colossal statue, corresponding

in size with that of the Kbamnusian Nemesis; but

these fragments were made of Attic, marble, and not

of Parian stone as stated by Pausanias. It is, how­

ever, not improbable, as Leake has remarked, that

the story of the block of stone brought by the Per­

sians was a vulvar fable, or an invention of the

priests of Nemesia by which Pausanias was deceived.

Among the ruins of the smaller temple was found

a fragment, wanting the head and shoulders, of a

statue of the human si/.e in the archaic style of the

Aeginetan school. This statue is now in the liritish

Museum. Judging from this statue, as well as

from the diminutive size and ruder architecture of

the smaller temple, the latter apjtfars to have been

the more ancient of the two. Hence it has been

inferred that the smaller temple was anterior to the

Persian War, and was destroyed by the Persians

just before the battle of .Marathon; and that the

larger temple was erected in honour of the goddess,

who had taken vengeance upon the insolence of the

barbarians for outraging her worship. In front of

the smaller temple are two chairs (^»oVoi) of white

marble, upon one of which is the inscription Nfjuctrej

'S.uaTparot avtdrjutv, and upon the other 06,ui5<

^.wrrrparos avf07}KfV, which has led some to suppose

that the smaller temple was dedicated to Themis.

Hut it is more probable that both temples were dedi­

cated to Xemcsis, and that the smaller temple was

ii! ruins before the larger was erected. A difficulty,

however, arises about the time of the destruction of

the smaller temple, from the. fact that the forms of

the letters and the long vowels in the inscriptions

upon the chairs clearly show that those inscriptions

belong to aii era 1 >ng subsequent to the battle of

Marathon. Wordsworth considers it ridiculous to

suppose that these chairs were dedicated in this temple

after its destruction, and hence conjectures that the

temple was destroyed towards the close of the Pelo-

ponne>ian War by t he Persian allies of Sparta,

of the IVriplus, the most distant station of the

Arabian trade with Aegypt, Aethiopia, and the

The name is derived from the peculiar boats in use

there. These are termed by the natives dows

(ilau), and, like tbe modern boats of Foia «i
