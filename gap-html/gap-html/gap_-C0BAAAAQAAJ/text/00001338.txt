ing the Savua not far from the town of Basante

(Plin. iii. 28, whore some read Valdanus or Va-

dasus); its modern name is Bosna. [L. S.]

VALE'NTIA (Eth. Valentinus: Nwagus), a

town in the interior of Sardinia, HE. of Usellis. It

seems to have been a considerable place, as the

Valentini are one of the few names which Pliny

thought it worth while to mention among the

Sardinian towns. Ptolemy also notices the Valen­

tin! among the tribes or " populi " of the island, and

there can be little doubt that the Valeria of the

sum: author is only a false reading for Valentia.

(Plin. iii. 12. s. 17; Ptol. iii. 3. 6, 7.) Its

remains are still visible at a village called Nitragus,

near the town of Irili, about 12 miles from the

ruins of Usellis. The adjoining district is still

called Parte Vahnza. (De la Marmora, Voy. en

Sardatgne, vol. ii. p. 407.) [E.H.B.]

VALE'NTIA, the later name of a Roman province

in the S. part of Britannia Barbara, or of the country

lying N. of the Picts' wall, as far as Graham* t Dike,

including Northumberland, Dumfries, &c. This

district was wrested from the Picts and Scots in

the time of Valentinian, and formed by Theodosius

into a Roman province, but it remained only a short

time in the possession of the Romans. (Amniian.

Marc xxviii. 3; Not. Imp.) [T. H. D-]

VALE'NTIA (OuaAeirtci, Ptol. ii. 6. § 62), a

considerable town of the Edetani in Hispania Tar-

raconensis, situated on the river Turiu'u, at a dis­

tance of 3 miles from its mouth, and on the road

from Carthago Nova to Castillo. (Plin. iii. 3. s. 4;

Vib. Seq. p. 18; Itin. Ant. p. 400.) Ptolemy

(/.(*.) erroneously attributes it to the Contestant

It became at a later period a Roman colony (Plin.

/. c), in which apparently the consul Junius Bru­

tus settled the soldiers ofViriathus. (Liv. KpiL

Iv.) Pompey destroyed it. (Epitt. Pomp. ap.

Stdhtst, ed. Corte, p. 965; cf. Plut. Pomp. 18.) It

must, however, have been restored soon afterwards,

since Mela mentions it as being still an important

place (ii. (}), and coins of it. of u late period are pre­

served. (Cf. Florez, Med. ii. p. 610, iii. p. 125;

Mionnet, i. p. 55. Suppl. i. p. 110; Sestini, p. 209;

Eckhel, i p. 60.) The town still bears the same name,

but has few antiquities to show. [T. II. I).]

VALE'NTIA (OitaAti'Ti'a). in Gallia Nurbonensis,

a colonia in the territory of the Cavari, as Pliny says

( iii. 4): but D'Anville proposes to alter the mean­

ing of this passage of Pliny by placing a full stop

between "Cavarum" and "Valentia." However,

Valentia {Valence) was not in the country of the

Cavari, but in the territory of the Segallauni, as

Ptolemy (ii. 10. § 12) says, who calls it " colonia."

Valence is a town on the east bank of the Rhone,

a few miles below the junction of the here. In the

middle ages it was the capital of the Valentinois,

and in the fifteenth century it became the seat of a

university. [G. L.]
