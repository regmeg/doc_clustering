052 SELEUCEIA. SEGUSTERO.

357.) Of Segusio as a municipal town we hear

little; but it is mentioned as such both by Pliny and

Ptolemy, and its continued existence is proved by

inscriptions as well as the Itineraries; and we learn

that it continued to be a considerable town, and

a military post of importance, as commanding the

passes of the Alps, until long after the fall of the

Western Empire. (Plin. iii. 17. s. 21; Ptol. hi- 1.

§ 40; Grnter, Inscr. p. 111. 1; Orell. Imcr. 1690,

3803; Amm. Mare. xv. 10; Itin. Hier. p. 556;

P. Diac. Hist. Lang. iii. 8; Ore?. Tur. iv. 39.)

AmmUnus tells us that the tomb of Cottiua was

still visible at Segusio in his time, and was the object

of much honour and veneration among the inhabitants

(Amm. /. c). A triumphal arch erected by him in

honour of Augustus is still extant at Stisa; it enu­

merates the names of the "Civitates " which were

subject to his rule, and which were fourteen in num­

ber, lhough Pliny si>eaks of the " Cottianae civitates

xii." (Plin. iii. 20. t>. 24; Orell. /;wcv. 626.) All

these are, however, mere obscure mountain tribes,

and the names of most of them entirely unknown.

His dominions extended, according to Strabo, across

the mountains as far as Ebrodunum in the land of

the Caturiges (Strab. iv. p. 179); and this is con­

firmed by the inscription which enumerates the Ca­

turiges and Medulli among the tribes subject to his

authority. Tiieje are probably the two omitted by

Pliny. CK'elum, in the valley of the Chisone, was

comprised in the territory of Cottius, while its limit

towards the Taurini was marked by the station Ad

Fines, placed by the Itineraries on the road to Au­

gusta Taurinorum. But the distances given in tlie

Itineraries are incorrect, and at variance with one

another. Ad Fines may probably be placed at or near

Ariy/iarui, 15 miles from Turin, and 20 from Susa.

The mountain tribes called by Pliny the "Cottianae

civitates,'* when united with 1 lie Human government,

at first received only the Latin franchise (Plin. /. c);

hut as Segusio became a Roman municipium, it must

have received the full franchise. [E. II. B.]

SEGUSTEKO, a name which occurs in the Anto-

nine Itin. and in the Table, is a town of Gallia Nar-

bonensis. any! the name is preserved in Sisteron, the

chief town of an arrondtssement in the department of

Basse* Alp*:*, on the right hank of the Durance.

Roman remains have been found at Sisteron. The

name in the Notit. Prov. Galliae is Civitas Segeste-

riorum. It was afterwards called Segesteriuui, and

Sistericum, whence the modern name comes. (U'An-

ville, Xotice.tfc.) [G. L.]

SEIR, M. (Srjtlp, EXX. 2tt€ipa,

Joseph). "The land of Seir" is equivalent to " the

country of Edom." ((/eft. XXX.il. 3.) Mount Seir was

the dwelling of Esau and his posterity (xxxvi. 8, 9;

Deut.W. 4,5), in the possession of which they were not

to he disturbed. {Josh. xxiv. 4.) Its general situ­

ation is defined in Deuteronomy (i. 2) between

Horeb and Kadesh Barnea. The district must have

been extensive, for in their retrograde movement

from Kadesh, which was in Seir (i. 44), the Israel-

iles compassed Mount Seir many days (ii. 1. 3). The

original inhabitants of Mount Seir were the Horims;

''but the children of Esau succeeded them, when

they had destroyed them from before them, and

dwelt in their stead" (ii. 12, 22; com p. Gen.

xiv. 6). It obviously derived its name from " Seir

the Horite" (xxxvi. 20, 21). and not, as Jasephus

erroneously supposes, from the Hebrew "VJJC' = hir-

sulus. {Ant. i. 20. § 3.) The range bordering Wadtj

Araba is marked M. Shehr in some modern maps,

i but without sufficient authority for the ion*. Ih

Wilson conhnes the name to the eastern s.4f d

Araba, from a little north of Petra lo u*

of Afaibah, which range he names Jtbtl-tfiSierak

(Lands of the Bible, vol. i. pp. 289.2yo, ^37. Mv<

but since Kadesh was in Sen", itisobvwus that tia

on both sides the Araba. Mr. Rowland* tea-.,

name Es-S<rr given to an elevated plain Vo tiw tax

of Kadesh, which must, he thinks, be the Sfitf ai.ifa.~j
