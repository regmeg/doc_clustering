NEAE PATRAE. [Hypata.]

NEAETHUS (N/aiflor, Strab. j N^oiflov,

Theocr.; NawuSot, Lycophr), a river on the E.

coast of Bruttium, falling into the gulf of Ta-

rentum about 10 miles N. of Crotona, still called

the A'leto or Neto. Strabo derives its name from

the circumstance that it was here that the Trojan

women who were conducted as captives by a Greek

fleet, set fire to the ships of the victors, and thus

compelled them to settle in this part of Italy. (Strab.

vi. p. 262; Flin. iii. 11. s. 15.) It is well known that

the same legend is transferred by other writers to

many different localities, and appears to have been

one of those which gradually travelled along the

coast of Italy, in the same manner as the myths

relating to Aeneas. The form of the name Nowutot

employed by Lycophron (AUx. 921) points evi­

dently to the same fanciful derivation (from vavs

and atdta). Theocritus alludes to the rich and va­

ried herbage which grew on its banks (Id. iv. 24),

and for which, according to a modem traveller, it

is still remarkable. (Swinburne, Travels, vol. i. p.

313.) [E. H. 15.]

NEANDREIA, KEA'NDRIUM, NKANDRUS

(NfdvSpeia, NtavSpiuv. NiavZpos: Eih. NtavSptvt

or NeavSoievs), a town in Troas, probably founded hy

Aeolians; in the time of Strabo it had disappeared,

its inhabitants, together with those of other neigh­

bouring places, having removed to Alexandreia.

(Strab. xiii. pp. 604, 606.) According to Scylax

(p. 36) and Stephanus Byz. (>. r.), Neandreia was

a maritime town on the Hellespont ; and Strabo

might perhaps be supposed to be mistaken in

placing it in the interior above Hamaxitus ; but he

is so explicit in his description, marking its dis­

tance from New Ilium at 130 stadia, that it is

scarcely possible to conceive him to be in the wrong.

Hence Leake (.Isia Minor, p. 274), adopting him

as his guide, seeks the site of Neandreia in the

lower valley of the Scaiuander, near the modem town

of Ene. [L. 6.]

NEANDRIA. [Nka.]

NEANISSUS (Ntarurois or Novfo-ffift), a town

in Armenia Minor, on the south, cast of Phreata, and

between this latter town and Diocaesareia. (Ptol. v.

6. § 14.) No further particulars are known about

the place. [L. S.]

NEA'POLIS, i. e. " the New City." L /■ Eu­

rope. 1. (NediroAn: Elk. NeaToAmjr, Strab.

and Steph. B.; but coins bare N<o*oAfrn>, Neapo­

litans: Jfapoli; in French and English Naples),

one of the most considerable cities of Campania,

situated on the northern shore of the gulf called the

Crater or Sinus Cumanus, which now derives from

it the name of Bay of Naples. All ancient writers

agree in representing it as a Greek city, and a

colony of the neighbouring Cumac; but the circum­

stances of its foundation are very obscurely related.

Scymnus Chius tells us it was founded in pursuance

of an oracle; and Strabo calls it a Cumaean colony,

but adds that it subsequently received an additional

body of Chalcidic and Athenian colonists, with some

of the settlers from the neighbouring islands of the

Pithecusae, and was on this account called Neapolis,

or the New City. (Strab. v. p. 246; Srymn. Ch. 253;

Veil Pat. i. 4.) Its Chalcidic or Euboean origin is

repeatedly alluded to by Statius, who was himself a

native of the city (Silt. i. 2.263, ii. 2. 94, iii. 5.12);

but these expressions probably refer to its being a

I colony from the Chalcidic city of Cumae. The name

I itself sufficiently points to the fact that it was
