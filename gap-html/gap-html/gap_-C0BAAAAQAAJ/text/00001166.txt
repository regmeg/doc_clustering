1030 SYlilAE POMAE. SYKTICA KEGIO.

In the year 632, Syria was invaded by the Sara­

cens, nominally under t lie command of Abu Obeidah,

one of the " companions M ot" Mahomet, but really

lt'tl by C haled, ** the sword of God." The easy

conquest of Bosra inspirited the Moslems to attack

I>:iina,scus; but here the resistance was more deter­

mine!, and, though invested in 633, the city was

not captured till the following year. Heraclius had

been able to collect a large force, which, however,

under the command of his general Werdan, waa

completely defeated at the battle of Aisnadin; and

Damascna, after that decisive engagement, though

it still held out for seventy days, was compelled to

yield. Heliopolis and Eincsa speedily shared the

fate of Uusra and Damascus. The last efforts of

I If radius in defence of Syria, though of extraor­

dinary magiutode, were frustrated by the battle of

the Vennuk. Jerusalem, Aleppo, and Damascus

successively yielded to the Saracen arms, and Hc-

raclios abandoned a province which he could no

longer hope to retain. Thus in six campaigns

(633 — 639) Syria was entirely wrested from the

Roman empire. (Gibbon, Decline ami Fall, ch.

51 ; Marquardt, Ram. AllertJi. vol. iii.) [T. H. D.]

SYRIAE PORTAE (Ivptat vlAou). a pass be­

tween Mount Amanus and the coast of the bay of

Issus, which formed a p:issa£e from Cilicia into

Syria. It was 3 stadia in length, and only broad

enough to allow an army to pass in columns.

(Xenoph. Awrb. i. 4. § 4: Arrian, A nab. ii. 8;

Plin. v. 18; Ptol. v. 15. § 12; Strab. xiv. p. 676.)

This mountain pass had formerly been closed up at

both ends by walls leading from the rooks into the

sea ; but in the time of Alexander they seem to

have existed no longer, as tltey are not mentioned

by any of his historians. Through the midst of

this pass, which is now called the pass of BcMan,

under the name of Merkez su, its ancient name being

SYIilAS (Supiov), a headland in the Kuxine,

on the coast of Pnphlagonia, which, to distinguish it

from the larger promontory of Caiambis in its vi-

cinity, was also called &npa Aewrfr (Mercian, p. 72;

Arrian, PeripL P. J?.p. 15; Anonym. PeriplP.E.

not 2vpioi), an island in the Aegaean sea, one of

the Cyclades, tying between Rheneia and Cythnus,

and 211 miles in circumference, according to Pome

ancient authorities. (Plin. iv. 12. s. 22.) Syros

produces pood wine, but is upon the whole not fer­

tile, and does not deserve the praises bestowed upon

it by Homer (/. c), who describes it as rich in pas­

tures, cattle, wine, and wheat. It is usually stated

upon the authority of Pliny (xxxiii. 12. s. 56) that

Syros produced Sil or yellow ochre; but in SilHg's

edition of Pliny, Scyros is substituted for Syros.

Syros had two cities even in the time of Homer

(OtL xv. 412), one on the eastern, and the other on

the western side of the island. The one on the

eastern side, which was called Syros (I'M. iii. 15.

§ 3d), stood on the same site as the modern capital

of the island, w hich is now one of the mat f
