that Lycia enjoyed its highest degree of prosperity,

ft»f under the protection of Koine the people had suf-

firicnt leisure to attend to their own internal affairs.

By a strict and wise neutrality, they escaped the

dangers of the Mithridatic Wars as well as those of

the wars against the pirates. (Appian, Mithrid

24, 61 ; Strab. xvi. p. 665.) The prosperity of

Lycia, however, received a severe blow during the

war of Brutus and Cassius, who attacked the country

because it was susjjected to favour the party of

Octavianus and Antony. When Brutus advanced

against Xanthus, the inliahit.inls razed the suburbs

to the ground, and offered the most determinate re­

sistance. After a long and desperate siege, the

soldiers of Brutus gained admission by treachery,

whereupon the Xanthians made away with them­

selves by setting tire to their city. The fall of

Xanthus was followed by the surrender of Patara

and the whole Lycian nation. Brutus levied enor­

mous contributions, and in some instances ordered

the inhabitants to give up all their gold and silver.

(Appian, B, C. iv. 60, 65, 75, &c.) Antony after­

wards grunted the Lycians exemption from taxes, in

consideration of their sufferings, and exhorted them

to rebuild the city of Xanthus. (Ibid. v. 7 ; comp.

Dion Cass, xlvii. 34.) But after this time the

prosperity of Lycia was pone, and internal dissen­

sions in the end also deprived the inhabitants of

their ancient and free constitution; for the emperor

Claudius made the country a Roman province,

forming part of the prefecture of Pamphylia. (Won

Cass. lx. 17; Suet. Claud. 25.) Pliny (v. 28)

states that Lycia once contained seventy towns,

but that in his time their number was reduced to

twenty-six. Ptolemy (v. 3), indeed, describes Ly­

cia as a separate province; but it is probable that

until the time of Theodosius II. it remained united

with Pamphylia, for an inscription (Grater, T/tesaur.

p. 458. 6) mentions Portias as "procos. Lyciae et

Pamphyliae," and both countries had only one

governor as late as the reign of Constantine. But

Theodosius constituted Lycia a separate province;

and so it also appears in the seventh century in

literacies (p. 682. &c.), with Myra for its capital.

LY'COA (Aokoo: Eth. AuKodrns), a town of

Arcadia in the district Maenalia, at the foot of Ml

Macnalus, with a temple of Artemis Lycoaita. It

was in ruins in the time of Pausanias, and b repre­

sented by the Paleohtstron between Arachtxa and

Korteroli. (Paus. viii. 3. § 4,36. § 7; citepta. B. *. r.;

ifc. p. 171: Boss, Reistn an Pthponnes. p. 120; Cur-

tius, Pttojxmnesos, vol. i. p. 358.) There was another

Lycoa not far from the Alpheius, near its junctka

with the Lusius or Gortynius, at the foot ot Ml Lt-

cacus. (Pol. xvi. 17.) It has been conjectured that

the proper name of the latter of these town* waa

Lycaea, since Pausanias (viii. 27. § 4) speaks of

the Lycaeatae (AvKotarcu) as a people in the district

of Cynuria, and Stephanus mentions a town Lycaea

(At'Kcua). (lA'ake, Morta, vol. ii. p. 304.)

the western bank of the Nile. The shield of a

king named Itccamai, who reigned in Upper Egypt,

probably during the shepherd dynasty in the bower

Country, has been discovered here, (ttoscllini, Mom.

Civ. i. 81.) Lycopolis has no remarkable ruin*,

but in the excavated chambers of the adjacent rat k«

are found mummies of wolves, continuing the

origin of its name, as well as a tradition preserved by

Diodorus (ii. 88; comp. Aelian. Hist. An. x. T9\

to the effect that an Aethiopian army, invading

Aegypt, was rejjelled beyond the city of Elephantine

by herds of wolves. Osiris was worshipped und»r

the symbol of a wolf at Lyco]«Iis: he luring, ac­

cording to a myth, come from the hhadea under that

form, to aid Isis and Moms in their combat with

Typhon. (Champollitm, lJescritti.de TEgyptc, toL i.

xvii. p. 802; Steph. H. s. r.)f was an incon-iderall»

town in the Scbennytic nome, in the neigh buurbod

of Mendes, and, from its appellation, apparently

founded by a colony of Osirian priests from I'pper

Egypt. The Deltaic Lycopolis was the berth place
