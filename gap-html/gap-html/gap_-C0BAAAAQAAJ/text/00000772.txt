could never have been a large town, and appears

under the Romans to liave sunk into comparative

insignificance. It is indeed noticed by Livy, together

with Fregenae and Castrum Novum, as one of tile

maritime colonies which in B. c. 191 contended in

vain for exemption from military levies (Liv. xxxvi.

3); but we have no account of the time at which

the colony was established there, nor does any sub­

sequent mention of it occur in that capacity. Its

name is mentioned by all the geographers among

the towns on the coast of Etruriaj but Strain) terms

it only a small town (iroAtx*'")*'), and Servius calls

it in his time merely a fort (castellum), which

would agree well with the character of the remains.

(Strab. v. p. 225; Wei. ii. 4; I'lin. iii. 5. s. 1; I'tol.

ill. 1. § +: Martial, xii. 2; Serv. adAen. I.e.) But

in the time of Kutilins it had altogether sunk into

decay, and its site was occupied only by a large

villa. (Rutil. J tin. i. 223.) No subsequent notice

of it is found until it reappears in the middle ages

under the title of .SVi»f<; Severa.

The Itineraries vary much in the distances they

assign between Pyrgi and the other stations on the

coast; but they agree in placing it between Alsium

and Castrum Novum: and this circumstance,

coupled with the distance of 50 stadia from Caere,

given by Strabo, leaves no doubt that it is correctly

identified with Sta Severn. (Strab. v. p. 220; I tin.

Ant. pp. 290. 301; Itin. Mnrit. p. 498; Tab. Peat.)

The site of the fortress of that name is unquestion­

ably that of an ancient city. The walls of the

present castle, which is of mediaeval date, are based

on foundations of very ancient character, being con­

structed of polygonal blocks of stone of large size,

neatly fitted together without cement, in the same-

manner as the walls of Cosa and Saturnia. The line

of these foundations, which are undoubtedly those of

the walls of the ancient city, may be traced through­

out their whole exteid. enclosing a quadrangular space

of alxmt half a mile in circuit, abutting on the sea.

Some remains of Roman walls of later date occur at

the extremities on the sea-coast; hut no remains

have been found of the celebrated temple which

was probably situated within the enclosure; nor are

there any traces of the ancient port, which must

have been wholly artificial, there being no natural

inlet or harbour. (Canina, in the Ann. dclt Inst.

Arch. IS40, pp. 35—44; Dennis, Ktruria, vol. ii.

pp. 11 —16.) The goddess to whom the temple

was dedicated is called by Strabo Eileithyia, but

several other writers call her Leucothea (Arist. i

/. c.; Polyaen. I. c), who was identified with the

Mater Matuta of the Romans. There is no doubt

that the same deity is meant by both appel­

lations. (Gerhard, Outthciteu ikr EtrmWr. pp. 9,

25.) [E.H. B.]

PYRGUS or PYRGI. 1. (n^ryor. Her. Polyb.;

the most southerly town of Triphylia in iCiis, at the

mouth of the river Xeda, ujion the Messenian fron­

tier (Strab. viii. p. 34S), and hence described by

Stephanos B. (.«. ?-.) as a Messenian town. It was

one of the settlements of the Minyae. (Herod, iv.

148.) It opened its gates to Philip in the Social War.

(Polyb. iv. 77, 80.) Leake places Pyrgi at some

ancient remains upon the right bank of the Neda,

not tar from its mouth. (3/orea, vol. i. p. 57, vol. ii.
