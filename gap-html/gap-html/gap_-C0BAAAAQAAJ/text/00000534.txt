a promontory on the \Y\ atast of Libya. The

Greek version of the voyage of Hanno gives the

following statement;— "On the third day after

our departure from the Chariot of the Gods (Qtwv

uxvp*), having sailed l»y tho>e streams of fire

(previously described), we arrived at a bay called

the Southern Hon», at the bottom of which lay

an island like the former, having a lake, and in

this lake another island, full of savage people, the

greater part of whom were women, whose bodies

were hairy, and whom our interpreters called Go-

rillae. Though we pursued the men, we could not

seize any of them; hut all fled from OS, escaping

over the precipices, and defending themselves with

stones. Three women were, however, taken ; but

they attacked their conductors with their teeth and

hands, and could not be prevailed upon to accom­

pany us. Having killed them, wc Bayed them, and

brought their skins with us to Carthage. We did

not sail further on, our provisions failing us." A

similar story is told by Eudoxus of Cyzicus, as

quoted by Mela (iii. 9; comp. l'lin. v. 1.) These

fires do not prove volcanic action, as it must be re­

collected that the common custom in those countries

—as, for instance, among the Mamiingns, as reported

by Mungo Park—of setting fire at certain seasons

to the forests and dry grass, might have given rise

to the statements of tho Carthaginian navigator. In

our own times, the island of Amsterdam was set

down as volcanic from the same mistake. (Dauheny.

Volcanoes, p. 440.) The " Chariot of the Gixls"

lias been identified with Sagres; the distance of

three days' sail agrees very well with S/itrboro, to

the S. of Sierra Leone, while Man no's bland co­

incides with that called Maeasdeu in the charts, the

peculiarity of which is, that it has on its S. shore,

«ir sea face, a lake of pure fresh water of consider­

able extent, just within high-water mark; and in­

side of, and close to it, another still larger, salt.

(Jonm. Ceog. Soc. vol. ii. p. 89.) The Gorillae,

no doubt, belonged to the family of the nntliropoid

apes; the Mamiingns still call the u Orang-Outan"

by the name " Toorilla," which, as Kings (ap. Mi'tl-

Ur, I.e.), the latest editor of Hanno, observes, might

the form it bears

easily assume the form it bears in the Gwfc

text. [F.B.J.]
