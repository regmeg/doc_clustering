PROTE (ItywTn). An island oft'the western

coast of MeMienia. [See Vol. II. p. 342, b.J

^. One ot the Stocrhadcs oft' the southern coast

of lianl. [STOKt'HAlUM.]

PROTUNICA, a place in Bithynia, on the road

from Xicaen to Ancyra. (/tin. llieros, p. 573.) It

is possibly the same place as Protoinacrae (Tlpurofid-

Kpcu) mentioned by Ptolemy (v. i. § 13). [L. S.]

PROVTNCIA. The part ot Gallia which bordered

on Italy and was bounded on tlie south by the Medi­

terranean was Gallia Provincia (Caen. B. G. i. 19),

:i term by which Caesar sometimes distinguishes

this part of Gallia from the rest, which he falls

uomnia Gallia " (Ii. G. i. I) or " tota Gallia "(B.C.

vii. C6). The Provincia in < laesar's time was bounded

on the nnrth by the Rhone from the western extremity

of the Lacus LemannuH (Lake of Geneva) to the

junction of t he Rhone and the Saone. Geneva, which

belonged to the Allobrogcs, was the furthest town in

th.it direction [GkxkyaJ. Along tlie southern side

tit'the Lahf of Geneva the limit was the boundary

between the Allobroges who were in the Provincia

and the Nantuates who were not. (/>. G. iii. *>.)

1 he Alps were the eastern boundary. <keelum

[Ocei.Um] was in the Citerior I'rovincia or Gallia

(.'isalpina, ami the country of the Vocontii was in

the Ulterior Provincia or in the I'rovincia Gallia

(B. G. i. U>). On the west the Moot Ccvenna

( Cerenncs) southward from the latitude of Lugdunum

{/.>/<m) uas the boundary. The Volcae Arecomici

were within the I'rovincia, and also tlie towns of

Narho (jVnrfronHe), Carcaso (Carauojott*;), and To­

losa (Toulottge), as we see fi oin a passage in Caesar

(B. G. iii. 20). Part of the Itnteni, called Provin-

ctales (B. G. vii. 7), were in the I'rovincia; and also

tlif Helvii, who were separated from the Arverui by

the Cevenna (B. G. vii. 8). The Kutcni who were

not in the Provincia, the Gabali, Nitiobriges, and

Cadurci bordered on it on the west.

The Roman troops were in this country during the

Sec ond Punic War when Hannibal was on his road

to Italy; but the Romans first got a footing there

through the people of Massilia, who called tor their

help b.c. 154. In B.C. \'2'2 the Romans made a

settlement, Aojiiae Sextiae (Atx), which we may

consider to Ik; the commencement of their occupation

of the country east of the Rhone. [GalUa, Vol. 1.

p. 953.] The conquest of tlie Salves and Vocontii,

and of the Allobroges, gave the Romans all the

country on the east side of the Rhone, The settle­

ment of Narbo (Xarbotme) in B.C. 118, near the

border of Spain and in a position which gave easy

access to the basin of the Goronne,, secured the Ro­

man dominion on the west side of the Rhone as far

as the Pyrenees. But the Romans had many a bloody

battle to tic lit iN'fnre they were sale oil Gallic ground.

*1 he capture of Tolosa ( Toulmm ) in tlie country of  
the Volcae Tcctnsages by the consul Q. Scrvilitu

Caepio (li. c. 106) extended the limits of the Pro­

vincia as far as this rich town. (I)iun Cass. Fr. 97,

&c.) Rut the Roman dominion was not safe even in

v.. c. 58. when the proconsul Caesar received Gallia

as one of his provinces. His subjugation ot" all Gallia

linallv secured the Romans on that side. [Vol. I. p.

954, &c]

In the division of all Gallia by Augustus the

I'rovincia retained its limits pretty nearly: ami it was

from this time generally called Niirboneusis Provincia,

ami sometimes Gallia Braccata, The names which

occur in the Greek writers are: K(ATo>a\OTi'a fittp-

feVt'^jia (Ptol. ii. 10. § 1). '] NepfaiiT'jj faKaTia

There is no doubt that the name Br^<ra'a<: i<-.-

cata is derived from the dress of the GalU (*« l«

sagatos bracatosqae versari." Cic.pro/uakia,*. In

and the word " braca " is Celtic.
