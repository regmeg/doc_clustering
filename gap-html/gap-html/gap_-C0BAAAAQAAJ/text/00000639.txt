(flin. Ant. pp. 257, 275.) Its site is generally

identified with the modern Partenkirchen. [L.S.]

PARTHE'NI PARTHI'NI (tiopoW, rioptW,

n<ty>t>.Vt», Strab. vii. p. 326; Appian, Illyr. 1;

Dion Cass. xli. 49; Cic in Pit. 40; Pomp. Mela,

ii. 3. § 11; Plin. iii. 26), a people of Grecian IBy-

ricum, who may be placed to the N. in the neigh­

bourhood of Epidamnus, and, consequently, next to

the Taulantii. They are often mentioned in the

course of the war with Illyricum, B.C. 229, but as

friends rather than foes of the Romans, having

submitted at an early period to their arms. (Polyb.

ii. 11; Liv. xxix. 12.) After the death of Philip,

king of Macedon, they appear to have been added to

the dominions of Pleuratus, an lllyrian prince allied

to the Romans. (Polyb. xviii. 30; Liv. xxx. 34,

xliv. 30.) Their principal town was Parthus

(ndptfos, Steph. B. *. v.), which was taken by

Caesar in the course of his campaign with Pom-

peius. (Caes. B. C. iii. 41.) In Leake's map the

site is marked at Ardhenitzai^?). The double-lulled

Oiinalltim, the strongest among the lllyrian places,

with two citadels on two heights, connected by a

wall (Polyb. iii. 18, vii. 9), was within their terri­

tory. There is no indication, however, of its precise

situation, which was probably between Lissus and

Epidamnus. Of Ecgenium and Bakgulum, two

other fortresses noticed by Livy (xxix. 12), nothing

further is known. [E. B. J.]

PARTHEXIAS. [Harpina.]

PARTHE'NIUM (t6 napeeVioc 6pos), a moun­

tain on the frontiers of Arcadia and Argolis, across

which there was an important pass leading from

Argos to Tegea. [See Vol. L pp. 201, 202 ]

(Paus. viii. 6. § 4; Strab. viii. pp. 376, 389; Po­

lyb. iv. 23; Liv. xxxiv. 26; Plin. iv. 6. s. 10.) It

was sacred to Pan; and it was upon this mountain

that the courier Phcidippides said that he had had

an interview with Pan on returning from Sparta,

whither he had gone to ask assistance for tho

Athenians shortly before the battle of Marathon.

(Herod, vi. 105; Paus. i. 28. § 4, viii. 54. § 6.)

The pass is still called Partheni, but the whole

mountain bears the name of KMno. It is 3993

feet in height. (Leake, 3/orea, vol. ii. p. 329, seq.;

Ptlopimncsiaca, p. 203.)

PARTHE'NIUM (Jlaftinov), a town in Myaa,

in the south of Pergamum. (Xenoph. Anab. vii. 8.

§§ 15,21; Plin. v. 33.) Its exact site has not been

ascertained. [_L. &]

PARTHE'NIUM MARE (napflewKoi- WAU70S,

Greg. Naz. Or. xix.), the eastern part of the Mare

Internum, between Egypt and Cyprus. (Amm.

Marc. xiv. 8. § 10: from which writer it also ap­

pears that it was sometimes called t he Issiac Sea —

"a vespera (Aegyptus) Issiaco disjungitur mari,

quod quidam nominavere Partheniuln,,, xxii. 15.

§2.) [T.H D.]

PARTHE'NIUS (riopSfnos), the most important

river in the west of Paphhuionia. It owes its Greek

name probably to a similarity in the sound of its

native appellation, which is still liartan-Su or Bar.

<«ne; though Greek authors fabled that it derived

its name from the fact that Artemis loved to bathe

in its waters (Scymn. 226, foil.) or to hunt on its

banks, or from the purity of its waters. The

river has its sources on mount Olgassys, and in its

north-western course formed the boundary between

Paphlagonia and Bithynia. It empties itself into

the Euxine about 90 stadia west of Amastris. (Hum.
