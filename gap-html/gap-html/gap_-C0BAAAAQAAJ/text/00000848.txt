he that* if the Via Tiburtina always issued from the

Porta S. Lorenzo, we have no road to assign to the

now closed gate adjoining the Praetorian camp, nor

yet to the Porta Vuninalis of tho Servian walls, a

circumstance certainly remarkable, us it seems un­

likely that sucli an opening should have been made

in the agger without absolute necessity. On the

other hand, the absence of all mention of that gate

prior to the time of Strabo would lead one to suspect

that it was not one of the principal outlets of the

city; and a passage from Ovid, quoted by M. Becker,

certainly affords some presumption that the roud

from Tibur, in ancient times, actually entered the

city by the Porta EsquiHna {Fast. v. G84). This

is, in fart, the mo.>t important, perhaps the only

important, point of the question; for if the change in

the names had already taken place as early as the

time of Procopius, width Xiebuhr himself seems

disposed to acknowledge; it is hardly worth while

to inquire whether the gate* had borne the same

appellations during the short interval from Honorius

to Justinian'' (Clots. Mus. vol. iii. p. 369, seq.).

The Porta Tiburtina (S. Lorenzo) is built near

an arch of the Aquae Marcia, Tepula, and Julia,

which here flow over one another in three different

canals. The arch of the gate corresponds with

that of the aqueduct, but the latter is encumbered

with rubbish, and therefore appears very low, whilst

the gate is built on the rubbish itself. As the in­

scription on it appeared on several of the other

gates, we shall here insert it : S.P.Q.R. hupp. DD.

and concealed on the outside by the Honorian wall.
