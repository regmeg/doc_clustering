I'SIUM (bin, /tin. Anton, p. 167; Isui, Not.

Imp.), was a furt situated on tho borders of the

Thcbaid and lleptanmnis in Egypt, in lat. 27° 5' X.,

anil on the eastern bank of the Nile. Isium was

■Unit 20 miles SE. from the castle of Hicracon, and

nearly 24 miles XE. from that of Muthis. Under

the Roman empire a troop of British infantry (ala

Britonum) was stationed there. [W. B. 1).]

ISIUS MOSS (to"Io-.of Spos, Ptol. iv. 7. § 5), a

mountain, or rather a ridge of highlands rising gra­

dually on its western side, but steep and escarped

towards the east, on the coast of Acthiopia, and in

the Regio Trogkidytica. It was seated in lat. 20°

1' X., a little to the southward of the headland Mne-

mium (Mkth«iok inpoe, I'tol. iv. 5. § 7), and SW.

of IVrenice and the Sinus Immundus (Foul Bay).

Minis Isius answers to the modern fias-el-Dwaer.

Strabo, indeed (xvii. p. 770), places this eminence

furl her to the south, and says that it was so called

from a temple of Isis near its summit. [W. B. D.]

ISMAKIS ('lvpapit \lfirn), a small lake on the

eastern side rises Mu Ismarus. [Ismakus.] [L. S.]

l'SMAIU'S Cla>iap«j), a mountain rising on the

(Virg. Ed. vi. 30, Georg. ii. 37 ; Propert. ii. 13.

5. iii. 12. 25 : LucrcL v. 31, where it is called Is-

niara, as in Virg. Am. %. 351.) Homer (Od. ix.

40, 198) speaks of Ismarus as a town of the Cicones,

on or at the foot of the mountain. (Coinp. Marc.

Heracl. 28.) The name of the town also appears in

the form Ismaron. (I'lin. iv. 18.) The district about

Ismarus produced wine which was highly estwmed.

'Lioivi, Issacus, Iaseusis, Issaicus: Li/tn), one of

the most well known of the islands in the Adriatic,

off the coast of Libtimia. (Strah. vii. p. 315.) It

is mentioned by Scylax (p. 8) as a Grecian colony,

which, according to Scymnus of Chios (L 412), was

sent from Syracuse. Dindnrns (xv. 13) relates that

in n. c 3S7 Diunysius the elder, in his attempts to

secure to himself the sovereignty of the Adriatic,

assisted the Parians in founding colonies at Issa ami

Pharos. The island was besifged by Agnm, king

of Illyria, and the inhabitants applied to Rome for

protection, when a message was sent by the Romans

to Agnm, requiring him to desist from molesting the

friends of the republic In the mean time, n, c. 232,

Apron died; and his widow Teuta, having succeeded

to the throne, resolved on pressing the siege of Issa.

The Roman envoys required her to cease from hos­

tilities, when, in defiance of the law of nations, she

put one of them to death. This brought on the First

lllyrian War. B. (-. 229; one of the consequences of

which was the liberation of Issa. (Polyb. ii. 8; Ann.

lllyr. 7.) That Issa remained free for a long time

is proved by its coins, which also show that the

island was famous for its wine (comp. Athen. i. p.

22), bearing, as they do, an "amphora" on one

side, and on the other a vine with leaves. ( K- l.h-).

vol. ii. p. 159.) The inhabitants were expert tea­

men, atid their beaked ships, " Lembi Issaici," ren­

dered the Romans especial service in the war with

Philip of Maccdon. (Liv. xxxL 45, xxxvii. 16,

xlii. 48.) They were exempted from the )«ymmi

of tribute (Liv. xlv. 8), and were reckoned as Roman

citizens (Piin. iii. 21). In the time of Caesar the

chief town of this island appears to have been nxy

flourishing.

The island now called Luua rises from the sea. to

that it is seen at a considerable distance; it has two

ports, the larger one on the XE. side, with a town

of the same name: the soil is barren,and wine forma

its chief produce. Lissa is memorable in modem

times for the victory obtained by Sir \V. Hoste over

the French squadron in 1811. (Sir G. Wilkinson,

ISSE'DOXES CUaj,t6im, Steph. B. : V.; in

the Roman writers the usual form is "E«se-

dones"), a people living to the E. of the Arg'p-

paci, and the most remote of the tribes of Cen­

tral Asia with whom the Hellenic colonies on

the Euxine had any communication. The name

is found as early as the Spartan Alcman, n. c. 671

—631, who calls them "Assedones" (». 94,

ed. Welcker), and Hecataeus (/V.I68. ed. Klau-

scn). A great movement among the nomad tril«-s of

the N. had taken place in very remote titnr~. fal­

lowing a direction from XE. toSW.; theArimaspi

had driven out the Issedones fmm the steppes over

which tliry wandered, and they in turn drove

out the Scythians, and the Scythians the Cim­

merians. Traces of these migrations were indicated

in the poem of Aristcas of Proomnesns, a -rmi-

mythical |«rsonage, whoso pilgrimage to the land i.f

the Issedones was strangely disfigured after his

death by the fables of the Milesian colonist*. (Herod,

iv. 13.) The Issedones, according to Herodotus (iv.

26), have a custom, when any one loses his father,

for the kinsfolk to kill a certain number of sheep,

whose flesh they hash up together with that of the

dead man, and make merry over it. This done,

they peel and clean out his skull, which after it has

been gilded becomes a kind of idol to which yearly

sacrifices are offered. In all other respects they are

a righteous people, submitting to the rule of wimrn

equally with that of men ; in other words, a civilian!
