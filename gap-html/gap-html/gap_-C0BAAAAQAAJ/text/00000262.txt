2 I t MAKN'ATUAE INSTILAE. MAEPHA.

va\tvs\ a town of Arcadia, and the capital of the

district Maeiudia (ManuAia, T!iuc. v, 04; Paus.

iii. 11. § 7, vi. 7. § 9, viii. 9. § 4), which formed

part of the territory of Megalopolis upon the foun­

dation of the latter city. A li^t of the towns in Mae-

nalia is given in Vol. I. p. 192. The town Maenalus

was in ruins in the time of Pansnnias, who mentions

a temple of Athena, a stadium, and a hippodrome, as

belonging to the place, (Paus. viii. 3. § 4, 30.

§ 8: Steph. IS s. v ) Its site is uncertain, lioss

supposes that the remains of polygonal wails on the

isolated hill, on the right hank of the river Helisson

and opposite the village Davia, represent Maenalus;

and this appears more proltable than the opinion of

Leake, who identifies this site with Dipaea, and

thinks that Maenalus stood on Ml. Ajmno-khrepa,

(Iioss, JitistH iin rdoponnes, vol. i. p. 117; Leake,

Morea, vol. ii. p. 52, J'clopontttshica, p. 243.)

MAKXA'RIAK INSULAE, a cluster of Utile

islands in tin? gulf of Talma, off the coast of the

Greater llalearis. (Plin. iii. 5. 8. 1 I.) [1*. S.]

MAE'NOBA (Mela, ii. 6. § 7; Plin. iii. 1. s. 3;

MoVoSo, Ptol. H.4-§ 7; Mknova, Itin. Ant. p. 405:

Vela Malaga), a town of the Bastuli Poeni, on the S.

coast of Baetiea, 12 M. 1*. K. of Malaea, on a river of

the same namo ( Velez). Strabo (iii.p. 143) also men­

tions Maenoha(MaiVe§a),with Astra, Nabrissa.Onoba,

and Oisonoba, as towns remarkable for their situation

on tidal estuaries; whence Ukert argues that, since

not only all the other places thus mentioned were

outside of the Straits, but also Strabo's description

necessarily applies to an estuary exposed to the tides

of the Atlantic, we must seek for his Maenoba else­

where than on the titleless Mediterranean. Accord­

ingly, he places it on the river Maenoba or Menuba

(GiuHiiamar), tire lowest of the great tributaries of

the Baetis, on its right side, mentioned both by Pliny

(ni. I. s. 3), and in an inscription found at San Lu

cur la Mayor (Cam, ap.Florez, Esp.S. vol.ix.p.47),

up which river the tide extends to a considerable

distance. (Ukert, vol. ii. pt. 1. pp. 288, 349, 350.)

This argument, though doubtful, has certainly

some force, and it is adopted by Spruner in his

Atlas. [I*-S.]

MAK'XOBA (Ma^oSo), rivers. [Makmoba.]

MAENOBOTtA (Maiyo€upa), a town of the

Mastiani, in the S. of Spain, mentioned by Hecataeus

(ap. Suph. Ii. s. v.), seems to be identical with

Maknoha on the. S. coast of Baetiea. [P. S ]

M A EO'Nl A (yiaiovla), an ancient name of Lydia.

[Lydia.] There was, also, in later times a town

of this name in Lydia, mentioned by Pliny (v. 29.

s. 30), literacies (p. 670). and in tlie Episcopal No-

titia; and of which several coins are extant. Its ruins

have been found at a place called Megnc, 5 English

miles W. of SandaL (Hamilton, Hesearches, vol. ii.

p. 139.)

MAEO'TAE (MaiwTat, Scyl. p. 31; Strab. xi.

pp. 492, 494; Plin. iv. 26; Maeotici, Pomp. Mela,

i. 2. § fi, i. 19. § 17; Plin. vi. 7), a collective name

which was given to the peoples about the Pains

Maeotis as early as the logographer hMIaninu

(p. 78), if we read with his editor Stun (for Ma-

Aiwrtti), MaiwTai. According to Strabo (/. c.) thft

lived partly on fish, and partly tilled the land, bui

were no less warlike than their nomad neighbours.

He enumerates tlie following subdivisions of tht

Maeotae; Sindi, Dandarii, Toreatae. Agri, Arrtchi,

Tarpetes, Obidiaccni, Sittaeeni, Dosci, and nanj

others. These wild hordes were sometimes tributary

to the factory at the Tanais, and at other times to

the Bosporani, revolting from one to the other. 1 lie

kingdom of tlie Cimmerian Bosporus in later tirow,

especially under Pharnaces, Asander, and Potetnoo,

extended as far as the Tanais. [E. B. J.]

MAEO'TIS PALI'S, the large body uf watf r to

the NE. of the Euxine now called the Sea of Am,

or the Azdk-deniz-i of the 'l urks. This sea w«

usually called Palus Maeotis" Nwvrti Aifwa,

Aesch. I'rom. 427), but sometimes "Maeotica" w

"Macotta Palus(Plin. ii. 07; Lncan, ii. 641).

"Maeotius '* or " Maeotis Lacus" (Plin. iv. 24, vi.

6), "MaeHiuin" or "Macoticum aeqnor" (Atwu.

v. 32; Yal. Flac. iv. 720), "Cimmeriae Palude*"

(Claud, tn Eutrnp, i. 249 ), " Cimmericum" or " Bv

poricum Mare" ((Jell. xvii. 8). '* Scythicac UuA*

Paludes " (Ovid. Her. vi. 107, Trist. iii. 4. 49> T«

genitive in Latin followed the Greek form *M»-

otidis," but was sometimes "Maeotis " (EnnTO&,«*

Cic. Tusc. r, 17). The accusative has the two form

Maiuinu "Maeotim" (Plin. x. 10). and Mauiri&

"Maeotida* (Pomp. Mela, i. 3. $ I, ii. I. \ V

Pliny (vi, 7) has preserved the Scythian nanu- T<

merindu, which ho translates by *' Mater Maris.''

Tlie Macotic gulf, with a surface of rather mor

than 13,000 square miles, was supposed by the a:

cients to be of far larger dimensions than it

is. Thus Herodotus (iv. 80) believed it to be i?

much less in extent than the Euxine, while Sob

(p. 30, ed. Hudson) calculated it at half the si» ■

that sea. Strabo (ii. p. 125, comp. vii. pp. 307-

312, xi. p. 493; Arrian. Perip. p. 20, ed. Hud-«

Agathem. i. 3, ii. 14) estimated the circumference

somewhat more than 9000 stadia, but Poly bins 0

39) reduces it to 8000 stadia. According to Pi:

(iv. 24) its circuit was reckoned at 1406 M. P- ■

according to some, 1125 M. P. Strabo (vii. p.311

reckons it in length 2200 stadia between the Ci

merian Bosporus and the mouth of the Tanai*. a

therefore came nearest amongst the ancients in t

length; but lie seems to have supposed it to an

its width on towards the Tanais (comp. Bern*

ComjHir. Gtog. vol. ii. p 331). The length acorx

ing to Pliny (/. c.) is 385 M. P., which agrees »

the estimate of Ptolemy (v. 9. 1—7). Pulyb

(/. c.) confidently anticipated an entire and spa

choking of tlie waters of the Maeotis; and ever sa

his time the theory that the Sea of Azov has c

tract ed its boundaries has met with cvrtsidm

support, though on this pant there U a rrtit<

discordance among the various authorities; the U

statement, and approximation to the amount *4

cubic contents will be, found in Admiral Smj

work (The Mediterranean^ p. 148). Tbe and

appear to have been correct in their a^ertioo ai

the absence of salt in its waters, as, although if

winds,when the water is highest, it becuinf> bnvvi

yet at other times it is drinkable, though of a *

grecable flavour (Jones, Trav. vol. ii. j*. 143; J<
