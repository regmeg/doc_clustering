prevail against the admitted facts, " that a place

called Ramathem or Iiamatha did anciently exist in

this region, somewhere not far distant from Lydda"

(Bibl. Jtes. vol. iii. p. 40), and that no other place

can be found answering to this description but

Ramleh, which has been regarded from very early

times as the place in question. The facts of Ramleh

having been built by Suliman, son of the khalif

Abd-el-Melik, after the destruction of Lydda in the

early part of the 8th century, and that the Arabic

name signifies " the sand," will not seriously mili­

tate agHinst the hypotheses with those who con­

sider the great probability that the khalif would fix

on an ancient, but perhaps neglected, site for his

new town, and the common practice of the Aral*

to modify the ancient names, to which they would

attach no meaning, to similar sounds intelligible to

them, and in this instance certainly not less appre­

ciate than the ancient name; although the situation

of the town *• on a broad low swell in the sandy

though fertile plain," would satisfy the condition re­

quired by its presumed ancient designation. (Bibl.

Res. vol. iii. p. 25—43.) It may be questioned

whether t henomus of Ramathem, ment ioned w ith t hose

of Apbeiremaand Lydda,as taken from Samaritisand

added to Judaea (1 Maecab. xi. 34; Josephus, Ant.

2. § 3, 4. § 9), derived its name from this or from

one of the other Ramahs, in Benjamin. [G. W.]

RAMATHA ( Po/joW), the form in which Jo-

sephus represents the name of Samuel's native city,

Ramathaim Sophim (LXX. 'ApuaOtu/x Zupd) of

Mount Ephraim (1 Sam. i. 1), perhaps identical

with Ramah, where was his ordinary residence (vii.

17, viii. 4. xix. 18—24, xxv. 1), but distinct from

the Ramah above named. Ancient tradition has

fixed this city at Neby Samicil, i. o. "The Prophet

Samuel," a village situated on a very high and

commanding hill, two hours to the NNW. of Jeru­

salem, where the place of his sepulture is shown.

Kusebius and S. Jerome, however, found it in the

western plain, near Lydda ( Onomast. s. v. A rnwiha

Sophim; see Ramath-Lehi). Dr. Robinson lias

stated his objections to the identification of Ra­

mathaim Sophim with Neby Samvtl, and has endea­

voured to fix the former much further to the south,

on the hill called Svba, a little to the south of the

Jaffa road, about 3 hours from Jerusalem; while

Mr. Wolcott has carried it as far south as the vicinity

of Hebron. (Robinson. Bibl. Res. vol. ii. pp. 139—

144, 330—334, BibL Sacra, vol. i. pp. 44—52.)

These objections are based on the hypothesis that

the incidents attending Saul's unction to the king­

dom, narrated in I Sam. ix. x., took place in Ramah of

Samuel, of which, however, there is no evidence; and

his difficulty would press almost with equal weight

on Soba, as the direct route from Saba to Gibeah

(Jeba') would certainly not have conducted Saul by

Rachel's sepulchre. Neither can the district of

Mount Ephraim be extended so far south, lndivd,

this last seems to be the strongest objection to Ae6y

Samicil, and suggests a site further north, perhaps

Ram- Ullah, in the same parallel of latitude as the

other Ramah and Bethel, which were certainly in

Mount Ephraim. (Judges, iv. 5.) On the other

hand, the name Ramah, signifying "a height," is so

remarkably applicable to A>6y Samwil, which is

evidently the site of an ancient town, which could

not, as Dr. Robinson suggests, have been Miipah,

that it would be difficult to find a position better

suited to Ramathaim Sophim than that which tra­

dition has assigned it. [MiZTAU.] [G. W.]
