1244 TUSCULUM.

TUSCrLUiL

and must therefore have belonged to those noticed

by Straho. The scholiast on Horace (Epod. i. 30)

descrihes Cicero's as being "ad latera superiora" of

the Tuscnlan hill; anil if this authority may bo re­

lied on, it disposes of the claims of Grotta Ferrata.

The plural " latera " also determines us in favour of

the W. side of the town, or Villa RtifineWt, where

the hill lias two ridges. At this spot some valuable

remains were discovered in 1741, especially a beau­

tiful mosaic, now in the Museo I'io Clementina.

The villa belonged originally to Sulla (Plin. xxii. 6.

s. C.). It was, as wc have said, close to that of Lu-

cullus, from which, in neighbourly fashion, Cicero

was accustomed to fetch books with his own hand.

(l)e Fin. iii. 2.) It was likewise near that of the

consul Gabinius (pra Dom. 24, post Red. 7), which

also stood on the Tuscnlan hill (in Pis. 21), pro­

bably on the site of the Villa Falcoriurt, In his

oration pro Sestio (43), Cicero says that his own

villa was a mere cottage in comparison with that of ]

Gabinius, though the latter, when tribune, had de­

scribed it as u pictam," in order to excite envy

against its owner. Vet from the particulars which

we learn from Cicero himself, las retirement must

have been far from deficient in splendour. The

money which he lavished on it and on his villa at

Pompeii brought him deeply into debt. (Ep. adAtt.

ii. 1.) And in another letter (lb. iv. 2) he com­

plains that the consuls valued that at Tusculum at

only quingentis mill thus, or between 4000/. and

5000/. This would be indeed a very small sum,

to judge by the description of it which we may

Collect from his own writings. Thus we learn that

il contained two gymnasia (Die. i. 5), an upper one

(ailed Lyceum, in which, like Aristotle, he was ac­

customed to walk and dispute in the morning (Tusc.

Disp. ii. 3), and to which a library was attached

(Oiv. ii. 3), and a lower one, with shady walks like

Plato's garden, to which he gave the name of the

Academy. (Tusc. Disp. ii. 3.) The latter was

perhaps on the spot now occupied by the Casino of

the Villa Rujindla. Both were adorned with beau­

tiful statues in marble and bronze. (Fp. ad Ait i.

1, 8, 9, 10.) The villa likewise contained a little

atrium (atriolum, lb. i. 10, ad Quint. Fr. iii. 1), a

small portico with exedria (ad Fam. vii. 23), a

bath (lb. xiv. 20), a covered promenade ("tecta am-

hulatiuncula," adAtt. xiii. 29), and an horologium

(ad Fam. xvi. 18). In the excavations made in

the time of Zuzzeri, a sun-dial was discovered here,

and placed in the Collegia Romano. The villa, like

the town and neighbourhood, was supplied with

water by the Aqua Crabra. (De Leg. Ayr. iii. 31.)

Hut of all this magnificence scarce a vestige re­

in, tins, unless we may regard as such the ruins now

called Scuola di Cicerone, close to the ancient walls.

These consist of a long corridor with eight chambers,

forming apparently the ground floor of an upper

building, and it'they belonged to the villa they were

probably granaries, as there is not the least trace of

dec'ration.

We will now proceed to consider the remains at

Frascati. Strabo (v. p. 239) indicates where we

inu.-it look for Tusculum, when he describes it as

situated on the high ridge connected with Mount

Albanus, and serving to form with it the deep valley

which stretches out towards Mount Algidus. This

ridge was known by the name of the Tusculani

Colics. We have already seen that Tusculum was

composed of two distinct jiarts, the town itself and

thcarxor citadel, which was isolated from it, and

seated on a higher point; wo eknfed.bfaL^
