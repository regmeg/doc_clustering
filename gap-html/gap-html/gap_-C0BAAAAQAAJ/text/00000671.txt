iv. 22, Indie. 4; newroAeurir, Strab. XT. p. 698;

Pan. vi. 17. 8.21: Eth. Pencolaitae, Plin.; Xltu-

raAeir, Uionys. Per. 1142), a district of India on the

NW. frontier, along the Cophen or Cdbul river, in

the direction of the Panjdb. The actual name of

the town, which was probably Peucela, is nowhere

found, but the form of the word leaves no doubt

that it is, like the majority of the names which have

been preserved by Arrian, of genuine Sanscrit or

Indian origin. Strabo and Pliny both call the city

itself Peucolaitis. Arrian in one place gives the

name to a district (iv. 22), without mentioning that

of the capital or chief town; in another be calls the

capital Peucelaotis, or, according to the Florentine

Ma, Peucela. (Indie, c. 1.) There can be little

doubt that this is the same place or district mentioned

in Ptolemy under the form of Proclais (vii. 1. § 44),

and in the Periplus Mar. Erythr. (c. 47). Both

are connected with the Gandarae,— the Sanscrit

Ganddras,—and both are alike placed in NW.

India. Prof. Wilson has shown that the Greek name

is derived from the Sanscrit Puskkara or Pusltkala,

the Pushkalavati of the Hindus, which was placed

by them in the country of the Gandhdras, the

Gandaritis of Strabo, and which is still represented

by the modern Pekhely or Pakholi, in the neigh­

bourhood of Peshdvmr. (Wilson, Ariana, pp. 183,

184.) [V.]

PEUCETII (newKeruw), a people of Southern

Italy, inhabiting the southern part of Apulia. This

name was that by which they were known to the

Greeks, but the Romans called them Pokdiculi,

which, according to Strabo, was the national appel­

lation employed also by themselves. (Strab. vi. pp.

277,282.) Their national affinities and origin, as well

as the geographical details of the country occupied by

them,will be found in the article Apulia. [E. II. B.J

PEUCI'NI (nei»ru<oi, Ptol. iii. 5. § 19, 10. § 9;

Strab. vii. p. 305, seq.; Plin. iv. 14. a. 28), a

branch of the Bastarnae, inhabiting the island of

Peuce. Tacitus (Germ. 46) and Jornandes (Goth,

16) write the name Peuceni, which also appears in

several MSS. of Strabo; whilst Ammianus Marcel-

linus (xxii. 8. § 43) calls them Peuci, and Zosimus

(i. 42) TltvKat. [T.H.D.]

PUAB1RANUM (*a£ipavov), a place in tho

country of the Chauci Minores, that is, the district

between the Alois and Visurgis (Ptol. ii. 11. § 27),

is generally identified with the modern city of Bre­

men; though some, with more probability, look for

its site at Brcmervorde. (Wilhelm, Germanien,

p. 162.) [L.S.]

PHA'Cll'M (tdxior: Eth. 4>okhns), a town of

Thessaly, in the district Pelasgiotis, placed by

Leake a little below the right bank of the Peneiux

at Aliftdca, but by Kiepert upon the left bank.

Brasidas marched through Phacium in u. c. 424.

(Thuc. iv. 78.) The town was laid waste by Philip,

n. c 198 (Lir. xxxli. 13), and was occupied by the

Roman praetor Baebius in the war with Antiochus,

B.C. 191. (Liv. xxxvi. 13.) Phacium is probably

the same place as Phacus, which Polybius (xxxi.

25) calls a town of Macedonia. (Comp. Steph. B.

s. v.; Leake, Northern Greece, vol. iv. p. 49.1.)

PUACUSSA (Plin. iv. 12. s. 23; ♦okoOo-o-cu,

pi., Steph. B. s. v.), an island in the Aegacan sea,

one of the Sporades, now Fecussa.
