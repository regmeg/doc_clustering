3R.S MO.NESI. MOOKTIAXA.

Timachi by the river Timachua. The Triconesii,

who derived tJicir name from Tricornum, were on

the confines of Dahnatia. The Peucini inhabited

tlie island of Peace, at the month of the Danube.

The Thraces were near their own country; the

Scordisci, between the Dardani and Dalmatia. The

^locsi, or My si, proper, inhabited the heart of the

country to which they gave their name, on the

banks of the river Ciabrus. [A. L.]

. MOGETIANA or MOGKNTIANA, a place in

Lower Pnnnonia, on the road from Sopianac to

Sabaria. (It. Ant. pp.263,233.) Its exact site is

uncertain. [L. S.J

MOGOXTIACUMor MAGOXTIACUM {Mains),

a city of Gallia, on the lthine. On this spot was

built a monument in honour of Drusus the lather of

German icus. (Eutrop. vii. 13.) Magontiacum, as

it is written in the text of Tacitus, is often men­

tioned in the history of the war of Civil is, (Tacit.

Hist iv. 15, 24, &c.) Ptolemy (ii. 9. § 14) writes

the name MokojtiokoV, and places the town in

Germania Inferior. In Eutropius the form of the

word is Mugoutiacum (ed. Verheyk); but the MSS.

have also the forms Maguntia and Moguntia, whence

is easily derived the French form Mayence, and the

German Mainz. The position of Mogontiacum at

Mainz on the Rhine is determined by the I tins,

which place it 18 M. P. from Bingium {Bingtn),

also on the Rhine. It was an important position

under the Roman empire, but no great events are

connected with the name. Ammianus Marcel linos

(xv. 11) calls it a Municipium, which means a town

that had a Roman form of administration. [G. L.J

MOGULS (Mw7pof), a navigable river in Colchis,

flowing into the Euxine between the Phasis in the

north, and the Isis in the south; its mouth is just

midway between the two, being 90 stadia distant

from each. (Arrian, Peripl. Pont. Eux. p. 7; Plin.

vi. 4.) As an ancient reading in Pliny is

Nugrus, and the Table has Nigrus, it is possible

that the real name of the river may have been Ko-

grus, and that in Arrian also we must read Nw-

ypos. [L. S.]

MOLADA (MwAaott), a town of Palestine,

reckoned among the uttermost cities of the tribe

of Judah toward the coast of Edom southward

{Joshua, xv. 21. 26), and indeed in that part which

fell to the tribe of Simeon, " whose inheritance was

within the inheritance of the children of Judah."

(lb. xix. 1, 2; 1 Chron. iv. 24. 28.) Reland re­

marks, " Videtur esse eadem ac Malatha" (I'alaesL

$. v. p. 901.), which Malatha is mentioned by Jo-

sephus as a castle of Idumaea, to which Agrippa, the

son of Aristobulus and son-in-law of Herod the Great,

retired in his distress after his return from Rome, and

where he meditated suicide. (Ant. xviii. 7. § 2.) It

is mentioned also by Eusebius and S. Jerome as

iv. M. P. distant from Arad ('Apo>d), which they

describe as an ancient city of the Anton tes, situated in

the wilderness of Kadcsh (KcESStjs), xx. M.P. from

Hebron, on the road to Ada. {Onomast. s. vv.

'Apaud, 'Aaaouv dapd*; Reland, Palaettina, i.e.

Malatha, pp. 885, 886.) The site of Arad u still

marked by a ruin of the same name, at the required

distance S. of H»'bron; near to which are wells and

ruins named El MiUi, which Dr. Robinson " was

disposed to rvjrard as marking the site of the an­

cient Moladah of the Old Testament, the Malatha

of the Greeks and Romans." {Bib. He*, vol. ii.

p. 621.) [G.W.]

MOLINDAE (Plin. vl 19. s. 22), a jtcoplc u*en­

tioned by Pliny, who lived in the eastern part of

India extra Gangem. It seems probable that they

are the same as those noticed by Ptuleiny with tie)

name Marundae (yiapovvb'at, viL 2. § 14). [V.J

distance from the promontory Antirrhiam, whtcb

was hence called 'Piov to MoAi/irpiJcoV (Tunc iL 86),

or MoKvKptov "Piov. (Strab. viii. p. 336.) Some

writers call it a Locriau town. It is said by Strabc

to have been built after the return of the Herat tedae

into Peloponnesus. It was colonised by the Corinth­

ians, but was subject to the Athenians in the early

part of the Peloponnesian War. It was taken by the

Spartan commander Eurylochus, with tlie assistance

of the Aetolians, a.c. 426. It was considered sacml

to Poseidon. (Strab. x. pp. 451, 460; ScyL p. 14;

MOMEMPHIS (Mfotuupu, Strab. xrii. p. 803:

Diodor. i. G6, 97; Steph. B. i. v.), the capital of the

nome Mo-Mcmphitis, in the Delta. It was seated in

lat. 31°5' N.,on the eastern shore of the lake Marrotis,

N. of the Natron Lakes. Both its ancient and iU

modern appellation—ManoufeUejjly—indicate its

position as the Lower Memphis, or Memphis in the

mar&hes. During the troubles which led to the

Dodecarchy, Momemphis was a place of some

strength, owing to the difficulties of its apfmsachea.

It was chiefly remarkable for its exportation of

mineral alkalies from the neighbouring Natron

Lakes. Athor or Aphrodite, under the f<*n of a

cow, was worshipped at M jmetnphis. [W. B. D.]

MONA (Mora, Ptol. iii. 2. § 12; Majm, Dion

Cass. Uii. 7), an island in Britain, off the 1—it

of tlie Ordovices, the /We of' An<jU*ty.

Caesar describes sl<>na as situated in the middle

of the pas>a;:e from Britain to Ireland {B. <j. r. l.'t).

but by Mona in this passage he must mean the

Isle of Man, which Phny calls Mchcapia (iv. 16.

s. 30); and Ptolemy that of Mokaiuxa or Mu-

NAOKUA (Moraptra, Muvaoi&a).

The I tic of Anglesey was first invaded by Sot-

ton ins Paullinus, governor of Britain under Sera,

a .ii. til. Previous to the appointment of Surto-

nius Paullinus, the Hot nans liad met with S'mie re­

verses in the west of Britain. From the vigoruo*

measures adopted by Paullinus on entering upun the

government of Britain, U may be inferred that tike

Druids of Mona bad excited the Ordo vices axad the

Silurea to rise in rebellion; or had assisted them;

probably both. Tacitus states that M»ua was a re­

ceptacle for fugitives. The island was well }*»pun

and there the priests of the Druidical niigMSt I

established themselves in great strength. Vt

was recalled from the conquest of AngUsry by the

revolt of the Britons under Boadicea, and ita aubjo-

gation was not completed till A. u. 78 by Agnrulsv
