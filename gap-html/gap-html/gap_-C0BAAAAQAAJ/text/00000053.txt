ILLICL 35 ILLYRICUM.

th« name Elne in the fact that either the name of

IlKberis was changed to Helena or Elena, or Helena

was a camp or station near it. Constans was mur­

dered by Magnentius "not far from the Hispaniae,

in a castmm named Helena." (Eutrop. z. 9.) Vic­

tor's Epitome (c. 41) describes Helena as a town

very near to the Pyrenees; and Zosimos has the

Hune (iL 42; and Orosius, vii. 29). It is said by

sume writers that Helena was so named after the

place was restored by Constantino's mother Helena,

or by Constantine, or by some of his children; but

the evidence of this is not given. The river of llli-

beris is the Ticiiis of Mela, and Tecum of Pliny,

now the Tech. In the text of Ptolemy (ii. 10) the

name of the river is written Uteris.

Some geographers have supposed Hliberis to be

CutJioure, near Port Venire, which is a plain mis­

take. [G. L.]

'lAoupytia of Polybius, ap. Steph. B. s. v.. and the

l\ipyia of Appian, Hisp. 32: Elh. Illurgitani),

a considerable city of Hispania Baetica, situated on

a steep rock on the N. side of the Buetis, on the

road from Corduba to Castulo. 20 M. P. from the

latter, and five days' march from Carthago Nova.

In the Second Punic War it went over to the

Romans, like its neighbours, Castulo and Mentesa,

and endured two sieges by the Carthaginians, both

of which were raised; but, upon the overthrow of

the two Scipios, the people of Illiturgis and Castulo

revolted to the Carthaginians, the former adding to

their treason the crime of betraying and putting to

death the Romans who had fled to them for refuge.

At least snch is the Roman version of their otfence,

for which a truly Roman vengeance was taken by

Pnblius Scipio, b.c 206. After a defence, such as

mi^ht be expected when despair of mercy was added

to national fortitude, the city was stormed and burnt

over the slaughtered corpses of all its inhabitants,

children and women as well as men. (Liv. xxiii. 49,

xxiv. 41, xxvi. 17,41, xxviii. 19,20.) Ten years

later it had recovered sufficiently to be again besieged

by the Romans, and taken with the slaughter of all

its adult inah population. (Liv. xxxiv. 10.) Under

the Roman empire it was a considerable city, with

the surname of Forum Jumum. Its site is believed

to have been in the neighbourhood of Andujar,

where the church of S. Potenciana now stands, (/tin.

(iKKvpts, Hecat. Fr. 65; Polyb. iii. 16; Strab. ii.

pp. 108, 123, 129, vii. p. 317; Dionys. Per. 96;

Hcrodian, vi. 7; Apollod. ii. 1. § 3; Ptol. viii. 7.

the name of the people, oi 'WKvpioi (tV toTs 'IAAo-

plotf, Herod. L 196, iv. 49; Scyl. pp. 7, 10). The

name lLi.YKiA('I\Aopta)very rarely occurs. (Steph.

B. 8. v.; Prop. i. 8. 2.) By the Latin writers it

generally went under the name of "Illyricum"

(Caes. B. G. ii. 35, iii. 7; Varr. R. R. ii. 10. § 7;

Cic. ad Att x. 6; Liv. xliv. 18, 26; Ovid, Tritt. i.

vii. 2; Suet. Tib. 16; Veil. Pat. ii. 109), and the

general assent of geographers has given currency to

this form.

2. Extent and Limits. — The Roman Illyricum

was of very different extent from the Illyris or oi

'iAAvpioi of the Greeks, and was itself not the same

at all times, but must be considered simply as an

artificial and geographical expression for the bor­

derers who occupied the E. coast of the Adriatic,

from the junction of that gulf with the Ionic sea, to

the estuaries of the river Po. The earliest writer

who has left any account of the peoples inhabiting

this coast is Scylax; according to whom (c. 19—27)

the Illyrians, properly so called (for the Liburnians

and Istrians beyond tnem are excluded), occupy the

sea-coast from Libumia to the Chaonians of Epirus.

The Bulini were the northernmost of these tribes, and

the Atnantini the southernmost. Herodotus (i. 196)

includes under the name, the Heneti or Veneti, who

lived at the head of the gulf; in another passage (iv.

49) he places the Illyrians on the tributary streams

of the Morava in Servia.

It is evident that the Gallic invasions, of which

there are several traditions, threw the whole of these

districts and their tribes into snch confusion, that it

is impossible to harmonise the statements of the

Periplus of Scylax, or the far later Scymnus of

Chios, with the descriptions in Strabo and the Roman

historians.

In consequence of this immigration of the Ganls,

Appian has confounded together Gauls, Thracians,

Paconians, and Illyrians. A legend which he records

(IUyr. 1) makes Celtus, Illyrius, and Gala, to have

been three brothers, the sons of the Cyclups Poly­

phemus, and is grounded probably on the inter­

mixture of Celtic tribes (the Boii, the Scordisci, and

the Taurisci) among the Illyrians: the Iapodes, a

tribe on the borders "of Istria, are described by Strabo

(iv. p. 143) as half Celts, half Illyrians. On a

rough estimate, it may be said that, in the earliest

times, Illyricum was the coast between the Naro

(Neretvd) and the Drilo (Drin), bounded on the E.

by the Triballi. At a later period it comprised all

the various tribes from the Celtic Taurisci to the

Epirots and Macedonians, and eastward as far as

Moesia, including the Veneti, Pannonians, Dalma­

tians, Dardani, Autariatae, and many others. This

is Illyricum in its most extended meaning in the

ancient writers till the 2nd century of the Christian

era: as, for instance, in Strabo (vii. pp. 313—319),

during the reign of Augustus, and in Tacitus (Hist.

i. 2, 9, 76, ii. 86; comp. Joseph. B.J. ii. 16), in his

account of the civil wars which preceded the fall of

Jerusalem. When the boundary of Rome reached to

the Danube, the " Hlyricus Limes" (as it is desig­

nated in the "Scriptores Historiae Augustae "), or

"Illyrian frontier, comprised the following pro­

vinces: — Noricum, Panuonia Superior, Pannonia
