were removed to the west side of the Rhine. The

Toxaiulri. who were fettled in Xorth Brabant, occu­

pied tin- place of those Menapii who bordered on the

Eburones. But the Menapii Btill maintained them­

selves on the west Tacitus (Hift. iv. 28), in his

description of the rebellion of Civilis, still speaks of

the "Menapins ct Morinos ct eitrema Galliarum."

Part of the former territory of the Menapii was

finallv included in Gemiania Inferior, and the rest

in Be'lgica, The name Menapii subsisted for a long

time, Aurclius Victor ((fc Caetaribut, 39) calls

Carau-ius " Men.ipiae civis;" and it appears in the

middle ages. D'Anville observes that though the

Notitia of the Empire mentions a body of soldiers

named Menapii, we see no trace of this nation in

any city which represents it; but\Valckenaer(G«)fl.

<fc. vol. i. p. 460) contends that Turnacum

(Timrnai) was their chief place, to which place

probably belong the Belgic silver medals with the

legend DVRSAcvs (Bast, Kecueil, <fc.) "In an

act of Charles the Bald, A. I>. 8+7. in favour of the

abbey of St. Amand, which is south of Tournai, this

abbey is said to be 'in territorio Menapionim quod

nunc Mempiscum appellant.'" We thus obtain, as

it seems, a fixed point for part of the territory of the

Menapii, which under the later Empire may have

been limited to the country west of the Schelde.

It is observed that u though it is very probable

that Caesar never advanced into the interior of

Flanders, it is, however, certain that the Romans

afterwards, if they did not absolutely make them­

selves masters of it, at least were there for some

time at different e|wchs. Their idols, their Dei Pe­

nates, sepulchral urns, lamps, Roman utensils, and

especially the medals of almost all the emperors,

discovered in great numbers, are irrefragable evi­

dence ofthis." (Bast, liecutil dAntiquites Iiomaintt

et Gaulovtet, <fc., Introduction.)

"Ancient earthen vessels have been found in

great numbers all along the coast from Dunkerque

to Bruges, which shows that the sea has not gained

here, and refutes the notion that in the time of

Caesar and Pliny this coast was neither inhabited

nor habitable." (Walrkenaer.tsr'oo. <fc vol. i. p. 469.)

An inscription found at Rimini, of the age of Ves­

pasian, mentions the "Salinatores Menapiorum," or

salnnakers of the Menapii.

If the position of the Meldi of Caesar has been

rightly determined [MEI.m], they were a Menapian

people. There is nothing to show whether the Me­

napii were Oalli or Germani. • [G. L.]

arrival of Brasidas, Mcnde revolted from the Athe

ninns (Thuc. I.e.), but was afterwards retaken by

Nicias and Nicostratus (Thuc. iv. 130; Diod.

xii. 72). It appears, from the account which Livy

(i c.) gives of the expedition of Attains and the

Romans (b.0.200), to have been a small maritime

place under the dominion of Cassandria. Together

with Scione, Mendc occupied the broadest part of

the peninsula (Pomp. Mela, ii. 3. § 11), and is

flows into the lake of Tanis. Mendes wa», under

the Pharaonic kings, a considerable town: the

nome was the chief seat of the worship of Mendes

or Pan, the all-producing-principle of life, and

one of the eight greater deities of Aegypt, and

represented under the form of a goat. It was

also one of the nomes assigned to that division

of the native army which was called the Calaairu,

and the city was celebrated for tire manufacture of

a perfume designated as the Mendesium unguentom.

(l'lin. xiii. 1. s. 2.) Mendes, however, declined

early, and disappears in the first century A. I*.;

since both Ptolemy {I.e.) and Aristidea (iii. p. 160)

mention Thmuis as the only town of note in the

Mendesian nome. From its position at the junc-tra

of the river and the lake, it was probably enmatcbed

upon by their waters, after the canals fell into

neglect under the Macedonian kings, and when they

were repaired by Augustus (Sueton. Aw;. 18, 65)

Thmuis had attracted its trade and population.

Ruins, however, supposed to be those of Mendes,

have been found near the hamlet of ArhmAn-Tanak
