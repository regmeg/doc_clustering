COIN OF I'RSO.

fRSOLAE or URSOU, a place in Gallia Nar-

onensis, fixed by the Antonine Itin. on the road

etween Valentia ( Valeacr) and Vienna ( Vienne),

iii. from Valentia, and xxvi. from Vienna, This

?rees pretty well with the whole distance between

'tilenct and Vienne. There are no means of de-

ennining the site of UrsoU exi-ept the distances;

nd D'Aoville fixes on S. Vtxlirr, a place on the

ight bank of the Galaure near the place where

t enters the Rhone. [G. I.. J

I'RUNCI, a place in Gallia between the Votget

nd the Rhine. It occurs twice in the Antonine

tin-, and in both cases the road from Urunci runs

□ Moris Brisiacus. [Moss Bkisiaccs.] In one

•ute it is placed between Larga (Laryitzen) and

Ions Brisiacus, xviii. from Larga, and xxiiii. from

trUiacu*. This route ia from south to north-east,

lie other route is from Arialbinnum, supposed to

e Binning near Baele, to Mous Brisiacus, from

mth to north, and Urunci is xxiii. M. P. or 15

■ujae from Mons Brisiacus. D'Anville supposes

hat Urunci may be a place named Kucten or Jticten,

n the line of the road from Larga to Mons Bri-

lacos or Breuack. [G. L.]

I'SAR.the most easterlyrirerof Mauretania- (l'lin.

. 2. s. 1.) It seems to be the river called iiaap

r Ptolemy (ir.2. § 10),and is probably the Ajtbby,

luich talis into the gulf of Bugie. [T. H. D.]

USARGALA (Oliaipya\a, PtoL nr. 6. § 7,

&c), a very extensive mountain chain in the conn-

try of the Garamantae on the N. border of Li­

bya Interior, and S. of Numidia and Mauretania,

stretching in a NW. direction as far as Atlas. It is

in this mountain that the river Bagradas has its

source. [T. H. D.]

U'SBIUM (O&rffioK), a town mentioned by Pto­

lemy (ii. II. $ 30) in the south-east of German ia,

probably in the territory of the Marcomanni, seems

to be identical with the modern Ispern, on a rivulet

of the same name. [L. S. j

US'CANA, the chief town of the Penestae, a peo­

ple of lllyricum. which contained 10.001 inhabitants

at the time of the Roman war with Perseus. At the

commencement of this war it appears to have been in

the hands of Perseus, and the first attempt of I he

Roman commander, App. Claudius, to obtain pos­

sesion of the place proved unsuccessful, B.C. 170.

(I.iv. iliii. 10 ) It would seem, however, to have

been afterwards taken by the Romans, since we read

that Perseus in the following year surprised Uscaua,

marching thither in three days from Stubera. (Liv.

xliii. 17, 18.) Shortly afterwards L. Coelius, the

Roman commander in lllyricum, made an unsuccessful

attack upon Uscana. (lb. 21.) The site of this

town is uncertain.

U'SCENUM (Ofcr«»KS»>, at OtoKairor, PtoL iii. 7.

§ 2), a town of the Jazyges Metanastae. [T.H.I).]

USCl'DAMA, a town belonging to the Bessi,

near Mount Haemus, which M. Lucullus took by

assault. (Eutr. vi. 10.) [J. R.]

USELLIS (Oftr«AAi», Ptol.: Utellut), a city of

Sardinia, situated in the interior of the island, about

16 miles from the Gulf of Orittano on the W. coast,

and the same distance S. of Forum Tnijani. Its

name is not found in the Itineraries, and the only

author who mentions it is Ptolemy (iii. 3. § 2), who

erroneously places it ou the W. coast of the island:

but the existing ruins, together with the name of

VstUat, still borne by a village on the site, leave no

doubt of its true situation. It is about 3 miles NE.

of the modern town of A let. Ptolemy styles it a

colonis, and this is confirmed by an inscription in

which it bears the title of " Colonia Julia Augusta."

It would hence appear probable that the colony must

have been founded under Augustus, though Pliny

tells us distinctly that Tunis Libyssonis was the

only colony existing in Sardinia in his time, (be

la Marmora, 1'oy. en Sardaiyne, vol. ii. pp. 367,

466.) [E.H. B.]

USILLA (OtfffAAo, PtoL iv. 3. § 10), a place

in Byzacium in Africa Proper. It is the Usula of

the Itin. Ant. (p. 59), lying between Thysdrui and

Thenae. Variouslv identified with Inchiila or Sidi

Uakelmf. and Inihillah. [T. H. D.]

USl'PETES or USl'PI (Oifffwrroi, 0*Vrnroi), a

German tribe, mostly mentioned in conjunction with

the Tencteri, with whom they for a long time shared

the same fate, until in the end, having crossed

the lower Rhine, they were treacherously attacked

and defeated by Julius Caesar. (Caes. B. G. iv. 4,

etc.; Appisn, de ltd). Call 18; comp. Tkxctkri.)

After this calamity, the Usipetes returned across the

Rhine, and were received by the Sigamhri, who as­

signed to them the district on the northern bank of

the Luppia, which had previously been inhabited by

the Chamavi and Tubantes, and in which we hence­

forth find the Usipetes as late as the time of Tacitus.

(Ann. xiii. 93, UitL iv. 37, Germ. 32; Dion Cass,

liv. 32, foil.) Afterwards the Usipetes are met with
