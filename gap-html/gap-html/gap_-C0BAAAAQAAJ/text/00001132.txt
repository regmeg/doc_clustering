tnre of the peristyle of the temple was adorned

wild sculpture, some remains of which have been

found among the ruins. North of the temple, and

nearly in a line with its eastern front, are founda­

tions of the Propylaeum or entrance into the sacred

peribolus: it was about 50 feet long and 30 broad,

ati'l presented at either eud a front of two Doric

columns between antae. utipporting a pediment. The

columns were 17 feet high, including the capital,

2 feet 10 inches in diameter at the base, with an

opening between them of 8 feet 8 inches." (The

Demi of Attica, p. 6.3. 2nd fed.) Leake remarks

that there are no traces of any third building visible,

and that we must therefore conclude that here, as

in the temple of Athena Polias at Athens, Poseidon

was honoured only with an aha:', Wordsworth,

however, remarks that a little to the NK. of the

peninsula on which the temple stands is a conical

hill, where are extensive vestiges of an ancient

building, which may perhaps be the remains of the

temple of Poseidon. (Athens and Attica, p. 207.)

SUN0NEXS1S LACUS, a hike in Bithynia,

Infiween the Ascania Lacus and the river Sangarius.

(Amm. Marc. xxvi. S.) It i.s probably the same

lake which is mentioned by Evagrius (Hist. Eccl.

ii. 14) under the name of Boatr; K\p.vq in the neigh­

bourhood of Nicomedeia, and which is at present

known under the name of Shabanja. It seems, also,

to be the same lake from which the younger Pliny

(x. 50) proposed to cut a canal to the sea. [L. S.]

SUPERAEQUUM or SUPEREQUL'M (Elh.

Supcraequanus: CasUl Veccnio Subequo), & town of

the Peligni, one of the three which (jossesved mu­

nicipal rights, and among which the territory of that

j>e-»ple was divided. [Pelignl] Hence it is men­

tioned both by Pliny and in the Liber Coioniaruin,

where it is termed *' Colouia Superueuuana." It

received a colony of veterans, probably under Au­

gustus, to which a fresh body of colonists was added

in the reign ot M. Aurelius. (I'liu. iii. 12. s. 17;

Lib. Colon, p. 229; Zumpt, de Colon, p. 361.) '1 lie

name is not mentioned by any other author, but

several inscriptions attest its municipal importance.

Its she, which was erroneously transferred by Clu-

verius to Palcna, was clearly fixed by Holstcnius

at a place still called CasUl Vecchh Subequo (in

older documents Subropto or Subreyo), when.' the

inscriptions alluded to are still extant. It is situated

on a hill on the right bank of the Aternus. and about

4 miles on the left of the Via Valeria. Its terri­

tory probably comprised the hilly district between that

road and the Aternus. (CIliver, Ital.p. 758; Holsten.

SU'PPARA (Zovmrapa, Peripl. M. E. c. 52, ed.

at no great distance from Barygaza or Beroach.

Ptolemy calls it 'Xovwdpa (vii. I. § 6). In Lassen's

map it is placed on the left bank of the Tapati or

Ma nag una, not far to the X, of Surat. This place

i.s also mentioned by Edrisi (i. p. 171), and by Cos-

mas Indicopieustes under the form of 'OfyaOk (p.

337, ed. Montfauc). It has been suspected, with

much reason, by Henley, that this is the " Ophir " of

the Bible,— the name in Sanscrit and Hebrew re­

spectively offering some remarkable analogies. (Ben-

ley, art. Initial, in Ertch and Grubvrt p. 2S.) [V.]
