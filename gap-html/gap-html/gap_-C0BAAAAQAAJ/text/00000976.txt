that Oinri built, it merely as a palatial residence

(Sinai and Palestine, p. 240); but Dr. Robinson

l*rhuptj more just 1 j concludes that it was chosen as

the site of the capital, and remarks that " it would

h* difficult to find in all Palestine a situation

of equal strength, fertility, and beauty combined."

{Bihl. Res. iii. p. 146.) Its great strength is at­

tested by the fact that it endured a siege from all

the jjower of the Syrian army under Hazael, in the

days of Jehoram (cir. B.C. 892), little more than

30 years after its first foundation, and was not taken

notwithstanding the frightful effects of the famine

within the walls (2 Kittys, vii. 24—viii. 20); and

when subsequently besieged by the Assyrians (cir.

j;. c. 721) it was only reduced after a siege of three

yours (xviii. 9, 10). After the captivity it was taken

by John Hyrcanus, after a year's siege, when he is

said to have sapped the foundations of it with water

and destroyed all traces of a city. It was subse­

quently occupied by the Jews until Pompey restored

it to its owu inhabitants. It was further restored

by Gabinius. (Joseph. Ant. xiii. 10. § 3, 15. § 4,

siv. 4. § 4, 5. § 3, xiii. 10. § 3, 15. §4.) It was

granted to Herod the Great by Augustus on the

death of Antony and Cleopatra, and was by him con­

verted into a Roman city under the name of Sebaste

—Augusta, in honour of his imperial patron. {Ant.

xv. 3. 3, 7, 8. § 5, B. J. i. i>0. § 3.) The town

was surrounded with a wall 20 stadia in length; in

the middle of the town was a temple built in honour

of Caesar, itself of large dimensions, and standing in

a tcinenos of I.J stadium square. It was colonised

with 6000 veterans and others, to whom was as­

signed an extremely fertile district around the city.

{B. J. i. 21. § 2.) Dr. Robinson imagines that it

was in this city that Philip first preached the Gos­

pel, and that the church was founded by the apostles

St. Peter and St. John {Acts, viii, 5, &c); but con-

sidering the absence of the article in the original,

supplied in the English translation, and comparing

the passage with the identical expression in St. John

(iv. 5), it is more probable that the same town is in­

tended, viz. Sychar, or Neapolis, the chief seat of

the Samaritan worship. Nor does the expression in

Acts (viii, 14), that "Samaria had received the word

of God," militate against this view; for here also the

country may be very well understood, and it is well

remarked by Dr. Robinson that u it is sometimes

difficult to distinguish whether, under the name Sa­

maria, the city or the region is meant." {Bill. Re$.

iii. p. 146.) It is most probable, however, that the

sacred writers would have used the classical name

then in vogue had they had occasion to mention the

city. Sepiimius Sevcrus placed a clony there in the

beginning of the third century (Ulpian, quoted by

Kubinson, I. c. p 148, n. 1), and it was probably at

that time an episcopal see; for its bishop, Marius or

Marinus, was present at the Council of Nicaea and

subscribed its acts. (Le Quien, Orient Ckristianus,

vol. iii. col. 549—552.) The tradition which as­

signs Sebaste as the place of St. John Baptist's im­

prisonment and martyrdom is first found in St. Je­

rome (Comment in Osee, i. 5). who also places there

the tombs of Obadiah and Elisha {Comment in Ab-

dtam, i. 1, Epitaph. Pauhte, c. 6), and militates

against Joseph us, whose statement, however, is inad­

missible. [Maciiakiu's.] The modern village

which represents in its name and site the magnificent

city of Herod the Great is situated on an isolated

lull 6 milei N. of Nablus, reckoned by Josephus

a day's journey from Jeru>aletu. {Ant. xv. 11.)

The village occupies only th* eisttra itrrrrtt

of the hill, and stands at the beL'Uuf »to ?26

feet above the sea. Its only o)n.>pico*is acj*-:: a
