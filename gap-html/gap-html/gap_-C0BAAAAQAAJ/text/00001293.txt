TIGRIS. TILURIUM.

r*in* to the SW., it completely unites with that

iver, at a place called by Pliny {I. c.) Digha, 1000

itidia above their common embouchure in the

VrMan gulf. Many of the ancients were aware that

be two rivers joined one another, and had a com-

n.-ti mouth (Plin. to.; Strab. ii. p. 79; Procop.

?. P. i. 17, &c), whilst others were of opinion that

be Euphrates had a separate embouchure (Onesi-

rirot, qp. Strnb. xv. p. 729; Arrian, A nab. I.e.;

iad /net 41; Nearch. p, 37, Huds.). But even

Ii — who recognised their junction were not agreed

*tn which stream it was that received the other,  
fvi whether their united course, now the Skat-el-

tni/i, xliould I* called Tigris or Euphrates. Must

inter* adopted the former name, but Nenrchus and

^nicritus preferred that of the Euphrates (cf.

in*ri, indie, 41). It is not impossible, however,

f it the Euphrates may at one time have h.-id a

'pnratemonth (cf. Plin. I c; Ritter, Erdk. x. p. 27).

here was also a difference of opinion ns to the

imlier of mouths by which the united stream

mftiad itaelf into the Persian gulf. Its western

ulhs were entirely unknown to the ancient

-■••cks, m Antiochus Epiphane* was the first who  
uw*l the cttist to the \V. of the Tigris to be

rrnrstery surveyed; and amongst later conquerors,

'njin alone penetrated ns far as this neighbour'

nod. Hence the ancient Greeks, as well as Pliny

\.c.\ apeak of only one mouth, the breadth of

tieo is given by the latter at 10 miles. Ptolemy,

owever, mentions two mouths (vi. 3. § 2) at a

•lance tif \ \ degrees apart, which is confirmed by

•mwcritua (ap. Phila-torg. Hist. Eccl. iii. 7, 8),

«*>iing to whom the island between these mouths

inhabited by the Meseni. But probably by the

*-r?rn mouth was meant that of the river Eulaeus,

* jirewn; Karun, one arm of which unites with  
** Tigris, whilst the other falls into the sea by an  
iflVpendent nvwth. This river was also called

vitigris by the ancients (Jlaairtypts, Strab. xv. p.

29), that is, w the little Tigris," from the old

rrvAn word pas, Mgnifying " small;" whence also

the modern Persians it bears the name of

•i-ijiahi-Kudal; which means the same thing,

ewe we may explain how the united stream of

»t Tigris and Euphrates itself was throughout its

nrw called Pasitigris by some writers (Strab. /. c;

da. I e,); whiUt others regarded the Pasitigris as

rite a separate stream, rising in the territory of

* Uxii, and disemboguing into the Persian gulf  
winn. ap. Strab. 1. c; Arrian, fnd. 42; Diodor.

'ii. 67; Curt t. 3, init). This last view would

»ke it Identical with the present Karun (cf

!';rwir, Mem. p. 59; Gosselin, Recherches, <ft\ ii.

86, sqq; Vincent, Peript. iii. p. 67, not. Ac),

be other affluents of the Tigris were the Nice-

-nm or Centritis, the Zabatus or Lycus, the  
'irrudu*. the Ciiprus, the Tornadolus or Torna,

ijatrmtly the same as the Physcus of Xenophon

tmb. ii. 4. § 25). the Gyndes or Delas, the

'oaspea, and the Coprates, which fell into the

•in stnaio after joining the Eulaeus. All these

-r* were on the left or eastern bank of the Tigris.  
> stream of the Tigris was very rapid, and

•^ordrajr to Strabo (p. 529) from its very source;

Pliny (£. c.) more correctly ascribes this

tiiilT only to it* lower course. It was, in fact,

mg to the large quantity of water which the

jris received by means of the canals which

-nected it with the Euphrates, none of which was  
turned through the same channel*, owing to the

bed of the Tigris being at a lower level. (Arrian,

/. c; Dion Cuss, lxviii. 28; Slrab. /. c; Hor. Od. iv.

14, 46; Lncan, iiL 256, &c.) In ancient times

many dams had been constructed in its course from

Opis to its mouth, designed to retain its waters for

the purpose of irrigating the adjoining districts

(cf. Heeren, Jdeen, i. 2. p. 171; Tavcrnicr, Voyage*,

i. p. 185; Niebuhr, Jteise, ii. p. 243). These,how­

ever, were all cut through by Alexander, in order

to improve the navigation, which began as high up

as Opis (Arrian, L r.; Strab. 739, sq.) Between

Mogul and the confluence of the greater Zab, and

3 hours'journey above the latter, there still remains

an ancient dam of masonry thrown across the stream

TIGUADKA, a small Wand off the coast of

Spain, opposite the town of Palina, in the island of

Balearis Major. (Plin. iii. 5. s. 11.) [T. H. D.]

TIGUKINUS PAGUS. [Hklvktxi.]

TILADAE (TiAtfcu, Ptol. vii. 2. § 15), a race

who lived under the, Mons Maeandrus in Western

India. They are probably the same as the Taluctae

of Pliny (vi.* 19. s. 22). [Taujctak.] [V.]

TILAVKMPTUS(TiAoov#m*t«: Tagliauunto),

a river of Venetia, which has ita sources in the

Alps, above 80 miles from the sea, and after tra­

versing the broad plain of the Frwui% falls into the

Adriatic sea between Aquileia and Concordia.

(Plin. iii. 18. s. 22; Ptol. iii. 1. § 2G.) It is the

most considerable rirer in this |«rt of Italy, and,

like all the neighbouring rivers, is subject to be

swollen by floods and winter rains, so that it leaves

a broad bed of shingle, great part of which is dry

at ordinary seasons. The name is found in Pliny

and Ptolemy; and it is doubtless the same river

which is described by Strabo, though without men­

tioning its name, as separating the territory of

Aquileia from the province of Vewtia, and which

he says was navigable for 1200 stadia from its

mouth. (Strab. v. p. 214.) This last statement

is indeed a great exaggeration; but the valley of

the Tagliamento is one of the natural openings of

this part of the Alps, and was followed by the line

of a Roman road, which proceeded from Aquileia

by Julium Carnicum {Zugtio) over the jiass of the

Monte di Sta Croce into the valley of the Gail.

[Aumcn, p. 110.]

Pliny speaks (l c.) of a "Tilaventnm tnajus

minusque," but it is impossible to say what river ho

meant to designate under the latter appellation.

The name is written in the Tabula 44 Tiliabinte,"

while it assumes very nearly its modern form in tho

Geographer of Ravenna. (Taliainentnm, Geogr.

Rav. iv. 36.) [E. II. B.]

TILENE, in Gallia. The name is Kile in the

Table, or Filena as some say. D'Anville altered it

to Tilene, and he finds the place on a road in the

Table from Audomatunum (Ijangres) to Cahil-

lonum (ChaUonstiT'Sadne). The place is Tti-le-

Chdteau, tho Tile Castrutn of the eleventh century.

Some documents of that time have Tiricastnim and

Tricastel, and accordingly the place is vulgarly

called Tre-chateau or Tri-chdteau. [<5. L.]
