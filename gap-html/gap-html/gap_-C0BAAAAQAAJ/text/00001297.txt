+\rn that it was besieged without success by the

traders of the Italian forces during the Social War.

[Diod. xxxvii. Exc. Phot p. 240.) On both occa-

4c<u it appears as a strong fortress, situated appa-

• y in the neighbourhood of Khegium; but no

aJwr mention is found of the city, which is not no-

.cnl by any of the geographers, and must probably

lave ceased to exist, like ao many of the smaller

uwu of Bruttium. The name is, however, found in

*ti>phanua of Byzantium, who confirms the correct-  
*** of the form Ti-i.i found in Appian. (Steph.  
J. a, v.) It* site is wholly uncertain. [E. H. B.]

TISSA (TiVo-o, Plot; TWa*, Steph. B.: Eth,

r^ffaTot, Tissiensis, Cic, Tissinensis, Plin.), a town

l the interior of Sicily, repeatedly mentioned by an-

mbI authors, but without any clue to its position.

K% its name is cited from Philistus by Stephanus of

irzantiam (s. v. ). it must have existed as a Siculian

j»n from an early period, but its name is not found

n history. Under the Iiomans it continued to Bub­

al as a municipal town, though a vory small place.

Cicero calls it "perparva et tenuis civitas, and

nlitu Italic us also terms it " pan'o nomine Tisse."'

Cic Vtrr. iii. 38; StL Ital. xiv. 267.) It is again

uXiced by Pliny and Ptolemy among the towns of

W interior of Sicily, bat all trace of it is tubee-

■jently lost. The only clue to its site is derived

win Ptolemy, who places it in the neighbourhood of

Letua. It has been fixed by Oluverius and others

n the site of the modem town of Hantlazzot nt the

wrthern foot of Aetna, but this is a mere conjecture.

. e.: Eth, TitcUcot), a place in the Sicyonia, upon

he left bank of the Asopus, distant GO stadia from

ikyuB, and 40 from Phlius. It was situated upon

i* summit of a hill, where Titan, the brother of

.'if Son, is said to hare dwelt, and to have given

iii name to the spot. It was celebrated for a temple

if Asclepius, reported to have been built by Alex-

■sder, the son of Machaon, the son of Asclepius.

temple still existed in the time of Pauaanias,

I the middle of a grove of cypress trees, in which

be tenants of the god attended to the patients who

tine thither for the recovery of their health.

■ ";i the temple stood statues of Asclepins and

frpeia, and of the heroes Alexanor and Kuamerion.

'here was also a temple of Athena at Titane, situ-

'■■■j upon a hill, and cunt lining an ancient wooden

■jtue of the goddess. In descending from the hill

hens was an altar of the Winds. (Paus. ii. 11. §§

—8, ii. 12. § 1, ii. 27. § 1.) Stephanus B.

e.) refers the TitoVoio' t« Acu*a Kapriva of

lumer (//. ii. 735) to Titane, but those words in-

irate a mountain in Thessaly. [Vol. I. p. 248, b.]

"be ruins of Titane were first discovered by Ross.

*ake heard that there were some ancient foun-  
aiiona on the summit of the hill above Liopesi,

rtiieh be supposed to be the remains of the temple

'Aselepiua at Titane; but although Hellenic

eroaiins exist at this site, there can be no doubt

bat Titane is represented by the more important

'<u'6ka*tr<m situated further S., and a few minutes

i. of the village of Voicvnda. This PuU6kastron

linos upon a projecting spur of the mountains

'hich run eastward towards the Asopus, and ter­

minate just above the river in a small hill, which

■ -□rn.un.ltil by beautiful Hellenic walls, rising to

he heiglit of 20 or 30 ft. on the S. and SW. side,

and flanked by three or four quadrangular towers.

On this hill there stands a chapel of St. Tryphon,

containing fragments of Doric columns. This ma

evidently the acropolis of the ancient city, and here

stood the temple of Athena mentioned by Pausanias.

The other parts of this projecting ridge are covered

with ancient foundations; and upon this part of the

mountain the temple of Asclepius must have stood.

a frontier town of Phocis, on the side of Doris. Livy,

who calls it Tritonon, describes it as a town of Doris

(xxviii. 7), but all other writers place it in Phocis.

It was destroyed by the army of Xerxes together

with the other Phocian towns. It is placed by Pau­

aanias in the plain at the distance of 15 stadia from

Amphicleia. The site of Tithronium is probably in­

dicated by some ruins at Mulki below Ytrrzami, where

a torrent unites with the Cephissus. (1 It-rod. vih.

TITULCIA, a town of the Carps tani in His-

Cacsaraugusta (/(ak Ant. pp. 436, 438, &c.) It

seems to be the same town called TiTowuna by

Ptolemy (ii. 6. § 57). Variously placed near Tor-

rejon, at Getafe, and at liayona. [T. II. D.]

TITVKUS (Tiruoot, Strab.x. p. 479), a moun­

Upon it was the sanctuary or temple called Die-

the headland also called Tityrus (Stadiatm. p. 302)

T1US or TIUM (Tlos or Tfor: Eth. Tau>6s), a

town on the coast of Bithynia, or, according to others,

belonging to Paphlagonia. It was a Greek tarn

situated at the mouth of the river Billaeus, and

seems to have belonged to Paphlagonia uutil Prusias

annexed it to Bithynia. (Meinnon, 17—19; Pomp.

Mela, i. 19; Marcian, p. 70; Arrian, PeripL P. E.

p. 14; Anon. PeripL P. E. p. 2.) In Strabo's (xii.

pp. 542, 543, 565) time, Tins was only a small

place but remarkable as the birthplace of Philctse-

rua, the founder of the royal dynasty of Pergammn.

(Comp. Plin. vi. 1.) There are coins of Ttai as late

as the reign of Gallieuus, on which the ethnic name

appears as Tutvot, Tetbi, and Ttu&oi. (Sestiui,
