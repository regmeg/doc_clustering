~»-»rian river Saron is also mentioned (Euatatb.

■4 KslNA (JLipatra, Strab.: Eth. Sarsinas: Sar-

it. a crlv of Umbria, situated in the Apennines,

1 a- kft bank of the river Sapis (Saviu), about

r ,a above Caeeena. It seems to have leen in

f early linw a powerful and important city, as

art cam* to the tribe of the Sarsinates CSapai-

„, put). wbo were one of the most considerable

it I'raurian tribes. Indeed some authors speak

taea as if they were not included in the Urn-

all, but fiirmed a separate tribe with

rot national character. Thus Polybius,

jrur the farces of the Italian nations,

iu of the Umbriana and Sarsinates, and Flautua,

in one passage, makes a similar distinction.' (Pnl. ii.

24; Plant. Motte.lL iii. 2. 83.) The Fasti Capito-

lini, also, in recording the conquest of the Sarsinates,

speak of the two consuls as triumphing " de Sarsi-

natibus," without any mention of the Umbrians;

but the Epitome of Livy, in relating the same event,

classes them generally among the Umbrians. (Liv.

Epit. xv.; Fast. Capit.) The probable conclusion is

that they were a tribe of the Umbrian race; but

with a separate political organisation. We have no

particulars of the war which ended in their subjec­

tion, which did not take place till B. c. 2*56, so that

they were one of the last of the Italian states that

submitted to the Roman yoke. From this time

Sarsina was certainly included in Umbria in the

Roman sense of the term, and became an ordinary

municipal town, apparently not of much importance.

(Strab. v. p. 227; Plin. iii. 14. s. 19.) It derived

its chief celebrity from its being the birthplace of

the celebrated comic poet Plautus, who was bora

there about B. c 254, very shortly after the Roman

conquest. (Hieron. Chron. ad 01. 145; Fest. ». v.

Plotiu, p. 238.) Its territory contained extensive

mountain pastures, — whence it is called by Silius

Italicus " dives lactis" (Sil. Ital. viii. 461),—as well

as forests, which abounded in dormice, so much

prized by the Romans. (Martial, iii. 58. 35.) Va­

rious inscriptions attest the municipal rank of Sar-

sina under the Roman Empire (Orell. Inscr. 4404;

Gruter, Inter, p. 522. 8, p. 1095. 2); but its name

is not a^ain found in history. In the middle ages

it sunk into complete decay, but was revived in the

13th century, and is now a small town of 3000 in­

habitants, which retains the ancient site as well as

name. [E. H. B.]

SABTA (2d>rn, Herod, vii. 122; Steph. B. t. r.),

a maritime town on the Singitic gulf between

Singus and Ampelus Prom; now Kartali. (Leake,

North. Greece, vol. iii. p. 154.) [E. B. J.]

•SARUE'NA (Sopotsnra), a town of Cappadocia,

in the district Chamane or Chamanene, on the north­

eastern slope of Mount Argaeus, celebrated for its

hot springs (Ptol. v. 6. § 12; Tab. Peut., where

it is called Arauena, whence Aquae Arauenae; It.

Ant. p 202, where its name is Sacoena). It is by

some believed to be the modern Batlyan. [L. S.]

SARUNE'TES.the name of an Alpine people (I'lin.

iii. 20. s. 24) in the valley near the sources of the

Rhine. There seems no reason to doubt the correct­

ness of the name, and it may be preserved in Sargant,

which is north of Chur, and between Chw and the

Lake of Constant. In a passage of Caesar (B.G. iv.

10) he mentions the Nantuates as a people in the

upper part of the Rhine, above the Helvetji. Tho

name Nantuates [Nabtuatks] is corrupt; and it is

possible that the name Sarunetes should be in its

place. [G. L.]

SARUS (Sapor), one of the principal rivers in tho

south-east of Asia Minor, having its sources in Mount

Taurus in Cataonia. It first flows in a houth-

eastern direction through Cappadocia by the town of

Comana; it then passes tlmnieh Cilicia in a south­

western direction, and, after flowing by the town of

Adana, empties itself into the Cilician sea, on tho

south of Tarsus, after dividing itself into several

branches. (Liv. xxziii. 41.) According to Xenoplmn

(Anab. i.4. § 1) its breadth at its mouth was 3 pletbra

or 300 feet; and Frocopius (de Aedif. v. 4) i-avs

it was a navigable river. (Comp. Strab. xii. p. 535;
