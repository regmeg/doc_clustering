r .-mains of the town stand directly under the

at Castellan in the diocese of Senez in the Maritime

Alps, where there are salt springs, and where Spoil's

inscription is said to have been found. D'Anville

places it at Seillaru in the diocese of Frejus, near

Faventia (Fayence); and he observes that all the old

towns of this country preserve their names. (D'An­

ville, Notice, <fe.; Ukert, Gallien. p. 438.) [G. L]

SALI'NAE (ZaAiVai, Ptol. ii. 3. § 21), a town

of the Catyeuchlani or Capelani, towards the E.

coast of Britannia Romans. Camden (p. 339)

identifies it with Salndy or Sandye, near Potion in

Bedfordshire; others have sought it in the S. part

of Lincolnshire. [T. H. D.]

SALI'NAE (2o\r«u, Ptol. iii. 8. § 7; Peut.

there are Roman remains. (Comp. Paget, Hungary

SALI'NUM (2a\ivov), a place on the right bank

of the Danube, a little below Aquincum, on the road

from this town to Mursa in Lower Pannonia. (Ptol.

ii. 16. § 4; /(. Ant. p. 245, where it is called Vctus

Salina.) On the Pent. Table we find in that spot

the corrupt name Vetusalium. Its site must hare

been in the neighbourhood of the modem Banna-

bek. [L. S.]

SALIOCANUS. [Stauocandb.]

SALIOCLITA, in Gallia, is placed by the An­

tonine Itin. on the road from Genabum {Orleans)

to Lutetia {Paris). It is Saclas, a little south of

Etampes, on the Juine, a branch of the Seme. The

Itin. makes the distance the same from Gennbuin,

and Lutetia, which we must take to be La Cite

de Paris; but there is an error in the Itin., as

D'Anville shows, in the distance from Salioclita to

Lutetia, and he proposes to correct it. [G. L.]

SALISSO, in north Gallia, is placed by the An­

tonine Itin. on a road from Augusta Trevirorum

{Trier) to Bingium {Bmgen). The places reck­

oned from Augusta are Bamiobrica xviiu, Sali.-*o

xxii, Bingium xxiii. This Baudobrica is not the

place described under the article Bauuoiikica

{Boppart). These 63 Gallic leagues exceed the rt-al

distance from Trier to Bingen considerably. The

site of Salisso is uncertain. [G. L.]

SALMA'NTICA (2oA^»dVT.*a, Ptol. ii 5. § 9;

Strat. viii. 48, ZaApa-ns), an important town of

the Vet tunes in Lusitania, on the S. Lank of the

Durius, on the road from Emerita to Caesaraugusta.

It is incontestibly identical with the 'EA/jamirrf of

Polybius (iii. 14). and the ilermandiea or Helman-

tica of Livy (xxi. 5; cf. Nonius, Hisp. c. 38). It

is the celebrated modern town of Salamanca, where

the piers of a bridge of twenty-seven arches over the

Torrnes, built by Trajan, are still in existence. (Cf.

Mifiauo, Diccion. rii. p. 402; Florez, Ksp. Sagr.
