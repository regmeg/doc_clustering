vilest of the Roman prostitutes. (Senec. Hoi. vi.

32; Plin. sxi. G.) The account given by Servius

of tins statue lets been the subject of much dis­

cussion, into which the limits of this article will

not permit us to cuter. The whole question lias been

exhausted by Creuzer. {Stud. ii. p. 282, seq.; cf.

JSavigny, Gesck. d<s Rum. RecJUs, i. 52.)

Near the rostra were also the statues (if the Turku

Sibyls (Plin. xxxiv. II), which are apparently

the same as the three Wlotptu or Fates, mentioned

by Procopius. (/>. Goth. i. 25.) These also were

lit the head of the forum, towards the temple of

Janus, a position which points to the same result as

the Duilian column with respect to the situation of

the coinitium.

Livy's description of a great fire which broke

out about the forum B.c. 211 afVords some topo­

graphical particulars: "Intermpit hos sermones

node, quae pridie Qulnquatrus fuit, pluribus simul

locis circa forum incendium ortum. Eodera tem­

pore septem Tabernae, quae posten quinque, et

argentariae, quae nunc Novae appellantur, nrsere.

Comprehensa r>istea privata aedificia, ncque enim

turn basilicae erant: comprehensae Lautumiae, fo-

rumque piseatorium, et atrium regium. Aedis Vestae

vis defensa est" (xxvi. 27). As the fire, wilfully

occasioned, broke out in several places, and as the

Curia Hostilia does not seem to have been en­

dangered, we may perhaps conclude that the Septem

Tabernae here mentioned were on the 8. side of the

forum. The argentariae afterwards called Novae

were undoubtedly on the N. side, and, for the reason

just given, they perhaps lay to the K. of the curia,

as the fire seems to have spread to the eastward.

It was on the N. side that the greatest damage was

done, as the tire here spread to the Lautumiue and

f orum Piseatorium. The Septem Tabernae appear

to have been the property of the state, as they were

rebuilt by the censors at the public expense, together

with tin' fish-market and Atrium Regium (" Loca-

verunt inde refieienda quae circa forum incendio

consumpta erant, septan, tabernas, marellum, atrium

regitim," Id xxvii. 11). This passage would seem

to >how that the reading quintptc (tabernae) in that

previously cited is corrupt. Muretus has observed

that one codex has "quae postea rrf.,*1 which in

other* was contracted into v., and thus taken for a

numeral, (Becker, Handb. p. 297, notes). Hence

we may infer that the Veteres Tabernae on the S.

side ot the forum were seven in number, and from

the word po.-tett applied to them, whilst nunc is

us»'d of the Novae, it might perhaps be inferred

that the distinctive appellation of Veteres did not

conic into use till after this accident.

It also appears from this passage, that there were

no basiliiae at Home at this period. It was not

long afterwards, however, namely it. c. 184, that

the first ofthe.se buildinjrs was founded by M. Por-

cius Cato in his censorship, and called after him

B vsii.ica PoticiA. In order to procure the requisite

ground, Cato purchased the houses of Maenius and

I it ins in the Lautumiae, and four tabernae, (Liv.

xxxix 44.) Hence we may infer that the Laulu-

niiae lay close at the back of the forum; which also

appears from the circumstance that Maenius. when

1"' sold his house, reserved for himself one of its

columns, with a balcony on the top, in order that he

and his posterity might lie able to view from it the

gladiatorial shows on the for am. (Ps. Ascon. ad
