it was not permitted for intermarriages to take

jlice between any of these classes, nor for any one to

perform the office allotted to another, except in the case

of the first caste (called also that of the $>iAiwo(pof)(

to which class a man might be raised from any of the

father classes. (Strab. I.e.; Arrian, Ind. c. 12; Diod.

ii. 41; Plin. vi. 19. s. 22.) We may remark that the

ni-.*Jern writers on India recognise only four castes,

called respectively Brahman*, Kshatryas, Vaisyas,

ami Sudmsr — a division which Heeren has suggested

(we think without sufficient evidence) to indicate the

remains of distinct races. (AtiaL Nat. vol. ii. p. 220.)

The lowest of the people (now called Pariahs), as

belonging to none of the above castes, are nowhere

dbtinctly mentioned by ancient writers (but cf. Strab.

xv. p 709; Diod. ii. 29; Arrian,Ind. c. 10).

The general description of the Indians, drawn from

MegaAthenes and others who had lived with them, is

very pleasing. Theft is said to have been unknown,

so itiat houses could be left unfastened. (Strab. xv.

ju 709.) No Indian was known to speak falsehood.

(.Strab. L e.; Arrian, Ind. c. 12.) They were ex­

tremely temperate, abstaining wholly from wine

(Strab. /. c),—their hatred of drunkenness being so

preat that any girl of the harem, who should see

the king drunk, was at liberty to kill him. (Strab.

xv. p. 710.) ilo class eat meat (Herod, iii. 100),

tbeir chief sustenance being rice, which afforded

them also a strong drink, i. e. arrak. (Strab. xv.

p. G94.) Hence an especial freedom from diseases,

and lone lives; though maturity was early developed,

especially in the female sex, girls of seven years old

hrin;; deemed marriageable. (Strab. xv. pp. 701—

706; Arrian, Jnd. 9.) The women are said to have

been remarkable for their chastity, it being impas­

sible to tempt them with any smaller gifts than that

of an elephant (Arrian, Ind. c. 17), which was not

considerwl discreditable by their countrymen; and

the usual custom of marriage was for the father to

take his daughters and to give them in marriage to

tb- youths who had distinguished themselves most

in gymnastic exercises. (Arrian, L c.; Strab. xv.

ft 717.) To strangers they ever showed the utmost

hospitality. (Diod. ii. 42.) As warriors they were

notorious (Arrian, Ind. c. 9; Exped. Alex. v. 4;

Pint. Alex. c. 59, 63): the weapons of the foot-

aoWiers being bows and arrows, and a great two-

handed sword ; and of the cavalry, a javelin and a

round shield (Arrian, Ind. c. 16; Strab. xv. p. 717;

Curt. viii. 9.) In the Panjdb, it is said that the

Macedonians encountered poisoned arrows. (Diod.

srii. 103.) Manly exercises of all kinds were in

vogue among them. The chase was the peculiar

privilege of royalty (Strab. xv. pp. 709—712 ; Ctes.

Ind. 14; Curt. viii. 9, seq.); gymnastics, music, and

dancing, of the rest of the people (Strab. xv. p. 709;

A-riaa, Exp. Alex. vi. 3); and juggling and slight

of hand wrre then, as now, among their chief amuse­

ments. (Aelian, viii. 7; Juven. vi. 582.) Their

usual dress befitted their hot climate, and was of

white Snen (Philost. Vit. A poll. ii. 9) or of cotton-

stuff (Strab. xv. p. 719; Arrian, Ind. c. 16); their

bead* and shoulders partially covered (Arriau, /. c;

Curt viii 9, 15) or shaded from the sun by um-

DRiks (Arrian, L c.); with shoes of white leather,

with very thick and many-coloured soles. (Arrian,

£ t) Gold and ivory rings and ear-rings were in

common use; and they were wont to dye their beards,

not only black and white, but also red and green.

(Arrian, /. c.) In general form of body, they were

thin and elegantly made, with great litheness (Ar­

rian, Ind. c. 17; Strab. ii. p. 103, xv. p. 695), but

were larger than other Asiatics. (Arrian, Exped.

Alex. v. 4; Plin. vii. 2.)

Some peculiar customs they had, which have lasted

to thepresent day, such as self-immolation by water or

fire, and throwing themselves from precipices (Strab.

xv. pp.716, 718; Curt. viii.9; Arrinn,Exped. Alex.

vii. 5; Lucan. iii. 42; Plin.vi. 19.8.20), and the burn­

ing of the widow (suttee); not, indeed, agreeably to

any fixed law, but rather according tocustom. (Strab.

xv. pp. 699—714: Diod. xvii. 91, xix. 33; Cic.

Tusc. Disp. v. 27.) For writing materials they

used the bark of trees (Strab. xv. p. 717; Curt. ix.

15), probably much as the modem Cinghalese use

the leaf of the palm. Their houses were generally

built of wood or of the bamboo-cane; but in the cold

mountain districts, of clay. (Arrian, Ind. c. 10.)

It is a remarkable proof of the extent to which

civilisation had been carried in ancient India, that

there were, throughout great part of the country,

high roads, with stones set up (answering to our

milestones), on which were inscribed the name of

the place and the distance to the next station.

IN'DICUS OCEANUS (o 'Irtutto dtfcortfr,

Agath, it. 14; to *\vhiK\iv iriKayos, Ptol. vii. 1. § 5).

The Indian Ocean of the ancients may be considered

generally as that great sea which washed the whole

of the southern portion of India, extending from the

parallel of longitude of the mouths of the Indus to

the shores of the Chersonesus Aurea. It seems, in­

deed, to have been held by them as part, however, of

a yet greater extent of water, the limits of which

were undefined, at least to the southwards, and to

which they gave the generic name of the Southern

Sea. Thus Herodotus speaks of tj vorin SdAaaaa

in this sense (iv. 37), as does also Strabo (ii. p. 121);

Diodorus calls it y Kara fMawpGpiai' u>K(cu>6s (iii

38), while the Erythraean sea, taken in its most

extended meaning, doubtless conveyed the same

sense. (Herod, ii. 102, iv. 37; compared with Strab.

i. p. 33.) Ptolemy gives the distances across this

sea as stated by seafaring men; at the same time he

guards against their over-statements, by recording

his opinion in favour of no more than one-third of

their measurements: this space he calls 8670 stadia

(i. 13. § 7). The distance along its shores, follow­

ing the indentations of the coast-line, he estimates,

on the same authority, at 19,000 stadia. It is

evident, however, that Ptolemy himself had no clear

idea of the real form of the Indian Ocean, and that

he inclined to the opinion of Hipparchus, Polybius,

and Marinus of Tyre, that it was a vast inland sea,

the southern portion of it being bounded by the slmrcs

of an unknown land which he supposed to connect Cut -

tigara in the Chersonesus Aurea with the promontory

of Prasum (now Cape Delgado) in Africa (comp. iv.

9. §§ 1,3, vii. 3. §§ 1,3, 6). The origin of this error

it is not easy now to ascertain, but it seems to have

been connected with one which is found in the his­

torians of Alexander's expedition, according to which

there was aconnection between thelndusand the Nile,

so that the sources of the Acesines (Chendb) were

confounded with those of the Nile. (Arnan, vi. 1.)

Strabo, indeed, appears to have had some leaning to

a similar view, in that he connected the Erythraean

with the Atlantic sea (ii. p. 130); which was also
