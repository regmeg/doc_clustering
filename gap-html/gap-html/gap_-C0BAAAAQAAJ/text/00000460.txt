topographers, and three or four localities have boon

proposed. ()f these, Scaton and //emoiiry, near

Jfoniton, appear to have the best claims fur consi­

deration ; but as the stations next to large towns

were often merely establishments for relays <■(" horses

and other purposes connected with posting, they

wore the least likely to he constructed on a large or

substantial scale; and thus we have often great diffi­

culty in detecting even a vestige of them. [C. II. S.]

MORI'MKXE (Mopi/«wf). a district in the north­

west of Cuppadocia, comprising both banks of the

river Halys, is said to have been tit only for pasture |

land, to have had scarcely any fruit-trees, and to i

have abounded in wild asses. (Strab. xii. pp. 534, j

537, 539, 540; Plin. //. .V. vi. 3.) The Romans |

regarded it as a part of Galatia, whence Ptolemy

(v. 6) does not mention it among the districts of

Cappadocia. [L. S.J

MO'RINI, a nation of Bclgica. Virgil is the au­

thority for the quantity; —

"Extremique hominum Morini." (Aen. viii. 727.)

It has been shown in the article Mknapii that

on the north the Morini were hounded by the Menapii. j

On the west the ocean was the boundary, and on!

the south the Ambiani and the At rebates. The ,

eastern boundary cannot be so easily determined.!

The element of Morini seems to be tin; word mor,

the sea, which is a common Flemish word still, and:

also found in the Latin, tho German, and the 1

English languages.

Caesar, who generally speaks of the Morini with

the Menapii, has fixed their position in general terms.!

When he first invaded Britannia he went into the j

country of the Morini, because the passage from 1

there to Britain was the shortest (/>'. G. iv. 21). In

the next expedition, B.O. 54, he sailed from Port us

It ins, having ascertained that the passage from this .

port to Britain was the most commodious. Tortus |

ltiusis in the country of the Morini [Itius PoRTrs]. ,

Ptolemy (n. II. § 8) mentions two cities of the

Morini, Gesoriacum or Bononia (^Bwhtgne1), and 1

Taruenna (7*Atro«e««r), east of it. in the interior. 1

If we add Castellum Morinorum (Gi**e/), in the ,

interior, south of l/uttfo nptet *' we see that, besides I

the diocese of Boulogne, the territory of the Morini ,

comprises the new dioceses of St. Omer and Ypem, I

which sneceeiied to that of Tournau* (D'Amille.) \

But if Casstl is not within the limits of the Morini,

their territory will not be so extensive as D'Anville

make-, it. [Mknatii.]

Caesar's wars with the Morini were more suc­

cessful than with the Menapii. A large part of the

territory of the Morini did not offer such natural

obstacles as the land of the Menapii. The marshes

of the Morini would be between CalaU and Ihtn-

kerune. The force whirl) the Morini were sup]xised j

to be able to wnd to the Relgie confederation in'

B.C. 57 was estimated at 25,000 men. Though ■

most of the Morini were subdued by Cac-ar, they |

ro.ve again in the lime of Augustus, and were put ,

down by C. Carinas (Dion Cassias, li. 21). When I

Bononia was made a Roman port, and Taruenna a

Roman town, the country of the Morini would become

Romanised, and Roman usages and (he Roman lan­

guage would prevail. There were Roman ruads

which terminated at Bononia and Castellum.

An inscription mentions the Ih-ccinviri of the

Colonia Morinorum, but it is unknown what place

it is. [G. L.]
