856 MAXDALAE. MALLUS.

xr. p. 701 ; Cart. ix. 4.) The people occupied the

space between the Acesines (Asihii) and Hyarotis

(/r.ira/i), which both enter the Indus at no great

distance. There can be little doubt that the name

represents at once the country and the town of the

Malli. ta'ing itself derived from the Sanscrit Mala-

tthiini. Pliny speaks of Malli quorwn Mons

Mallus (vi. 17. ». 21). If his locality corre-

sjionds with that of the other geographers, the name

miirht be taken from the mountain which was con­

spicuous there. It is not, however, possible from

riiny's brief notice, to determine anything of the

position of his Malli. It was in this country, and

not improbably in the actual town of the Malli (as

Arrian appears to think) that Alexander was nearly

blain in combat with the Indian tribes nf the

ranjab. [V.]

MALLUS (MaAAiii: Eth.yiaXKti-rns), an ancient

city uf Cilicia, which, according to tradition, was

founded in the Trojan times by the soothsayers

Mopfus and Ampltilochus. (Strab. xiv. p. 675, &c.;

Arrian, Anab. ii. 5.) It was situated near the mouth

of the river Pyramus, on an eminence opposite to

Mc^arsus, as we must infer from Curtius (iii. 7),

who states that Alexander entered the town after

throwing a bridge across the Pyramus. Mallus

therefore stood on the eastern bank of the river.

According to Scylax (p. 40) it was necessary to sail

np the river a short distance in order to reach Mallus;

and Mela (i. 13) also states that the town is situated

close upon the river; whence Ptolemy (v. 8. § 4)

must be mistaken in placing it more than two miles

away from the river. M;dlns was a town of consi­

derable importance, though it does not appear to

have possessed any particular attractions. Its port-

town was Magarsa [MaoarsaJ, though in later

times it seems to have had a port of its own, called

Portiis Palonun (Geogr. Nub. p.195; Sanut. Secret

a?es it continued to be called Malo; comp. Callim.

a city in the interior of the llrnttian jvniimiU.

It is noticed only by Stiabo, who places it in the

mounlains above Locri, in the neiglibourhxd of the

great forest of Si la, and by Stephanos of Byzantium,

who calls it merely a city of Italy. (Su»b. vi.

p. 261; Steph. II. t. v.) There is no reason to

reject these testimonies, though we have no other

account of the existence of such a place; and its

position cannot be determined with any greater pre­

cision. But the Mamertini who figure in history

as the occupants of Messana are wholly distinct

from the citizens of this obscure town. [Mu.

.it some period of the Roman domination a cohort uf

the Frisians was stationed at Monninium; and that

the sixth legion, or one of its divisions was there,

probably on the occasion of some journey into the

north. [C. R. S.]
