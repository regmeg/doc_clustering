and no present importance. Pliny (xxxvii. 67)

makes mention of a pern which was found

there; and in the Middle Aires its honey and poats

an- said to have been celebrated. No traveller seems

to have explored and described this island. [J.S.H.]

SAMULOCKNAK, according to the Pent. Tab.,

or more correctly according to inscriptions found on

the spot. Sl'MLOCKNSK, was apparently a Roman

colony of some importance in the Apri Decumates

of Germany, The Table erroneously places the town

in Vindelieia, whence some antiquarians have re­

garded Samulocenae and Suinlocenne as two different

j'la-es. But there can be no doubt that they are

only two forms of the same name belonging to one

town, the site of which is occupied by the modern

Sulchen, near Rnttenbnrg on the Keckur, where

many Roman remains, such as coins, inscriptions,

and arms, have been found. (Comp. J.tumann,

town of the same name. (Florez, Med. iii. p.

SAM YDACE (2a^^c£^)f a town on the coast of

Carmania, noticed by Marcian (c. 28. ed. Dtdot) and

Ptolemy (vi. 8. § 7). It appears to have been

placed oemr the mouth of the river Samydacus.

(S-e aNo Steph. B *. v.) It is possible, as suggested

by Furblger, that the river is the same as the present

Sadfi. [V.J

SANAUS (%an6i), a town of Phrygia, id the

neighbourhood of Laodiccia. (Stnib. xii. p. 576;

Uiarocl. p. 6G6.) In the acts of the Council of

Chalced"ii (pr674), it is called "Zavadv woAis, and

is probably mentioned by Ptolemy (v. 2. § 26) under

the name of Sania. [L. S.]

SANCT10, a place in the Agri Decumates, in

the .south-west of Germany, was situated on the

banks of the Rhine, but is mentioned only by Ani­

misms Mareelliuus (xii. 3). and in such a manner

that it is not easy to identify its site; it is possible,

however, that the modem Seckingen may correspond

with it. [L-S ]

SANDANES (Sae-oam, Peripl Mar. Erythr.

c. 52). There has been some question whether this

is the name of a man or of a place. As the text

stands in the Periplu?, it would seem to be that of a

ruler of the coast-district in the neighbourhood of

Bombay. On the other hand, Ptolemy speaks of the

same territory under the title of 'Aoia/fij Xatitvwv;

whence Beufey (Ersch and Griiber, EncycU art.

Ind'ten) argues, with strong probability, that the

reading in the Periplus is incorrect, and that Ptolemy

is right in making the name that of a people rather

than of a chief. [V.]
