TRAXSMONTA'NI (Tpartrnovrarol, Ptol. iii. 5.

ij the Penrinian mountains. [T. II. D. ]

IKAPEZO'POLIS (Tpas-«fdVoAir or Tpoirffow-

<hs: Elk. Trapezopolitae), a town situated, accord-

.' In Ptolemy (ii. 2. § 18), in Caria, but according

Socrates (//u(. Ecclet. vii. 36) and Hierocles (p.

55), in Phrygia. The former is the more correct

■temeot, for the town stood on the southern slope

Mount Cadmus, to the south-east of Antiochia,

.!, according to the Notitia Imperii, afterwards

1'jrnd to the province of Pucatiana. It is possible

IK.VPEZUS (T(xnr«foOj: £t/i. TpawefoiWiot:

* Tdrabotan or Trebizond), an important city on  
'coast of Pontus, on tlie slope of a hill, 60 stadia

tlie east of Hermonassa, in the territory of the

i-r>in<3 (Anon. Ptripl. P. E. p. 13), was a colony

ir.ini by the Sinopians. who fonned many esta-

•hawnta on this coast. (Xenopb. A nab. iv. 8. § 22;

ran, PeripL P. E. pp. 1, 3, 6; Scylax, p. 33.) It

rived its Dame probably from its form, being situ-

d on an elevated platform, as it were a table above

ilea; though the town of Trapezus in Arcadia

'.'tided to be the motber-city of Trapezus in Pon-

i (Pans. viiL 27. § 4). Trapezus was already a

irabing town when Xenophon arrived there on

memorable retreat; and he and his men were

it hospitably treated by the Trapezuntians. (Xen.

•i. v. J. § 10.) At that time the Colchians

* *till in poaaession of the territory, but it after-  
<i* was occupied by the Macrones. The real great-

& of Trapezus, however, seems to have commenced

ler the dominion of the Romans. Pliny (vi. 4)

a it a free city, a distinction which it had pro-

ly obtained from Pamper daring his war against

uriciates. In the reign of Hadrian, when Arrian

ted it, it was the most important city on the south

t «f the Koxine, and Trajan had before made it

capital of Pontus Cappadocicus, and provided it

- a larger and better harbour. (Arrian, Peripl.  
K. p. 17; coin p. Tar. Ann. xiii. 39, Hint. iii.47;

TV Mela, L 19; Strab. vii. pp. 3(19, 320, xi.

99, xH. p. 548; Staph. B. *. r.) Henceforth it

4 &troogly fortified commercial town; und al-

in the reign uf Oallienus it was sacked and

II by the Goths (Zbsim. i. 33; EusUth. ad

*. Per. 087 ), it continued to be in such excel-  
ciAuilion, that in the reign of Justinian it re­

nt but few repairs. (Procop. de Aed. iii. 7.)

n the Notitia Imperii (c. 27) we learn that

arxoa was the station of the first Pontian legion

its stafT. Some centuries later a branch of the

nal house of the Comneni declared themselves

undent of the Greek Empire, and made Tra-

j the seat of their principality. This small

principality maintained its independence even for

some time after the fall of Constantinople; hut

being too weak to resist the overwhelming power of

the Turks, it was obliged, in A. l). 1460, to submit

to Mohammed II., and has ever since that time been

a Turkish town. (Chalcond. ix. p. 263, foil.; Doc.

45; comp. Gibbon, Decline, c. xlviii. foil.) Tho

port of Trapezus, called Daphnus, was fonned by

the acropolis, which was built on a rock running

out into the sea. (Anon. Ptripl. P. E. p. 13.) Tho

city of Trebizond is stHI one of the most flourishing

commercial cities of Asia Minor, but it contains no

ancient remains of any interest, as most of them

belong to the period of the Lower Empire. (Toumc-

fort, Voyage au Tyrant, iii., lettre 17, p. 79, foil.;

Fontanier, Voyage* dam f Orient, p. 17—23;

Hamilton's Researches, i. p. 240.) The coins of

Trapezus all belong to the imperial period, and ex­

tend from the reign of Trajan to that of Philip.

TRA'PEZU'S (ToowefoSj, -oSmt: Etk. Tpos-f-

foOiriot), a town of Arcadia in the district Parrhasia,

a little to the left of the river Alpheius, is said to have

derived its name from its founder Trapeze us, the son

of Lycaon, or from trapeza (rpd*t(a), h a table,"

because Zeus here overturned the table on which

Lycaon offered him human food. (Pans, viii. 3. §§

2,3; Apollod. iii. 8. § 1.) It was the royal residence

of Hippothous, who transferred the seat of govern­

ment from Tegea to Trapezus. On the foundation

of Megalopolis, in n. r. 371, the inhabitants of Tra­

pezus refused to remove to the new city; and having

thus incurred the anger of the other Arcadians, they

quitted Peloponnesus, and took refuge in Trapezus

on the Pontus Euxeinus, where they were received

as a kindred people. The statues of some of their

gods were removed to Megalopolis, where they were

seen by Pausanias. Trapezus stood above the mo­

dem Mavrid. (Pans. viii. 5. § 4, 27. §§ 4—6,

viii. 29. § 1, 31. § 5; Herod, vi. 127; Steph. R. ». r.;

Pebiponnts. vol. i. p. 90.)

TRASIMENUS LACUS* (n Tpaffou/wVra or

Tpaovfiiva Af/irn, Strab.; ij Tapaiutvn hlfivn, Pol.:

iAigo di Perugia), one of the most extensive and

important of tlie lakes of Etruria, situated between

Cortona and Perusia. It is the largest of all the

lakes of Etruria, being above 10 miles in length by

8 in breadth: and diners from all the other con­

siderable lakes of that country in not being of

volcanic origin. It is merely formed in a depressed

basin, surrounded on all sides by hills of moderate

elevation, and having no natural outlet. The hills

on the X. side of the lake, which extend from

Crotona to Perusia, are considerably more elevated

than those that form the other sides of the basin,

but even these scarcely rise to the dignity of moun­

tains. The lake itself is of small depth, nowhere

exceeding 30 feet, and its banks are almost every­

where low, flat, and covered with reeds. No con-
