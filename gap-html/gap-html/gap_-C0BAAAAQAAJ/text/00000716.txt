may be represented by a "tumulus," overgrown

with treps upon the extremity of" the ridge of

Andreotiisa, where it ends in a point between Dium

and Pydna, the other two chief cities of Pieria. Be-

yond Pydna was a considerable forest, called " Pieria

Silva" (Lit, xfiv. 43), which may have furnished

the Pierian pitch, which bad such a high repu­

tation. (Herod, iv. 195; Plin. xiv. 25.) The road

from PelU to Larissa in Thessaly passed through

Pieria [Macedoxia, Vol.11, p. 237, a.], and was pro­

bably tlie route which the consul Q. Mareius Philippus

pursued in the third and fourth years of the Persic

War. (Liv. xliv. 1 —10; Leake, Northern Greece,

2. A district in Syria; a name given by the Ma-

cedoiiians to the northern roast of Syria, on the right

bank of the Orontes. The principal mountain in

this district, and which was a southern branch of

the Amanus, was also called Pieria. (Strab. xvi.

pp. 749, 751 ; Ptol. v. 15. § 8.) The chief town

was Seleuceia, which is frequently distinguished from

o'.her towns of the same name by the addition of

*v X\icpla, especially on coins. (Eckhel, vol. iii. p.

PIMOLISA (nii*wAt(Ta), a fort in the western

P1MPLEIA (ifyurAcia, Strab. ix. p. 410; Apol-

a place which appears to have been the capital of

the tribe of Adraistae, a nation mentioned by Arrian

as existing about a day's journey from the Hydraotes

sound, but has m»t, so far as we know, been iden­

tified with any existing place. [V.]

PINAKA \ra Uiyapa: Kth. Utvapevs). 1. A

large city of Lycia, at the foot of Mount Cragus,

and not far from the western hank of the river Xan-

thus, where the Lycian hero Pandarus was wor­

shipped. (Strab. xiv. 665; Steph. B. s. v.; Arrian,

Anab. i. 24; Plin. v. 2H; Ptol. v. 3. § 5; Hierocl. p.

684.) This city, though it is not often mentioned

by ancient writers, appears, from its vast and beau­

tiful ruins, to have been, as Strabo asserts, one of

the largest towns of the country. According to the

Lycian history of Meneerates, quoted by Slephanus

Byz. (s. f. 'ApnJ^njcros), the town was a coluny of

Xanthus, and originally bore the name of Xr^Tias

sus, afterwards changed into Pinara, which, ta Ik

Lycian language, signified a round hill, tbe ton

being situated on such an eminence. Its rui»*«

village of Slinara. "From amidst the aeasst

city," he says (Lycia, p. 139), "rises a snsnssf

round rocky cliff (the pinara of the Lycunt). fa-

over with tombs." Berats tha

3. A town of Cilicia (Plin. t. 22), perhaps I
