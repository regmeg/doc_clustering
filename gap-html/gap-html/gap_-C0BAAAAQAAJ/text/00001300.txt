1210 TORETAE. TOLOUS

travelled in Gallia; and it is more probable than

the tradition that the gold of Tolosa was the pro­

duce of the plunder of Delphi by Brenmia and

lus men, among whom it is said there were some

Tectosagea (Justin, xxxii. c. 3); tor it is very

doubtful if any of Urennus' soldiers got buck to

Gallia, if we admit that they came from Gallia.

Tnlo>a was in some kind of alliance with Rome

(Dion Cass, xxxiv. 97) about u. c. 106; hut the

'leutones ami Cimbri at this time h:id brokeu into

Gallia, and tear or policy induced the Tolosates to

hide witli them. Q. Serviliua Caepio (consul ii. c.

1 06) inado this a jut-text fur attacking Tolosa,

which he took and plundered of its treasures, either

in u.c. IOC or ii: the following year. This act of

sacrilege was Mip[K>ned to have been punished by

the gods, for Caepio was defeated by the Cimbri

it. c. 105, and his army was de.-troyed. (Liv. Epit.

67; Orosius, v. 15; Gell, iii. 9.) The treasure of

Tulosa never reached Rome, and perhaps Caepio

himself laid hold of some of it. However this may

he, the "Allium Tolosanum" became a proverb.

All who had touched the consecrated treasure came

to a miserable end- It seems that there was in­

quiry made into the matter at Koine, for Cicero

(f)e Nat. Ih'orutn, iii. 30) speaks of a "quaestio

uuri Tolosani."

The Tolosani or Tolosates were that division of

the Tee t usages which was nearest to the Aquitani.

A place called Fines, between Tolosa and Carcaso,

denotes the boundary of the territory of Tolosa in

that direction, as this term often indicates a terri­

torial limit in the Roman geography of Gallia

[ Fines]; and another place named Fines marks

the boundary on the north between the Tolosates

and the Cadurci.

Pliny (iii. 4) mentions Tolosa among the Op-

pida Latina of Narbonensis, or those towns which

had the Latinitas, and, as Ptolemy (ii. 10. § 9)

names it a Colonia, we must suppose that it

was made a Colonia Latina. Tolosa maintained its

importance under the Empire. Ausonius {Ordo

Nob. Urb. xii.) describes Tulosa as surrounded by a

brick wall of great circuit, and as a populous city,

which had sent out inhabitants enough to found

four other cities. The name Palladia, which Martial

(A/', ix. lol), Sidonius Apollinaris, and Ausonius

give to Tolosa appears to refer to the cultivation of

the liberal arts in this Gallic city —

"Te sibi Palladiae antetulit toga docta Tolosae."
