562 PELASGI. PELASGI.

the city being called after their name. (Strab. ix.

]>. 401.) Anil Attic historians speak of their resi­

lience there, and say that un account of their ini­

tiatory disposition they were called ittXapyoi (storks)

by the Attic people. (Strab. v. p. 221.) This is

the character generally given to the Pelasgi, and it

is curious to find Herodotus (i. 56) contrasting the

stationary habits of the Pelasgians, with the luve of |

wandering exhibited by the Hellenic Dorians. Tor

even his own account of the Pelasgi disprove,-; his

general statement; since they could not have existed ^

in so many different quarters ns he as&igns to them i

without several migrations, or—which he nowhere

asserts — an almost universal extension over Greece

and its dependencies. It is true that he says (ii. 56)

that Hellas was formerly called IVlasgia, and Thu- ,

rydides speaks (i. 3) oi the name Hellas being of

comparatively recent date, and of the Pclasgic name

being the most prevalent among the tribes of Greece;

but this does not account for the Pelasgi being found

in Asia (Horn. //. x. 429), and for their having in­

troduced Egyptian rites into Greece. (Herod, ii. 51.)

Their sojourn in Attica is related by Herodotus,

who says (vi. 137) that they had a portion of ground

under Mt Hymettus assigned them as a reward for

their services in building the wall of the Acropolis

at Athens. From this Hecataeus said they were

driven out by the Athenians from envy, because

I heir land was the best cultivated. The Athenians,

however, says Herodotus, ascribe their expulsion to

their licentious conduct. Thueydides also (ii. 17)

mentions the Pelusgic settlement beneath the Acro­

polis, and the oracle relating to it.

In the passages above quoted Herodotus speaks

of the Pelasgi as of foreign extraction. In another

passage (viii. 44) lie tells us that the Athenians

were formerly Pelasgians, and were so called, with

the surname of Cranai. They were called suc­

cessively Cecrupidae, Erechtheidae ami lones.

Strabo (xiii. p. 621) mentions a legend that the

inhabitants of Mt. Phricion near Thermopylae made

a descent upoll the place where Cyme afterwards

stood, and found it in the possession of Pelasgians,

who had suffered from the Trojan War, but were

nevertheless in jossession of Larissa, which was about

70 stades from Cyme.

We find traces of the Pelasgi in several parts of

the Peloponnese. Herodotus (i. 146) speaks of Ar­

cadian Pelasgians, and (vii. 94) tells us that the

Ionians in Achaca were formerly called Pelasgian

Aerialeaus (or Pelasgians of tlie coast). Alter

I lanaus and Xuthus came to Peloponnesus, they

were tailed Ionians, from Inn, son of Xuthus.

In the passage of Aeschylus before referred to

(Sufi/if. 250) Argos is called Pelasgian; the king of

Argus is also called ava$ n*\a(rjwi> (v. 327), and

throughout the play the words Argive and Pe!a>gian

are used indiscriminately. So, too, in tlie Prome­

theus Vine I us (v. 860), Argolis is called "the Pe­

lasgian laud." In a fragment of Sophocles (Inachim)

the king is addressed as lord of Argos and of the

Tyrrheni Pelasgi.

Strabo (vii. p. 321) speaks of Pelasgians taking

possession of part of the Peloponnese, along with

other barbarous tribes, and (v. p. 221) says that

Ephorus, on Hesiod's authority, traces the origin of

the Pelasui to Lyeaon, son of Pelasgus, and that lie

declares his own opinion to be that they were ori­

ginally Arcadians, who chose a military lite, and, by

inducing many others to join them, spread the name

f ir and wide, both among the Greeks and wherever

they happened to come. 4i The Arcadian div.w <r

According to Dionysins, Lycaon, son of FVU*r^

lived eighteen generations before the Trojan NNar (ii

i. p. 30, ed. Iteiske); and the migration of \h*

tians under Oenotrus, son of Lyeaon, in ibe vz

generation, is. in the words of Pausaniu (ra;. J

quoted by Niebuhr), *' the earliest colony, wh«'->^«

Greeks or barbarians, whereof a recollection hu b«

preserved."

Pausanias (viii. 2) gives the popular W^eni a

rent among the Arcadians, that Pel lagM u

"Hut it is likely that other men were also t*ra»*

Pelasgus; tor how could he hare reigned ntta

The use of beech-mast, which the Pythias sn

(Herod, i. 66) ascribed to the Arcadians, was tart

them by Pelasgus. His descendants became nuarn

after three generations, and gave their nan**

various districts and many towns in Greece. P

sanias also speaks of Pelasgians ctoning fnra W

LHonysiua adopts the Achaean legend, tu. I

the first abode of the Pelasgi was Achaic AT

There they were autochthons, and t.-k t.w s

from Pelasgus. Six generations aftervarbs

Peloponnesus, and migrated to Haemoma, the lea

of the colony being Aehaeus, and Phthias, aad

lasgus, sons of I.arissa and Pot-tidon. Tlw* n

gave names to three districts, Achaea, Pfid*

and Pela*giotis. Here they abode for etc gWOT*
