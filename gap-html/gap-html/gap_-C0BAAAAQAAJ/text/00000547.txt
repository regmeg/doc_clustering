WTiLIS ("OraAu ip*6piov), a port of Arabia

O'CELUM ('OitfW, Ptol. ii. 5. § 9). 1. A town

of the Vettones in Lusitania. whose inhabitants are

called by Pliny (iv. 22. s. 35) Ocelenses and Lanci-

enses. Identified by some with Caluibria, by others

with Fermotelle or Ciudad Jiodrigo. (Ukert, vol. ii.

ptl. p. 431.)

2. A town of the Callalci Lucernes in Gallaecia

(Ptol. ii. 6. § 23).

3. ('OictAoi' Si<(«>i', Ptol. ii. 3. § 6), a promon­

tory on the NE. coast of Britannia Romana, and X. of

the month of the river Abus or Bumber; prohablj

Spurn Head. [T. H. D ]

OCHE. [Euboea.]

OCHOSBANES ('OxoffedVnj) or Ochtho-

manks, a small river of Paphlagonia, falling into

the bay of Armene, a little to the noith of Sinope.

(Marcian. Heracl. p. 72; Anonym. Peripl. Pont.

Eitx. p. 7.) This is probably the same river which

Scylax (p. 33) calls Ocheraenus. [L. S.]

OCHKAS, a place in Cappadocia. (/t. Ant. p.

202.) Ptolemy (v. 6. § 12) mentions a place

Odogra or Odoga, in the district of Chammanene in

Cappadocia, between the river Halys and Mount

Argaeus, which is possibly the same as the Ochras

of the Antonine Itinerary. [L. S.]

OCHUS (o'nxos. St'rab. xi.p. 509; Ptol.vi. 11.

§§ 2, 4; Amm. Marc, xxiii. 6), a river of Central

Asia, which has been attributed to the provinces of

Hyrcania and Buctriana by Strabo and Ptolemy

respectively, as flowing through them both. It

took its rise on the N W. side of the Paropamisus

(or Hindu-Kush), and flowed in a NW. direction

through part of Bactriana towards the Caspian Sea,

and parallel with the Oxus. Pliny makes it u river

of Bactriana, and states that it and the Osus flow

from opposite sides of the same mountain (vi. 16.

§ 18). There can lie no reason for doubting that

it is represented by the present Tedjen. It is clear

that in this part of Asia all Ptolemy's places are

thrown too much to the east by an error in longi­

tude. (Wilson, ^riono, p. 145.) [V.]

OCHUS MOXS ('flxos Arrian, Indie, c. 38),a

mountain in Persis, mentioned by Arrian, supposed

by Forbiger to be that now called Xakhilu. [V.]

OCILE ('OkIA>j, Appian, B. /Hep. 75), a town

of Hispania Baetica, probably near llipa or llipla,

besieged by the Lusitanians, and relieved by Mum-

mius (Ukert, vol. ii.pt. 1. p. 372). [T. H. D.]

OCILIS ("OkiAij, Appian, B. Bisp. c. 47, sqq.),

a town of the Celtiberi, which served the Romans as

a magazine in the time of the Celtiberian war. It

was probably in the SE. part of Celtiberia, and

Beichard identifies it with Ocana, [T. H. D.]

OCINAKUS ('fliciVopoy), a river on the W. coast

of Bruttium, mentionetl only by Lycophron {Alex.

729, 1009), who tells us that i; flowed by the city

of Terina. It is generally supposed to be the same

with the Sabatus of the Itineraries (the modern

ttaruto); but its identification depends upon that

of the site of Terina, which is very uncertain.

[Terkia]. [E. H. B.]

OC1TIS ("Ownr, Ptol. ii. 3. §31), aa island on

the N. coast of Britain, and NE. from the Orhtryt,

probably Konaldia. [T. H. D.]

OCKA MONS (t) "Oa-pa), is the tiunie given by

Strabo to the lowest part of the Julian or Camic Alps,

over which was the pass leading from Aquileia to

Aemona {Ijaybach), and from thence into Pannonia
