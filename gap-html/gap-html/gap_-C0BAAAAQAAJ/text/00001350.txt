most archaic Etruscan pottery. Within was another

smaller chamber also containing cinerary urns. A

complete description of this remarkable sepulchre will

be found iu Mr. Dennis's Etruria (vol. i. ch. 2).

VELATODURUM, in Gallia, is placed by the

Antonine Itin. on the road from Vesontio (Besancpn)

to Epamanduodurum (Mandeure) xxii. from Be-

sanri>n and xii. from Mandeure. But these two

numbers exceed the distance between Besancon

and Mandeure. The termination durum seems to

show that Velatodurum was on a stream; and

D'Anville conjectures that it is near Clereval on the

Doubs, where there is a place named Pont-pierre.

corresponds to their position in Pliny's list of tribes,

VELDIDENA, one of the most important towns

of Rhaetia, on the southern bank of the river Oenus,

and on the road leading from Trident um to Augusta

Vindelicorum. (It. Ant. pp. 258, 2.09, 275, 280.)

According to coins which have been found on its

site, it was made a Roman colony with the surname

Augusta. Its site is now occupied by the convent

of Wilden in the neighbourhood of Inspruck, on

the little river Sihl. (See Roschmann, Veididena

VELE1A (Eth. Vcleias, fitis: Ru. near Monte-

polo\ a town of Liguria, situated on the frontiers of

Gallia Cisalpina. about 20 miles S. of Placentia

(Piacenza"), in the hills which form the lower slopes

of the Apennines. The Veleia tes are mentioned by

Pliny anions: tlie Ligurian tribes; and iu another pas­

sage bespeaks of " oppidum Veleiatium," which was

remarkable for the longevity of some of it* inhabitants

(vii. 49. s. 50). lie there describes it as situated

*' circa Placentiam in collibus," but its precise site  
was unknown until its remains were discovered in

1760. From the mode in which these are buried,

it seems certain that the town was overwhelmed by

a vast landslip from the neighbouring mountain.

Systematic excavations on the spot, which have been

carried on since 1760, have brought to light several

buildings of the ancient city, including the amphi­

theatre, a basilica, the forum, and several temples;

and the groat number of bronze ornaments and im­

plements of a domestic kind, as well as statues,

busts, oVc., which have been discovered on the spot,

have given celebrity to Veleia as the Pompeii of

Northern Italy. Unfortunately the great weight of

the superincumbent mass has crushed in the build­

ings, so that all the upper part of them is destroyed,

and the larger statues have suffered severely frum the

same cause. The inscriptions found there attest that

Veleia was a flourishing municipal town in the first

centuries of the Roman Empire. One of these is of

peculiar interest as containing a detailed account of

the investment of a large sum of money by the em­

peror Trajan in the purchase of la&ia firf the xaii
