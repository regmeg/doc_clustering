SABAGE'NA (2aGdyi)va, ~2,a$dyuva, or 2a§a- |

7ivu), :i town in Leaser Armenia, is mentioned oulj

by Ptolemy (v. 7. § 10) as belonging to the pre­

fecture of Laviniane. [L. S.J

SABALIXGII {2a§a.\iyyiot), a German tribe,

placed by Ptolemy (ii. 11. § 11) above the Saxonea

in the Cimbrian peninsula, the modern Schlestrv/.

In the absence of all further information about them,

it has been inferred, from the mere resemblance of

name, that they dwelt in ami about the place called

Sabyholm in the island of Lai ami. [L. S.]

SABA'RIA (Saoucifjia). an important town in

the north of Upper I'annonia, was situated in a plain

between the river Arr&bo anil the Deserts Bciorum, on

the road from Carnuntum to Poetovium. The town,

which seems to have been an ancient settlement of

the Moii, derived it.-s importance partly from tlie ferti­

lity of the plain in which it was situated, and partly

from the fact that it formed a kind of central point at

which several roads met. The emperor Claudius

raised it to the rank of a Roman colon/, whence it

received the surname of Claudia. (Plin, iii. 27;

Ptol, ii. 1"). § -4.) In this town Septimius Severus

was proclaimed Augustus (Ante!. Vict. EpiL 19),

and the emperor Valentinian resided there some

lime. (Amm. Marc. xxx. ">.) Owing to this and

other circumstances, the town rose to a high decree

of prosperity during the latter period of the lioman

Empire; and its ancient givatness is still attested by

its numerous remains of temples and aqueducts.

Many statues, inscriptions, and coins also have been

found at Stein am Anyer, which is the modern

name, or, as the Hungarians call it, Sznmbatheltj.

SABATA or SABDATA (Plin. vi. 27. s. 31), a

town of Assyria, probably the same place as the

2a§afa of Zosimus (iii. 23), which that writer de­

scribes as 30 stadia from the ancient Scleuceia. It

is also mentioned by Abulfeda (p. 253) under the

name of Sahath.

SABATPNUS LAC US (Safioro Ai/uvn, St nib.:

Logo di Bracciano\ one of the mast considerable

of ihe lakes of Etruria, which, as Strata observes, was

the most southerly of them, and consequently the

nearest to lioine and to the sea. (Strab. v. p, 221).)

It is, like most of the other lakes in the same region,

formed in the crater of an extinct volcano, and lias

consequent iy a very regular basin-like form, with a

circuit of about 2'> miles, and is surrounded on all

sides by a ridge of hills of no great elevation. It is

probable that it derived its name from u town of the

name of Sabatb, which stood on its shores, but the

rame is not found in the geographers, and the only

positive evidence of its existence is its mention iu

the Tabula as a station on the Via Claudia. {Tab.

Pent) The lake itself is called Sabata by Strabo,

and Sabate by Festus, from whom we learn that it

gave name to the Subatiue tribe of the Roman citi­

zens, one of those which was formed out of the new

citizens added to the state in u. c. 3S7. (Liv. vi.

4,5; Feat. s. v. Sabntiiiat pp. 342, 343.) Silius

It aliens speaks of the " Sabatia atagna" in the plural

(viii. 41J2), probably including under the name the

much smaller lake in the same neighbourhood called

the Lacua Alsietinua or Logo <H Afartignano. The

same tradition was reported of this lake as of the

Ciininian, and of many others, that there was a city

swallowed up by it, the remains of wbkh omU r.iil

occasionally be seen at the bottom of iu clear *ikrv

with fish of various kinds by the luxunua* Baaaaa

of late times. (Columell. viii. 16.)

The Tabula places Sabate at the dUtanee cf 3f

miles from Rome, but this number Is mocb hn*a|

the truth. The true distance is probably 27 nJa\

which w juM coincide with a sit* near lb* W.

town of Uraccumo, where there are I
