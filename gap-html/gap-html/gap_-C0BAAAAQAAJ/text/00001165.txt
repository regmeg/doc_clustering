ndrnre was Anlioch, which, as the metropolis of

'(j-ovini*, reached its highest pitch of prosperity.

>u principally this circumstance tint induced the

i»ror Hadrian to divide Syria into three parts

put. Hmdr. 14), namely: I. Syria, which by

r 'if distinction from the other two provinces was

lei Sins Cuele, Magna Syria, Syria Major, and

i»iimu simply Syria, ((Iruler. Inter. 346. 1,

VI. 5; OnUi, Inter, no. 3186, 4997; Galen, de

i. 2.) Antioch remained the capital till

Lite of Septiinius Severus, who deprived it of

i jctiilege on account of its having sided with

■-rnmus Niger, and substituted Laodiceia, which

\«/t? a i-olunv in its stead (Capitol. A/.Anton. 25;

vi ran. 9; l ip. Dig. 50. tit. 16. a. 1. § 3); and

i acli Caracalla procured that ita rights should be

■nii to Antiocli, yet Laodiceia retained ita title of

jofajua, together with a small territory comprising

r dependent cities, whilst Antioch, which had also

n raa/fe a colony by Caracalla, was likewise called

inmlonia (Corp. Inter. (Ir. no.4472; Paul-i%.

rtfupnli*, with a small territory comprising five

(Just. Mart. Dial e. Trgphone. c. 78; Ter-

Wr. Marcian.ni 13; Kckhel, vol. iii. pp 331—

) 3. Palmyra, which appears to have been the

>i«T of a procurator Caesari* ; whence we may

r last it was the centre of a fiscal circle (Xutit.

a. i. p. 83; Ulpian, Dig. 50. tit. 15. s. 1. § 5;

vy. dr A ed. ii. II; Corp. Inter. Gr. no. 4485.

S— 4499.) A fourth metropolis, Kmesa, was added

rrllrlkszubalus (Kckhel, iii. p.311; Ulpian, Dig.

ul 15. s. I. § 4). Trachonitis also formed a aejta-

torlr at this time, with the village of Phaina as

kiTpoaaffftia (Corp.Intcr. 6V.4551; Orell. Inter.

•m di«t»inn of the province of Syria was con-

id with aa alteration in the quarters of the

'prions usually stationed in Syria. In the time

The syetem of colonisation which was begun

Ucaslas. and continued into the third century

a era, was also adapted to insure the security of

pT 'inre. The first of these colonies was Be-

-*. where Augustus settled the veterans of the  
•i V. Maoedooica, and VIII. Augusta. It was a

cis juris Italic! (Kckhel, iii. p. 356; Orelli,

r. no. 514; Ulpian, Dig. 50. tit. 15. s. 1. § 1; Ku-

Carea. p. 155. Seal.) Augustus also founded

MpJrt (Ba/dbek), which received the jus Italicnm

a SrptMiuae Severus (Ulpian, L e.\ Kckhel, ill

p. 334). Under Claudius wiui founded Ptolemais

(Ace), wliich did not possess the jus Italicum (Ul­

pian, ib. § 3; Plin. v. 1 ; Kckhel, iii. p. 424).

Vespasian planted two colonies, Caesareia (Turris

Stratonis) and Kicopolis (Krnmnus) Paul. Dig.

50. tit. 15. a. 8. §7; Kckhel, iii. p. 430); which

latter, however, though originally a military colony,

appears to have possessed neither the right, nor the

name of a colonia (Kckhel, iii. p. 454; Joseph.

Bell. Jud. vii. 6; Soiwmen, Ilitt. Ecclct. v. 21.) The

chief colony founded by Hadrian was Aelia Capito-

lina (Jerusalem), whose colonists, however, were

Greeks, and therefore it did not possess the jus Itali-

cum. (Dion Cass. Ixix. 12; Kuseb. Ilitt. Ecclet. iv.6;

Manilas, xi. p. 279, ed. Bonn; Ulpian, L c. § 6.)

Hadrian also probably foumled Palmyra. Under

Septiinius Severus we have Laodiceia, Tyrus, and

Sebaste (Samaria), of which the first two possessed

the jus ltalicum. (Ulpian, ii. §3. and 7; Kckhel,

iii. p. 319, 387, soq., 440, acq.) Cararalla founded

Antioch and Kmesa (Ulpian, ib. § 4; Paul. ib. § 5;

Kckhel, iii. 302, 311), Klagabnlus Sidon (Kckhel,

iii. p. 371), and Philippus, apparently, Damascus

(ib. p. 331). To these must be added two colonies

whose foundation is unknown, Capitolias, of whose

former name we arc ignorant (Paul. Dig. 50. tit. 15.

s. 8. § 7: Kckhel, iii. p. 328, seq.), and Caesareia

ad Libanum (Area). (Kckhel, ib. p. 361.)

At the end of the fourth century of our era, Syria

was divided into atill smaller portions, namely: 1.

Syria prima, governed by a ronsularis, with the

metropolis of Antioch and the following cities:

Seleuceu, Laodiceia, Gabala, Paltos, Brruea, Chains.

2. Syria Secunda, nnder a praeaes, with Apameiamr

its chief city, and the dependent towns of Kpiphaneia,

Arethuaa, Larissa, Mariamne, Balaneia, Kaphaneae,

and Seieuceia ad Belum. Malahts (xiv. p. 265, ed.

Bonn.) ascribes ita separation from Syria Prima

to tlie reign of Theodosius II., which, however, may

be doubted. Bocking attributes the division to

Theodosius tlie Great (ad A'ot Dignit. i. p. 129).

3. Phoenicia Prima, under a consularis, with the

metropolis of Tyrus and the cities Ptolemais, Sidon,

Berytus, Byblos, Botryo, Tripolis, Arcae, Orthosias,

Aradus, Antaradus, Caesarea Paneas. 4. Phoenicia

Secunda, or Phoenicia ad Libanum, under a prse-es,

having Damascus for its capital, and embracing: the

cities of Kmesa, laodiceia ail Libanum, Heliopolis,

Abila, Palmyra. It was 6r»t separated by Theo­

dosius the Great. 5. Palnestina Prima, administered

by a consularis, and in the years 383—385 by a pro-

eonsul. Its chief city was Caesareia, and it com­

prehended the towns of Dora, Antipatris, Diospolis,

Azotus ad Mare, Azotus Mediterranea, Kleuthero-

polis, Aelia Capitolina (Jerusalem). Nespolis, Livias,

Sebaste, Antliedon, Diocletianopolis, Jup(M, Gsza,

Ilaphia, Ascalon, &c 6. Palaestina Secunda, under

a praeses, with the capital of Scythopolis, and the

towns of Gadara, Abila, Capitolias, Hippos, Tibe­

rias, Dio Caesareia, and Gabae. 7. Palaestina Tei-

tia. This was formed out of the former province of

Arabia. (Pmcop. dc Aed. v. 8.) It was governed

by a praeses, and its chief ciiy waa Petra. (Cf.

Palaestina, Vol. II. p. 533.)
