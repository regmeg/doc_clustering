Edf.tant and Celtiberi on the S, the Vascones

on the W., on the N. and NK. the small peoples at

the foot of the Pyrenees, as the Jaccetam, Cas-

tellani, Ausktasi, and Cekketam, and on the

SE. the Cosetani. Besides Ilkkda, their chief

cities were: — the colony of Celsa (Velilla, near

X'lm), Osca (Hwsca), famous in the story of Ser-

torius; and Atiianagia, which Livy (xxi. 01)

makes their capital, but which no other writer names.

On the great road from Italy into the N. of Spain,

reckoning from Tarraco, stood Ilehda, 62 M. P.;

Tolous, 32 M. P., in the oonventus of Cacsar-

augusta, and with the civitas Roinana(PIin.); Per-

Tt sA, 18 M. P. (Pertusa, on the Alcanadre); Osca,

19 M. P., whence it was 4G M. P. to Cae&araugusta

{iiiu. Ant. p. 391).

On a loop of the same road, starting from

Caesaraugusta, were: — Gallictm, 15 M. P., on

the river Gallicus (Zunra, on the Galltf/o);

Boutin ae, 18 M. P. (BouprtVo, Ptol.: Tori-

no*); Osca, 12 M.P.; Cai-s, 29 M. P.; Mem>i-

cci.eia, 19 M. P. (probably Mrmzon); Ilekda,

22 M. P. (/tin. Ant. pp. 451, 452). On the road

from Caesaraugusta, up the valley of the Gallicus,

to Benearnum (Ort/tes) in Gallia, were, Foiii'M

Gallokum, 30 M. P. (Guirea), and Ekklllnum,

22 M. P. (/kilo), whence it was 24 M. P. to the sum­

mit of the pass over the Pyrenees (Itin.Ant. p.452).

Besides these places, Ptolemy mentions Bkrgi sia

Btpyovata: Bahvjuer), on the Sieoris; Bkrgidl'.m

(BtpytHov); Erg A ("Epya); Succosa (SovKKuaa);

Gallic a Flavia (raAAuca 4>Aaou/a: Fragaf);

and Orgia (Tipnla, prob. Orgagna), a name also

found on coins (Sestini, Med. fsp. p. 99), while

the same coins bear the name of Aesones, and in­

scriptions found near the Sieoris have Aesonensis

and Jessonensis (Muratori, Nov. Thts. p. 1021,

Nos. 2, 3; Spoil, Misc. Kind. Ant. p. 188), with

which the Gessoriknses of Pliny may perhaps

have some connection. Bkksical is mentioned on

coins (Sestini, p. 107), and Octogesa (prob. La

Granja, at the confluence of the Segre and the

Ebro) by Caesar (B. C. i. Gl ; t'kert, vol. ii. pt. 1.

pp. 450—453). [P. S.]

ILE'SIUM. [Eileml'M.]

IXICI or IL'LICI (/tin. Ant. p. 401 ; 'WtKias

t) 'IAAiki'i, Ptol. ii. 6. § 62: Elche), an inland city

of the Contestani, but near the coast, on which it

had a port t^WKiKiravhs \ifiyv, Ptol. /. c. § 14),

lying just in the middle of tin* bay formed by the

Pr. Saturni and Dlanium, which was called Illici-

tanus Sinus. The city itself stood at the distance

of 52 M. P. from Carthago Nova, on the great road

to Tarraco (/tin. Ant. p. 401), and was a Cofonia

immunif. with the jus /talicum (Plin. iii. 3, s. 4;

Paulas, Dig. viii. de Cens.). Its coins are extant

of tlie period of the empire (Florez, Med. de Egp.

vol. ii. p. 458; Sestini, p. 166; Mionnet, vol. i.

p. 45, SuppL vol. i. p. 90; Eckhel, vol. i. p. 51).

Pliny adds to his mention of the place: in earn

contributtniur /cogitani. (Ukert, vol. ii. pt. 1. pp.

402. 403.) [P. S.]

ILIENSES ('IAi€7s, Paus), a people of the inte­

rior of Sardinia, who appear to have been one of the

most considerable of the mountain tribes in that

island. Mela calls them "antiquissimi in ea popu-

lorum," and Pliny also mentions them among the

"celeberrimi populorum" of Sardinia. (Mel. ii. 7.

§ 19; Plin. iii. 7. s. 13.) Pausanias, who terms

them *IAi«if, distinctly ascribes to them a Trojan

origin, and derives them from a portion of the com­

panions of Aeneas, who settled in the island, ard

remained there in quiet until they were compelled

by the Africans, who subsequently occupied the

coasts of Sardinia, to lake refuge in the more rugged

and inaccessible mountain districts of the interior.

; (Paus. x. 17. § 7.) This tale has evidently ori-

1 ginated in tiie resemblance of the name of Uienses, in

the form which the Romans pave it, to that of the

\ Tmjans; and the latter part of the story was in­

vented to account for the apparent anomaly of a

people that had come by sea dwelling in the interior

of the island. What the native name of the 11 lenses

was. we know not, and we are wholly in the dark as

to their real origin or ethnical affinities: but their

existence as one of the most considerable trills <»f

the interior at the period of the Iioman conquest, is

well ascertained ; and they are repeatedly mentioned

by Livy as contending against the. supremacy of

Home. Their first insurrection, in u.r. 181, was

repressed, rather than put down, by the praetor

M.Finarius; and in B.C. 1 78, the Uienses and Balari,

in conjunction, laid waste all the more fertile and

settled parts of the island; anil were even able to

meet the consul Ti.Sempronius Gracchus in a pitche 1

battle, in which, however, they were defeated with

heavy loss. In the course of the following year

they appear to have been reduced to complete sub­

mission; and their name is not again mentioned in

history. (Liv. xl. 19,34, xli. 6. 12, 17.)

The situation and limits of the territory occupied

by the Uienses, cannot be determined: but we hud

them associated with the Balari and Oorrd, as inha­

biting the central and mountainous districts of the

island. Their name is not found in Ptolemy, though

he gives a long list of the tribes <>f the interior.

Many writers have identified the Uienses with the

lolaenses or lolai, who are also placet! in the interior

of Sardinia; and it, is not improbable that they were

really the same people, but ancient authors certainly

make a distinction between the two. [E. 11.15.]

a city of the Turdetani, in Hisjiania Baetica, be­

longing to the conventus of Hispalis. It stood upon

the right bank of the Baetis (Gumfalquivir'), 700

stadia from its mouth, at the point up to which the

river was navigable for vessels of small burthen,

and where the tides were no longer discernible.

[Baetis.] On this and other grounds it has been

identified with the Roman ruins near Pt-najfor.

There were great silver mines in its neighbourhood.
