NIGEIR or NIGIB (Nryeip, Ptol. iv. 6. § 14;

Nryip, Agathem. ii. 10; Niger, gen. Nigria, Plin.

v. 4, 8, viii. 32), a great river of interior Libya,

flowing from W. to E. It has long been a moot

point among geographers whether the Kigeir of

the ancients should be identified with the river

now known as the Djolibd or Quorra, which, after

taking its course through the va*t plains or low­

lands of Central Africa, turns southwards towards

the Bight of Benin, where it enters the sea. For

instance, Gosselin {Geographic de» Ancient, vol. i.

pp. 125—135) came to the conclusion that the an-

cients possessed no knowledge of N\V. Africa to the

S. of the river Nun. Walekenaer(/?eV«rrcA« Geo-

graphiques sur C/nterieur de VAfriqve Sej)ien-

tritmaU, Paris. 1821) also, who has carefully dis­

cussed this point, sums up the result of his inquiries

by asserting' that none of Ptolemy's rivers can be

the same as the Djolibd or any other stream of the

Biledu-l-Siuldn, as that region was quite unknown

to antiquity, and was, in reality, discovered by the

Arabs. Following in the same track, Mr. Coolcy

(Chtuditu Ptolemy and the Nile, London, 185-1)

regards the Nigeir as a hypothetical river, repre­

senting collectively the waters of the BiUdu-l-Jerid.

On the other hand, Colonel Leake {Journ. Geog.

Soc. vol. ii. pp. 1—28), whose views are adopted in

the present article, considers that Ptolemy's informa­

tion on the J>jolib(i or Qttorra*, although extremely

imperfect, was real. There seems, indeed, to be

reason for believing that its discovery may be placed

at a much earlier period, and that its banks were

reached by the young Nasamones. [Nasamones.]

Ptolemy's statements (/. c.) are annexed, from which

it will be seen that the arguments in favour of the

identity of his Nigeir with the Quorra are very

strong. He believed that the earth was spherical;

he divided the great circle into 360°; of these de-

frees he placed the same number in the breadth of

N. Africa, that modern observations con6rm; in the

length of the same country he errod only one-tenth

in execs*. While in the interior, proceeding from a

point of the \V. coast, where his positions approxi­

mate to modern geography, he placed a great river,

flowing from \V. to E., exactly in the latitude where

the Q'tftrra flows in that direction.*

In considering the exact meaning of this passage,

it should be remembered that the word irrprri,

translated '* divergent," simply indicates the p<ui? <a*

junction of two streams, without any ref*r>cr* la

the course of their waters. At pmrnt, oar ac­

quaintance with the Quorra is too limited to Gra­

tify any of its divergents; and even were there Ja.**,

by which to institute a comparison, the imprrfertka

of Ptolemy's information will probably leave tine

particulars in obscurity. After having »tal*l '.La

the Geir and Nigeir are the two principal nm ef

If two opposite branches of a river, rUic^ m tw»

very distant mountains, flow to a common receptarV.

the whole may be described as joining the two

mountains. Of the general direction of the mi—g

of the Nigeir there can be no doubt, as the Latitudes

and longitudes of the towns on its banks (§§ 2 4—

28) prove a general bearing of E. and \V.; aad frm

its not being named among the riven of the W_

coast (§ 7), it must have been suppnwi to nW

miles to the NW. of Lake Tsckad, may be prenmwi

to represent this, the principal lake of the interior;

it was natural that Ptolemy, like many of uW

modems, should have been misinformed as to lis

position, and communication of the river with t£*

lake. It is now, indeed, known that the river d***»

not communicate with Ixike T*chnd, and that it is

not a river of the interior in Ptolemy'a ten*e; that

its sources are in a very different latitude fnen thu

which he has given; and its course varirt caav-

sidcrably from the enormous extent of direction to

the E., which results from his portion of the towns

on its banks. But recent investigations hare shews.

that the difference of longitude between hb* k on « ■/
