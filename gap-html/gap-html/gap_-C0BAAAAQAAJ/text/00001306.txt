1222 TRASIMENUS LACUS. TRASIMENUS LACls

siderable town was situated on its sliore.-i: Perusia,

from which it derives its modem name of tlie Logo

Hi Perugia, stands on a lofty hill alumt 10 miles to

the K. of it; Clnsium is .situated about 9 miles to

tli*; SW. and Cortona between 6 and 7 to the NW.

The highroad from Arretium to Perusia followed

the northern shore of tlie lake for a considerable

distance.

Tlie lake Trasimenus derives its chief celebrity

from the great victory obtained upon its shores by

Hannibal over the Roman consul, C. Flaminius,

it. c. 217, one of the greatest defeats sustained by

the Roman arms during the whole course ot their

history. The circumstances of this battle are more

clearly related and more readily understood with

reference to the actual localities than those of any

of the other great battles of Hannibal The Car­

thaginian general, after crossing the Apennines,

and effecting his toilsome inarch through the

marshes of Ktruria, had encamped in the neigh­

bourhood of Faesuiae (Pol. iii. 80, S'2). Flamimus

was at this time posted with his army at Arretium,

and Hannibal, whose object was to draw him into

a general battle, moved along the upper valley of

the Arnus, and passing within a short distance of

the consul's camp, advanced along the road towards

Home (i. e. by Perusia), laying waste the country

as he advanced. Flamimus on this hastily broke

up his camp, and followed the Carthaginian army.

Hannibal had already passed the city of Cortona on

his lett, and was advancing along the K. shore of

the lake, which lay on his right hand, when, learn­

ing that Flaininius was following him, he deter­

mined to halt and await his attack, taking advan­

tage of the strong position which offered itself to

him. (Pol. iii. 82; Liv. xxii. 4.) The hills which

extend from Cortona to the lake, called by Livy the

u inontes Cortonenses," and now known as the Monte

Guakmdro, descend completely to the bank of the

lake, or at least to the marshes that border it, at a

point near tlie NW. angle of the lake, now marked

by a village and a. round tower called Boryhttto.

This spur of the hills completely separates the basin

of the lake from the plains below Cortona, and it is

not until after surmounting it that the traveller by

the modern road comes in sight of the lake, .is well

as of the small plain or valley, shut in between its

N. shore and the GuaUmdro, which was the actual

scene of the catastrophe. "Arrived ut the highest

point of the road, tlie traveller has a partial view of

the fatal plain, which opens fully upon him as he de­

scends the GuaUindro. He soon rinds himself in a

vale, enclosed to the loft, and in front, and behind

him by the Gualandro hills, bending round in a

segment larger than a semicircle, and running down

at each cud to the lake, which obliques to the riijht

and forms the chord of this mountain arc. Tlie

position cannot bo guessed at from the plains of

Cortona, nor appears to be so completely enclosed,

unless to one who is fairly within the* hills. It

then indeed appears a place made as it were on

purpose lor a snare, 'locus intidiis natus.' (Liv.

xxii. 4.) Borghttto is then found to stand in a

narrow marshy pass close to the hill and to the lake,

whilst there is no other outlet at the opposite turn

of the mountains tban throuuh tlie little town of

Pasttynano, which is pushed iuto the water by the

foot of a high rocky acclivity. There is a woody

eminence branching down from the mountains into

the upper end of the plain nearer to the site of

rassi'jnano, and ou this stands a village called

Torre" (more properly Ttntrv). (H-iie-xat S*a
