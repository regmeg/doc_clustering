1224 TREBULA. TftEBIA.

to the \V.; where Hie town of Clastidium was be­

trayed into his hands. Meanwhile Sempronius, who

was newly arrived, after a short interval of repose,

was eager for a general engagement, and his confi­

dence was increased by a fiartial success in a combat

of cavalry, in the plain between the Trobia and the

Pad as (/6. 69.) Hannibal, who on his side \sas

equally desirous of a battle, took advantage of this

tlisjwsitiou of Sempronius, and succeeded in drawing

him out of his camp, where he could not venture to

attack him, into the plain below, which was favour­

able to the operations of the Carthaginian cavalry

and elephants. For this purpose lie sent forward a

body of Numidiau horse, who crossed the Trebia

and approached the Iioman camp, but, as soon as a

U>dy of Roman cavalry and light-armed troops were

sent out against them, retreated skirmishing until

they had recrossed the river. Seinprouius followed

with his whole army, ami crossed the Trebia, not

without difficulty, for the river was swollen with late

rains, and was only just fordable fur the infantry.

His troops suffered severely from cold and wet, and

when the two armies met in order of battle, early

began to feel themselves inferior to the enemy ; but

the victory was decided by a body of 1000 foot and

1000 horse, under the command of Mago, the brother

of Hannibal, which had been placed by that general

in ambuscade, in the hollow bed of a stream which

crossed the field of battle, and by a sudden onset on

the rear of the Iioman army, threw it into complete

confusion. A body of about 10,000 Roman infantry

hucceeded in forcing their way through the centre of

the enemy's line, but finding themselves isolated, and

their retreat to their camp quite cut off* they directed

i heir inarch at once towards Placentia, and succeeded

in reaching that city in safety. The other troops

were thrown back in confusion upon the Trebia, and

sull'ered very heavy loss in passing that river ; but

tlio.se who succeeded in crossing it, fell back upon the

body already mentioned and made good their retreat

with them to Placcutia. Thither also Scipio on the

following day repaired with that part of ihe Roman

forces which had not been engaged in the battle.

(Pol. iii. 70—74.)

Prom the view above given of the battle and the

operations that preceded it, which coincides with that

of General Vandoncourt (Campagnes dAtmibal en

Italic, vol. i. pp. 93—130), it seems certain that the

battle itself was fought on the left bank of the

Trebia, in the plain, but a short distance from the

toot of the hills ; while the Roman camp was on the

hills, and on the right bank of the Trebia. It is

certain that this view affords much the most intelli­

gible explanation of the o|»erations of the armies, aud

there is nothing in the narrative of Polybius (which

has been exclusively followed in the above account)

inconsistent with it, though it must be admitted

that some difficulties remain unexplained. Livy'a

narrative on the contrary is confused, and though

based for the most part on that of Polybius, seems

to be mixed up with that of other writers. (Liv,

xxi. 52—56.) From his account of the retreat of

the Roman army aud of Scipio to Placentia after the

battle, it seems certain that he considered the Roman

camp to be situated on the left bank of the river, so

that Scipio must necessarily cross it in order to arrive

at Placentia, and therefore he must have couceived

the battle as fought on the right bank: and this

view has been adopted by many modern writers, in­

cluding Niebuhr and Arnold; but the difficulties in

its way greatly exceed those which arise on the con­

trary hypothesis. Niebuhr indeed smnmarl*

of some of these, by maintaining, in cpp&a i u a»

distinct statements of Polybius, that Eiue^ -a.
