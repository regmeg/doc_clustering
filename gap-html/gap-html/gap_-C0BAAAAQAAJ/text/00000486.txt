Cass'r Jebh\ sonic fragments of an aqueduct with

other footsteps of an ancient city, which, with the

fountains close adjoining, and the absence of pood

water in the neighbourhood, induced liim to believe

that this was the spot near which Scipio is said to

have encamped for the benefit of the water.

These ruins at Kass'r Jehir are marked in the

NAKBO MABTIUS (h Nd/>g«v: Kth. N«p£o>-

vr}(rio$t Nap€aJviT^y, Kap^alos. Narbonensis: Nar-

bonne), a town of the Prowncia or Gailia Nar-

honensis. Ptolemy (ii. 10. § 9) enumerates it

anion" tlie inland towns of the Voleae Tectosajrcs,

under the name of Narbon Colonia. He places it

live minutes south of the latitude of Massalia {Mar­

seille), and in 43° X. Int. It is, however, bome

minutes north of 43° N. Int., and more than five

minutes south of Massalia. Hi ppa rebus placed

Narbo and Massalia nearly in the same latitude.

(Strab. ii. p. 106.) Narbo was on the Atax

(Awle), and xii. M. P. from the sea. (Plin. iii. 4.)

Pliny seems to place Narbo in the territory of the

Yoleae Teetosages, but his text is obscure. Slrabo

(iv. p. 18G) distinctly places Narbo in the territory of

the Voleae Arecomici, but lie adds that Nemausus

was their chief city. It seems, indeed, more pro­

bable that the Voleae Arccninici possessed the coast

about Narbo, for the chief city of the Teetosa£es

was Tolosa {Toulouse), in the basin ol the Garonne.

Mela (ii. 5) calls Narbo a colonia of lh<* Atacini

[Atax] and the I>ecuinani. Ausonius (De

Claris I rbibus, Narbo) does not say, as some have

supposed, that Narbo was in the territory of the

Teetosages, but that the TecU^ages formed the

western part of Narbonensis, which is true. The

conclusion from Caesar (A'. G. vii. C) is that Narbo

was not in the country of the Arecomici; but Caesar

did not trouble himself about such matters.

The position of Narbo at Narbonne is easily de­

termined by the name, by the river Atax. and by

the measures alonff the road from Italy into Spain

The road from Arelatc {Aries) through Nemansus

(Nimes), Cessero {Si. Tiberi), and Baeterrae (Be-

ziers) to Narbo, is in the Antonine 11 in. There is

also a route both in the Antonine Itin. and in the

Table from BurdigaU (Bordeaux), through Tolosa

(Tonlotut)and Carcasso (Carcassonne) to Narbo.

The name Narbon (?; Ndffe) was also one

name of the river Atax, for Polybius calls the river

Narbon. [Atax.] The form Narbona occurs in

inscriptions; and there is authority for tins form

also in the MSS. of Caesar. (B. G. iii. 20, cd. Schn.,

and viii.46.) According to Stephanus (.-?. v.) Mar-

cianus calls it Narboneaia; but this is clearly an

adjective form. Hecataeus, who is the authority

for the Ethnic name t*ctf*€aiot, must have supposed

a name Narha or Narbe. The origin of the name

Martins is not certain. The Roman colony of Naibo

was settled, ii. c. 118, in the consulship of Q. Mar-

cius Rex and M. Porcius Cato; but the founder of

the colony was L. Licinius Crass us. (Cic. Brut.

\ c. 43.) It has been conjectured that the nam*

I Martins was given to the place because of the war-

! like natives of the country against whom the

settlers had to protect themselves. But thi* b nol

probable. Others, again, have conjectured tbrt its

name is derived from the Legio Martia (Veil. Piter,

ii. 8. ed. Bnnnann); and the orthojErraphT Martaii

defended by an inscription, Narbo Mart. (Grafer,

cexxix.), and a coin of Goltzins. To this it is ob­

jected, by a writer quoted by t'kert (Galticn. p. 410),

that the Legio Martia was first fonned by Aurttstu,

and that Cicero mentions the titie Martins. (Ad

Fum. x. 33.) Forbiger copies Ukert. It spfwni

that neither of them looked at Cicero's letter, in

which he speaks, not of Narbo Martins or Marnn*,

but of the Legio Martia, which existed before tiw

time of Augustus. Cicero, however, d<ies speak d

Narbo Marcius, as it stands in Orelli's text. (/Vo

Font c. I.) The Latin MSS. write the word I-**

Marcius and Martins; and the same variation oetvat

in many oilier words of the same termination. Tb#

most probable conclusion is tliat the name Ma»tnJ

or Marcius is the name of the consul Marcius(b-C.

lis), who was fighting in this year against a I>

gurian people, named Sineni. The name may bit*

ln-ou written Narbo Marcius in Cicero's time, ual

afterwards corrupted.

Narbo was an old town, placed in a good pv?Ti-«

on the road into Spain and into the basin <»f th?

Garonne; a commercial place, we may oerui^y

assume, from the earliest time of itn ex teepee.

There was a tradition that the country of N»r-

bonne was once occupied by Bebrrces. (I>ii<iC5«.

Fray. Vales, vi. ed. Reim., and the reference to Z*

naras.) The earliest w riter who mentions KarS* a

Hecataeus. rjuoted by Stephanus; and, accordirj-y

we conclude that Narbo was well known to tb*

Greeks in the fifth century before the Clrri>tial

aera. The first Roman settlement in South Gx'.U

was Aquae Sextiae (Aix), on the cast side of :hi

Rhone. The second was Narbo Marcius, by wbki

the Romans secured the road into Spain. Cion

calls Narbo a colony of Roman citizens, a wvrj

tower of the Roman people, and a bulwark opt**—i

and placed in front of the nations in th-oe ju.-i*.

During Caesars wars in Gallia this Roman cotor^

was an important position. When P. Crasvoa ii

vaded Aquitania (b. c. 56) he pot help from ToJ-*i

Carcaso. and Narbo. at all which places then »«

a muster-roll of the fighting men. (B. G. iit. 2\\

I In the preat rising of the Galli (n. c. 52), Nari

was threatened by Lneterius, but Caesar e»"T* 1

its relief. (B. G. vii. 7.) A second colony iri

settled at Narbo, or the old one rather strvrirtl

r-ned by a sup]»lein> nlum under the dictator Cms*

(Sueton. Tiber, c. 4) by Tilierius Claudius iier

the father of the emperor Tiberius. San* rf tl

tenth legion, Caesar's favourite legion, were s^tik

here, as we may infer from the name DecumancM

; Colonia. (I'lin. iii. 4.) The name Julia Patera

which appears on inscriptions and in Martial,

derived from the dictator Caesar. The e?*»r<li*i

incut of Narbo was the cause of the d*rlin«

Massilia. Strabo, who wrote in the time rf Ai

1 gustus and Tiberius, says (iv. p. 186): " that NajH

, is the port of the Voleae Arecomici, but it it it,

more properly be called the port of tb# res*

Celtice; so much does it surpass other to-wrss

trade." (The latter part of Strabo's text is e»»rn

here.) The tin of the north-west part of the Sia^j

peninsula and of Britain passed by way of N*rt*-x.
