in a direction from S\V. to NE., from the Aral to tlic

"embouchure" of the Obi. The characteristic feature

of tiiis depression is an immense number of chains of

small lakes,communicating with each other,arranged

in a circular form, or like a necklace. These lakes

are probably the traces of Strabo's channel. The

first distinct statement of the Sea "f Aral, described

as a vast and broad lake, situated to the K. of the

river Ural or Jaik, occurs in Menander of Constan-

nople, surnamed the '* Protector," who lived in the

time of the emperor Maurice. (Mcnand. Hist. Leqat.

Barbarorum ad Romano*, pp. 300, 301, 619, 023,

&2S, ed. Bonn, 1829). But it is only with the

series of Arab geographers, at the head of whom

must be placed El-lstachry, that any positive infor­

mation upon the topography of these regions com­

mences. (Humboldt, Ante Ctntrule, vol. ii. pp.

121—364.) [E.B.J.]

§§1, 4), a chain of mountains between the rivers

Ox us and Jaxartcs, in a direction from S\V. to NE.,

and which separated Scythia from Sogdiana They

are identified with the metalliferous group of As-

ferah and Aktayh — the Botom, Botm. or Botam

("Mont Blanc') of Edrisi (ed. Jaubert, vol. ii.

pp. 198—200). The Oxi Rupks of Strabo ('Hfou

irerpa p. 517), which lie also calls the hill-tort of

Arimazes (Q. Curt. vii. 11). has been identified

by Droysen, as quoted by Thirl wall (Hint, of

Greece, vol. vi. p. 300), with the pass of Kohtgha

or Derbetid, in the Kara-tagh, between Kith and

HUsar; but as it is called the rock of the Ox us, it

must be looked for on that river, and is probably

Kurffhan- Tippa on the --1 in it. (\Y ilson, Ariana,

p. 167; Hitter, Erdhunde, vol. vii. p. 734; Hum­

boldt, Asie Centralc, vol ii. pp. IS —20.) [E.B.J.]

OXINES ('O^iVt/s), a small river on the coast of

Bithynia, according to Arrian (Ptripl. p. 14) be­

tween Heracleia and PhyIlium, and according to

Marcianus (p. 70) 90 Madia to the north-east of

Cape Posidium. (Comp. Anonym. Peripl. p. 4, where,

as in Arrian, its name is Oxinas.) It is probably

the modern Tshartik. [L. S ]

river of Central Asia, on the course of which there ap­

pears a considerable discrepancy between tbe state­

ments of ancient and modern geographers. Besides

affirming that the Oxus flowed through Hyrcania to

the Caspian or Hyrcanian sea, Strabo (ix. p. 509)

adds, upon the authority of Aristobulus, that it was

one of the largest rivers of Asia, that it was navi­

gable, and that by it much valuable merchandise was

conveyed to the Hyrcanian sea, and thence to Albania,

and by the river Cyrus to the Euxine. Pliny (vi.

19) also quotes M. Varro, who says that it was

ascertained at the time when Pompeius was carrying

on hostilities in the Ea-t against Mithridates, that a

journey of seven days from the frontier of India

brought the traveller to the Icarus, which flowed

into the Oxus; the voyage continued along that I

river into the Caspian, and across it to Vt*Cyr^
