TREVIRI. [Trevkri.]

TKIACONTASCHOKNUS (TpiaKomdrxotvos,

Ptol. iv. 7- § 32), a district so named by Ptolemy

after the analogy of the Dodecaschoenus of Egypt,

and forming the most northern part of Aethiopia on

the W. bide of the Nile, between the cataracts of

that river and the Aethiopian mountains, [T.H.D.]

TRLAD1TZA (Tp«i5*T$a; MiceLGhon.Hi.p. 214;

A post Geog. Huds. iv. p. 43), a town in Upper

Aloesia, at the confitience of the sources of the

Oescus, and the capital of the district called in late

times Dacia Interior. It was situated in a fertile

plain, and its site is identified with that of some

extensive rains S. of Sophia. [J. 11.]

TR1BALU (TptSoAAuf), a Thracian people which

appears to have been in early times a very widely

diffused and powerful race, about the Danube; but

which, being pressed upon from the N. and W. by

various nations, became gradually more and more

confined, and at length entirely disappeared from

history. Herodotus speaks of the Triballic plain,

through which flowed the river Angnis, which fell

into the lirongus, a tributary of the Ister (iv. 49).

This is probably the plain of Kusaovo in the modern

Servia.

Thucydides states (ii. 96) that on the side of the

TribalH, who were independent at the beginning of

the Peloponnesian War, the territories of Sitalcea

were bounded by the 'Ireres and Tilataei, whose W.

limit was the river Oscius (Ocscus), which must

therefore, at that time, have been the E. frontier of

the Triballi. (Cf. Plin. iii. 29, iv. 17; Strab. vii.

pp. 317, .'(IS.) Strabo(vii. p. 305) informs us that

t'ne Triballi were much exposed to the inroads of

migrating hordes driven out of their own countries

by more powerful neighbours, some expelled by the

Scythians, Bastarnae, and Sauromatae, from the N.

side of the Danube, who either settled in the islands

of that river, or crossed over into Thrace; others

from the W., set in motion by the Ulyrians.

The earliest event recorded of them is the defeat

which they gave to Sitalccs, king of the Odryaae,

who made an expedition against them, B.C. 424, in

which he lost his life (Thuciv. 101). In B.C.376

the Triballi crossed the Llaemus, and with 30.000

men advanced as far S. as the territory of Abdera,

which they ravaged without opposition. On their

return, however, loaded with booty, the people of

Abdera took advantage of their careless and dis­

orderly march, to attack them, killing upwards of

2000 men. The Triballi thereupon inarched back

to take revenge for this loss; and the Abderites,

having been joined by some of the neighbouring

Thracians, gave them battle; in the midst of which

they were deserted by their treacherous allies and,

being surrounded, were slain almost to a man. The

Triballi then prepared to lay siege to Abdera which

would now have been quite unable to resist them for

more than a very short time; but at this critical

moment, Chabrias appeared before the town with the

Athenian fleet, which had recently defeated the

Lacedaemonian fleet at Naxos. Chabrias compelled

the Tnballi to retire from Abdera, and garrisoned

the city when he departed. (Diod. xv. 36). In B.C.

339, Philip II., after raising the siege of Byzantium,

inarched to the Danube, where he defeated the Gclae,

and took much booty. On his return through the

country of the Triballi, the latter posted themselves

in a defile, and refused to allow the Macedonian army

to pass, unless Philip gave to them a part of the

plunder. A fierce battle ensued, in which Philip

was severely wounded, and wouM la*« ben yr
