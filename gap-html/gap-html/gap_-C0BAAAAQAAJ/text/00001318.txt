Tne inhabitants of Tr:<a£. called Troes (T>«fj"),

and by Roman prose-irriters Tr jard or Teacn.

were in all probability a Pelas£tan race, and seem to

have consisted of two branches. o:,e of which, the

Teucri, had emigrated from Thrace, and become

amalgamated with the Phrygian or native popolfr*

ti'jn of the country. Hence the Trojans are some­

time) called Teucri and sometimes Phryges. (Herud.

v. 122, viL 43; Strab. i. p. 62, siii. p. t>04: Vire.

A en. i. 33. 248, ii. 252, 671. &c.) The poet of

the Iliad in several points treats tiie Trojans as

inferior in civiH-ation to his own countrymen;

but it is impossible to say whether in such cases

he describes the r<*al state of things, or whe­

ther lie di>es so only from a natural partiality for

his own countrymen.

According to the common legend, the kingdom of

Troy was overturned at the capture and burning of

Ilium in rs. r. 1184; but it is attested on protty

good authority that a Tr<jan state survived the

catastrophe of its chief city, and that the kingdom

was finally destroyed by an invasion of Phrygians

who crossed over from Europe into Asia. (Xanthus.

up. Strab. xiv. p. 680. xii. p. 572.) This fact is

indirectly continued ly the testimony of Horner

himself, who makes Poseidon predict that the

posterity of Aeneas should long continue to reign

irvcr the Trojans, after the race of Priam should be

extinct. [L. S.]

TROCMADA (TpoK.uaSa), a place of uncertain

site in Galatia, which probably derived its name from

the tribe of the Trocmi, is mentioned only by late

Christian writers (Cone. Chalced. pp. 125. 309, 6<>3;

Cone. Constant, ui. p. 672; Cone. Nicaen. ii. p.

355. where its name is TpoWctSa; Hierocl. p. 698,

where it is miswritten 'PryermKaSTj.) [L. S.]

TROEZEN (Tpoiftv), & city in "liassilia of

Italy," as Stephanas (s. p.) says, if his text is right;

but perhaps he means to says '"a city of Massilia

in Italy." Eastathius (ad 11. p. 2S7) says that it

is in "Massaliotic Italy." Char-ax is Stephanas*

authority. This brief notice adds one more to the list

of Massaliotjc settlements on the coast of the Medi­

terranean ; but we know nothing of Troezen. [G. L.]
