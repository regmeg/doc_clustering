J034 STAGNA VOLCAEUiL STABULA.

(Plin. iii. 5. s. 0). Nor was it ever restore*!, so as

to resume the rank of h town; Pliny tells us that it

was in his time a more village, and the name is not

mentioned by any of the other geographers. It is,

however, incidentally noticed both by Ovid and Colu­

mella (Ovid. Met.xv. 711; Colum. R. R.x. 133), and

beems to have been, in common with the whole coast

of the Bay of Naples, a favourite locality for villas.

Among others Pomponianns, the friend of the elder

Pliny, had a villa there, where the great naturalist

(sought refuge during the celebrated eruption of Vesu­

vius in a. ]>. 79, and where he perished, suffocated by

the cinders and sulphureous fumes (Plin. Ep. vi.

16). It is certain that Stabiae was on this occasion

buried under the ashes and cinders of the volcano,

though le.-s completely than Pompeii and Hercula-

neum; but the site was again inhabited, and the

name was retained throughout the period of the

Roman Empire, though it appears to have never

again risen into a place of any consideration. It was

chiefly resorted to by invalids and others, on account

of its neighbourhood to the Mons Lactarius, for the

purpose of adopting a milk diet (Galen, de Meth.

Med. v. 12 ; Cassiod. Vttr, xi. 10; Symmaeh. Ep,

vi. 17). Its name is. found also in the Tabula, and

wiis preserved in that of Casttll 'a Mare di Stabia,

borne by the modern town. The Stabiae of the

Lower Empire seems to have been situated on the

coast, in the bight of the Bay of Naples; ami pro­

bably did not occupy the same site with the older

town, which seems to have been situated about a

mile inland at the foot of the hill of Gragnano.

The exact spot was forgotten till the remains were

accidentally brought to light about 1750; Jind since

that time excavations have been frequently made

on the site, but the results are far less interesting

than those of Pompeii and Herculaneum. They

confirm the account of Pliny, by showing that there

was no town on the spot, but merely a row of

straggling villas, mid these for the most part of an

inferior class. They seem to have suffered severely

from the earthquake of A. T>. 63, which did so much

damage to Pompeii also. (Swinburne's Travels, vol.

i. p 82.) [E. H.B.]

STA'BULA, in Gallia, is placed by theAntonine

Itin. vi. from Cambes (Gros Kembs) and xviii. from

Argentovaria (Artzenheiin). These distances bring

us to a place between Otmarsheim and Bautzheim,

where Khenanus, quoted by D'Anville, says that

traces of an old place are found.

The word Stabula meant a station or resting place

for travellers, a kind of inn, as we sec from a passage

of Ulpian {Dig. 47. tit. 5. s. 1): "qui naves, eau-

ponas, stabula exercent;" anil the men who kept

the&e places were " Stabularii." [G. L.]

STA'BULUM, AD, in Gallia, is placed by the

Antonine Itin. between Salsulae (Sokes) and Sum-

inus Pyrenaeus, or the pass of the Pyrenees at

Bellegnrde. It is supposed to be Le Boulu, which

looks like a part of the old name, on the left bank of

the Tech. The distances in the Itin. both from

Salsulae to Ad Stabulum, and from Ad Stabulum

to Surnmus Pyrenaeus. are a great deal too much.

The name, however, and the place Le Uordn on the

Tech seem to fix the position of this Stabulum.

STA'BULUM DIOME'MS (Itin. Ant. p. 331;

Ant., 12,000, according to It. Hier, from Porsul.i,

or Maximianopolis; probably the same as Pliny (iv.
