URBANA COLONIA, mentioned by Pliny ouly

(xiv. 6. s. 8), was a colony founded by Sulla in a

part of the territory of Capua, adjoining the Faler-

nus ager. From its name it would appear probable

that it was a colony of citizens from Borne itself, who

were settled by the dictator in tins fertile di.strict.

It is doubtful whether there ever was a town of the

name, as no ullusion is found to it as such, and the

district itself was reunited to that of Capua before

the time of Pliny. (Plin. 1. c; Zumpt, efe Col.

URBINUM (Ovp€?vov), was the name of two

cities or municipal towns of Umbria, situated within

a short distance of each other, which were distin­

guished by the epithets Jlortensc and Metaurense.

(Plin. iii. 14. s. 19.)

1. Uhbinum Hoktense (Urbino), Apparently

the more considerable of the two, and for that reason

frequently called simply Urbinum, was situated on a

liill between the valleys of the Metaurus and the

Pisaurus (FoyUa), rattier more than 20 miles from

the Adriatic. It is mentioned by Pliny among the

municipal towns of Umbria, and is incidentally no­

ticed by Tacitus as the place where Fabius Valens,

the general of Vitellius, was put to death, in a.d.

09, after he had fallen into the hands of the generals

of Vespasian. (Tac Hist. iii. 62.) Its municipal

rank is confirmed by numerous inscriptions, which

prove it to have been a town of some importance.

(Orell. Inscr. 3714; Gruter, Jitscr. p. 387. 8, p. 392.

1, &c) Procopius also notices it during the Gothic

Ware, and correctly describes it as situated on a

steep and lofty hill; it was at that time a strong

fortress, but was besieged and taken by lielisarius iu

a.d. 538. (Procop. B. G. ii. 19.) From this time

it seems to have continued to be a place of consider­

ation, and in the middle ages became the seat of go­

vernment of a race of independent dukes. It is still

a considerable city, and one of the capitals of the

delegation of Urbino and Pesaro, but has no remains

of antiquity, except the inscriptions almve noticed.

2. UnniNUM Metaurense (Urbania), was si­

tuated, as its name imports, in the valley of the

Metaurus. on the right bank of the river, about 6

miles below S. Angela in Vado (Tifernum Metau­

rense), and 9 from Urbino. Its municipal rank is

attested bv an inscription, in which the inhabitants

are termed" Urvinates Mataurenses, as well as by Pliny

(Gruter, Inscr. p. 463. 4; Plin. iii. 14. s. 19); but

it seems never to have been a place of much import­

ance. In the middle ages it fell into complete decay,

and was replaced by a village called Castel Durante,

which, in 1625, was enlarged and raised to the dig­

nity of a city by Urban VIII., from whom it derives

its present name of Vrbania. (Cluver. Hal. p. 620;

Rampoldi, Diz. Top. vol. iii. p. 127S.) [E. H. B.]

URBS SALVIA (Ofy§a 2o\ouia, Ptol. iii. 1. §

52: Eth. Urbis Salviensis or Urbisalviensis: Urbisag-

Ha), a town of Picenum, mentioned by Pliny among

the municipal towns of that district. (Plin. iii. 13.

s. 18.) It was situated on a hill t~en>

of the Flusor (Churnti), about 2 miles {no ;»

right bank of that river, and 7 miles E. of lirai-

num. The testimony of Pliny to its moL:uj.al r^t

is confirmed by the Liber Colon iarum. »bjci ca­

tions the " ager Urbis Salviensi*/* as weli as o

inscription {Lib. Col p. 226; On-U. /war. I87«);

and it seems to have been a flourishing town asm a

was taken and destroyed by A Uric, a ealaaury ips

which it never recovered, so that it &tiU lay bnu»

ia the time of Procopius. (Pnxvp. B. G. a. II)

Dante also notices it in the 13th century u> a am-

plete ruins (Par. svi. 73); bat the name haeatan

URBS VETUS (Orvieto), a city of Eirurii ra­

in any writer before the fall of the Eiistao Ejuwre.

but it is probable that the Urbiventum (Oi^Mrrw)

of Procopius, which figures in the Gothic Wan«i

fortress of some importance, is the same \sba »

the Urbs Vetus of P. Diac^nns. (PrucvpJJ. G. a St)

There is no doubt that the modern name ot Orritto*

derived from Urbs Vetus; but the latter is rrjistij

an appellation given in late times, and it » dea&Bj
