From a schohon (ad Theocrit vii. 45) it might be

inferred that Oromedon was another name for

Mount Prion; but according to another ancient com­

mentator Oromedon was either a surname of Mine

divinity, or the name of some wealthy and power­

ful man. [L. S-]

PRIVERNUM (Tlptovfprov: Eth. Privernas -atis:

IHpemo Vecchio), an ancient and important city of

the Volscians, afterwards included, with the rest of

the territory of that people, in Latium, in the more

extended sense of the name. It was situated in the

Volscian mountains, or Monti />/>mi; but not, likn

Setia and Norba, on the front towards the plain of

the Pontine Munshes, hut at some distance further

back, in the valley of the Amasemis. Virgil repre­

sents it as an ancient city of the Volscians, and tho

residence of Met a bus, the father of Camilla (Am. xi.

540); and there is no reason to doubt that it wiik

originally a city of that people. Its name is not

indeed mentioned during nny of the earlier wars of

the Volscians against Rome ; but on these occasions

the name of the people is generally given collectively,

and the brunt of the war naturally fell upon those

cities which more immediately adjoined the frontiers

of Latium. When the name of Privernum first a]<-

pears in history it is as a city of considerable power

and importance, holding an independent position, and

able not only to engage in, but to sustain, a war

against Rome single-handed. In n.c.358 the Pri-

vernates drew upon themselves the hostility of Rome

by plundering the lands of the Roman colonists who

had been recently settled in the Pontine Plains. Tim

next year they were attacked by the consul C. Mar-

cius, their forces defeated in the field, and they them­

selves cempelled to submit (Liv. vii. 15, 16). Rut

ttiough their submission is represented as an uncon­

ditional surrender (deditio). they certainly con­

tinued to form an independent and even powerful

state, arid only a few years afterwards again ventured

to attack the Roman colonies of Norba and Setia,

for which they were speedily punished by the consul

C. Plautius: their city is said to have been tak*>n,

and two-thirds of their territory forfeited. (Id. vii.
