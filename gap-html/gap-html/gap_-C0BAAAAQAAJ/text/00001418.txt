334 ZACYXTHTS. XOIS.

XOIS (Hrfir, Strab. ami. p. 802; Ptol.iv. 5. § 50;

E'Jtjs. Steph. Ii. s. v.). a town of great antiquity and

considerable size, was .situated nearly in the centre of

the Delta, upon an island formed by tlie Sebennytic

and Phatnitic branches of the Nile. It belonged to

the Sebennytic Nome. The 14th dynasty, accord­

ing to Manetho, consisted of 7G Xoite kings. This

dynasty immediately preceded that of the shepherd

kings of Aogypt. It seems probable, therefore, that

Xois, from its strong position among the marshes

funned by the intersecting branches of the river,

held out during the occupation of the Delta by the

llyksos, or at least compromised with the invaders

by paying them tribute. By some geographers it

is supposed to be the Papremis of Herodotus (ii. 59,

iii. 12). Champollion (VEgypte sous les Pharaons,

vol. ii. p. 214) believes its site to have been at

Sakkra. which is the Arabian synonyme of the

Coptic Xeos and of the old Aegyptian Slchoo (Niebuhr.

Travels, vol. i. p. 75.) The road from Tamiathis to

Memphis passed through Xois. [W.B.D.]

XYLENO'POLIS, a town said by Pliny, on the

authority it would seem of Oncsicritus or Nearchns,

to have been founded by Alexander the Great (vi.

23. s. 26). It must have been in the southern part

of Siude; but its posit ion cannot be recognised, as

Pliny himself states that the authors to whom he

refers did not say on what river it was situated. [V.]

XYLICOENSES (o'is.uMkk^s AlBioirts, Ptol. iv.

6. § 23), an Aetliiopian people in Libya Interior, be­

tween the mountains Araneas and Arualtes. [T.H.D.]

XYMNE COME, a village in Pisidia, between

CorbasA and Termessus, is mentioned only by Livy

(xxxviii. 15). A place culled Xyline, in the country

of the Cissians in Pontus, is noticed bv Ptolemy

(v. 6. § 6). '[I. S.]

XYLO'POLIS (EiAdVoA(s). a town of Mygdonia

in Macedonia (Ptol. iii. 13. § 36), whose inhabitants,

the Xvlopolitae, are mentioned by Pliny also (iv. 10.

s.17).

XY'XIA or XY'NIAE (Ewi'a: Eth. Ewtfi5s), a

town near the .southern confines of Thessaly, and the

district of the Aenianes (Liv. xxxiii. 3), which gave

its name to the lake Xynias (HuWas), which Ste-

phamis confounds with the Boebeis (Apollon. Rhod.

1. 67; Catull. Ixiii. 287.; Steph. B. s. v. Bwia).

Xynia, having been deserted by its inhabitants, was

plundered by the Aetolians in it. c. 198 (Liv. xxxii.

13). In the following year Flamininus arrived at

this place in three days'march from Hcraclea (Liv.

xxxiii. 3; comp. Liv. xxxix. 26). The lake of Xy­

nias is now called TanHi, and is described as 6 miles

in circumference. The site of the ancient city is

marked by .some remains of ruined edifices upon a

promontory or peninsula in the lake. (Leake, North-

em Greece, vol. i. p. 46U, vol. iv. p. 517.)

modern site, [V.]

perhaps the modern Lvjor. [J. R.]

ZA'BATUS (ZaSaros), a river of Assyria, first

noticed by Xenophon (Anab. ii. 5. § 1, iii. 3. § 6),

and the same as the Lycus of Polybius (v. 51),

Arrian {Anab. iii. 15), and Straho (u_ p. 79. it

p. 737). It is called Zabas by Amauar.^s (r-JL Ui
