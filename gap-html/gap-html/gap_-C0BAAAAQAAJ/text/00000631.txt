the Tauric Chersonesus on the western side of the

Cimmerian Bosporus, and not far from the entrance

to the Lucus Maeotis. (Strab. vii. p. 309; Appian,

Mithr. 107.) Scylax says (p. 30, Huds.) that

Panticnpaeum was 30 stadia from the Maeotis.

which is too short a distance; but Arrian (Peripl.

§ 29, p. 20, Hods.) more correctly makes the dis­

tance 60 stadia from Pantica[iaeum to the mouth of

the Tanais, the Maeotis being regarded by this

writer as a continuation of the Tanais, and the Bos­

porus as the mouth of the latter. According to

Steph. B. (ff. r.) Panticapaeum derived its name

from & river Panticapes; but this is a mistake of

the learned Byzantine, who appears to have recol­

lected the river of this name mentioned by Herodo­

tus, and therefore connected it with the city Panti­

capaeum, which, however, does not stand upon any

river. Ammianus also erroneously places it on the

Hypanis (xxii. 8. § 26). According to a tradition

preserved by Stephanus («. t>.) it was founded by a

son of Aeetes, who received the district as a pre­

sent from the Scythian king Agaetes; but we

know from history that it was a Milesian colony,

and apparently one of the earliest on this coast.

(Strab. vii. p. 309; Plin. iv. 12. s. 26.) Ammianus

{I. c.) calls it the mother of all the Milesian towns

on the Bosporus; but the date of its foundation can­

not be determined. Bockh (Inscr. vol. ii. p. 91)

places it about 01. 59. 4 (b. c. 541), and it must

certainly have been earlier than 01. 75.1 (b. C.

480), which is the date asMgned to it by Niebulir.

(KUine Schrift. vol. i. p. 373.) The Greeks con­

nected the name Panticapaeum with the god Pan,

whose figure, or that of a Satyr, frequently appears

on the coins of the city; but this name, as well as

that of the river Panticapes, probably belonged to

the Scythian language, and was, as in simitar casta,

adopted by the Greeks with an Hellenic termination.

Panticapaeum was the capital of the kings of

Bosporus (Strab. xi. p. 495; Diod. xx. 24), of whom

a brief account is given elsewhere. [Vol. I. p. 422. j

Accordingly Panticapaeum was frequently called Bos­

porus, though the latter name was also given to the

whole kingdom. Hence, when Demosthenes says that

Theudosia was reckoned by many as good a harbour

as Bosporus, he evidently means by the latter the

capital and not the kingdom {inLe.pt. p. 467); anil

accordingly Pliny expressly says (iv. 12. s. 24) that

Panticapieum was called Bosporus by some. Eu-

tropius (vii. 9) erroneously makes Panticapaeum

and Bosporus two different cities. Under the By­

zantines Bosporus became the ordinary name of the

city (Procop. de Aedif. iii. 7, B. Pera. i. 12. B.

Gvth. iv. 5); and among the inhabitants of the
