KEHOBOTH (translated eypux^P1'* »' L\X.).

one of the wells dug by Isaac in the country ot' j

Gerar,— after Esek (contention) and SUnah (ha­

tred).— tor which the herdsmen did not strive: so

he called it Kehoboth: ''And lie said, For now the

Lord hath made room for us, and we shall be fruit­

ful in the land." {Gen. xxvi. 1 ^. 20—22.) There

was a town in the vieinity <4* [he well, tin* traces of j

winch were recovered, with the well itself, by Mr. I

Rowlands, in 1843. "About a quarter of an hour

beyond Scbata, we came to the remains of what

must liave been a very well-built city, called now

ftokvbeh. This is undoubtedly the ancient Keho­

both, where Abraham, and afterwards Isaac, digged

a well. Tins lies, as Kehoboth did. in the land of

Gerar. Outside the walls of the city is an ancient

well of living and good water called Bir-Hohibth.

This most probably is the site, if not the well itself,

digged by Isaac." (Williams's Uohj City, vol. i.

KKIL APOIXINA'RES (/?/«), in Gallia N'ar-

boneiisis. Among the Oppida Latina of Gallia Kar-

boneusis, or those which had the Latinitas, Pliny

(ni. c. 4) enumerates '* Alebece Reiorum Apoili-

narium." The olil reading, " Alebeeeriorum Apol-

lmariuin," is a blunder made by joining two words

together, which has been corrected from the better

MSS.. from the inscription col. keiok. ai*om.inak.,

and froin the Table, whnh lias Keis Ajx>llinaiis.

The place may have taken its name from a temple

of Apollo built after the town became Roman. The

name Alebece may be corrupt, or it may be a varia­

tion of the form Albici or Albioeci. [Albici.] As

Pliny calln the place an Oppidum Latinum, we

might suppose thai it was made a Coloiua after his

time, but the name C«d. Jul. Aug. Apollinar. Reior.,

which ap[Mvir> in an inscription, shows it to have

been a colony of Augustus.

liicz is in the arrondissement of DUjm in the de-

partment uf Alpes. There are fair columns

standing near the town, which may be the remains

ot'a temple. The bases and the capitals are marble:

the shafts are a very hard granite, and about 18 feet

high. There is iilso a small circular building con-

m.siing of eight eoluinns resting on a basement, but

it lias been sailed l-y modern hands. There now

stands in it a rectangular altar of one block of white

marble, which bears an inscription to the Mother of

the Gihls and the Great Goddess. At liiez there

have been di-covered an enorinuus quantity of frag­

ments of granite columns; and it is said that there

have been a circus and a theatre in the town.
