116 LAGUSA. LAKMA.

LAE'LIA (AaiAia, Ptol. ii. 4. § 12: Aracwa

or El /Jcff -ntl). an inland city of tin- T unlet aui, in

the W. of Hispania Baetica, not far from Italica, is

one of the Spanish cities of which wo have several

coins, belonging to the period of its independence, as

well as to the early Roman empire. Their types are,

an armed hor.>eman, at full speed, with ears of corn,

houghs, ami palm-trees. (Horez, E&p. ^- vol. xii.

pp. 256—258: Mtd. vol. ii. p. 4Mi. vol. iii. p. 92;

Mionuet, vol. i. p. 19, Suppl. vol. i. p. iio ; Scstini,

Med, pp. 20. G5 ; Num. Goth.; Eckhtl, vol. i. p. 25;

VUv, vol. ii. pt. 1. p. 373.) [P. S]

LAEPA {fspe, near Ayamtmte), a city of the

Turdrtani, on the coast of liaetiea, a little E. of the

mouth of the Anas (Guatluhpiivir: Mela, iii. 1;

com p. Plin. iii. 1. s. 3, where, however, the rending

is doubtful; fl<ll. Alex. 57, where Lnepam should

probably lie substituted for the MS. readings of

Ltptim or Leptmri; Florez, Esp. S. vol. x. p. 45,

vol. xti. pp. 56, 57; Ukert, vol. ii. pt. 1. p. 339.

This place must not be confounded with Ptolemy's

Laki'A, which is only a various reading for

Ilipa). [P. S.]

LAERON FL. [Gallakcia.]

LAESTKY'GONES (AanrrpvySv*s), a fabulous

people of giants, who are mentioned by Ilumer in

the Odyssey (x. 80—132), and described as governed

by a king named Lamus. They were a pastoral

people, but had a city (&rn/) which Homer calls

AaiffTpuyovtri, with a port, and a fountain named Ar-

tacia. It may well be doubted whether Homer meant

to assign any definite locality to this people, any

more than to the Cyclopes; but later Greek writers

did not foil to fix the place of their abode, though

opinions were much divided on the subject. The

general tradition, as we learn from Thucydidcs (vi.

2), placed them in Sicily, though that historian

wisely declares his total ignorance of everything

concerning them. Other writers were lewj cautious;

some fixed their abodes in the W. or N\V. part of the

island, in the country subsequently occupied by the

Elymi (Lycophr. Alex. 956); but the more pre­

valent opinion, at least in later times, seems to have

been that they dwelt in the neighbourhood of Lcon-

tini, whence the name of Laestrygosii Campi was

given to the fertile plain in the neighbourhood of

that city. (Strab. i. p. 20; Plin. iii. 8. s. 14; Tzetz.

adLycophr. 662,956; Sil. Ital. xiv. 126.) A wholly

different tradition, with the origin of which we are

unacquainted, but which is very generally adopted

by Roman writers, represented Fomiiae on the coast

of Italy as the abode of the Laestrygones, ami the

city of their king Lamus. The noble family of the

Lamiae, in the days of Augustus, even pretended to

derive their descent from the mythical king of the

Laestrygones. (Cic. ad Att. ii. 13; Hor. Carm. iii.

17: Plin. iii. 5. s. 9; Sil. Ital. vii. 410.) [E.H.B.]

LAEV1 or LAI (A<£oi), a tribe of Cisalpine Gauls,

who dwelt near the sources of the river Padus. This

is the statement of Polybius (ii. 17), who associates

them with the Libicii (A*£*Kio<). and says that the

two tribes occupied the part of the plains of Cis­

alpine Gaul nearest to the sources of the Padus, and

next to them came the Insubres. lie distinctly

reckons them among the Gaulish tribes who had

crossed the Alps and settled in the plains of Northern

Italy: on the other hand, both I.ivy and Pliny call

them Ligurians. (Liv. v. 35; Plin. iii. 17. s. 21.)

The reading in the passage of I.ivy is, indeed, very

uncertain; but he would appear t<» agree with Pliny

in placing them in the neighbourhood of Ticiimm.

Pliny even ascribes the foundation of that city to

the Laevi, in conjunction with the llarici, a name

otherwise wholly unknown, but apparently aImj a

Ligurian tribe. '1 here can be no doubt that in

this part of Italy tribes of Gaulish and Lipurian

origin were very much intermixed, and probably the

latter were iu many cases confounded with tti«

Gauls. [Lioi'RtA.]

LAGANIA (Aaryav'ta), a village of the Tecto-

sagae in Galatia, 24 miles to the east of JaliopoUs.

It is not mentioned by any of the classical wntfr*.

but it must afterwards have increased in inip''rian<T.

for during the Christian period, it was the see <*' t

bi:diop, and took the name of Ana--tasiopolis (tWi7.

Chnic. p. 662, and p. 95, where the name is mis­

spelt Aucrcuviot; Jtin. Ant. p. 142, where the aaom

is Latjmuos; It, I/fcros. p. 574, where we read

Agannia). There is little doubt that the hakaaa

in Ptolemy (v. 1. § 14) and the Kheganagalia erf

Hierocles (p. 697) are the same as Lagania (comj^

Thcod. Sye. c. 2). ICiepert, in his map of Asia

Minor, identifies it with Big Basar. [L. Sv]

LAGA'KIA (Aayapta; V.th. Aayaptraids, Laga-

rinus), a small t)wn of Lucania, situated between

Thurii and the river Sybaris; which, according to

the commonly received legend, was founded by i

colony of Phoeians under the command of Epeia*,

the architect of the wooden hor.se, (Strab. vi. p. 263;

Lycophr. Alex. 930; Tzetz. ad loc.) Strabo. the

only geographical writer who mentions it. calls it

only a fortress (<t>povpioi>). and it was probably nerei

a place of any importance; though deriving some

celebrity in after times from the excellence of ha

wine, which was esteemed one of the bo-t in Italy.

(Strab. I. c; Plin. xiv. G. s. 8.) The statement cl

Strabo, above quoted, is the only cine to its potdt:"n,

which cannot therefore be determined with any

certainty. Cluverius placed it at A'ocara, aboal

10 miles from the sea, and this conjecture (for it a

nothing more) has been adopted by RomaneHi. Tb<

wines of this neighbourhood are said stiil to prefer ti

their ancient reputation. (Cluver. ItaL p. 1272

Komanelli, vol. i. p. 24S.) [E. H. B.]

LAGECUM. [Legeolium.]

LAGINA (to Adyaa). a place in the terriltr

of Stratoniccia, in Caria, contained a most spJeruiu

temple of Hecate, at which every year great festival

were celebrated. (Strab. xiv. p. 660.) Tacitc

{Ann, iii. (12), when speaking of the worship <

Trivia among the Stratoniceians, evidently v.w^'

Hecate. The name of Lagina is still preserve*! i

the village of Laktna, not far from the sources i

the Tshina. Laginia, mentioned by Steph. B. as

ttoK'ixvlov Kaot'as, seems to be the same as tl

Lagina of Strabo. [L. S.}

LAGN1 (Acryfi), a town of the Are-vacae.

Hispania Tarraconensis. mentioned only by Di xl t

Siculus (Excerpt, vol. ii. p. 596). [P. S-]

LAGOS, a town in Phrygia, on the norih-ea>*.

Mandropolis. (Liv. xxxviii. 15.) The town is n>«

tioned only by Livy in his account of the pr>?re«»a

the Roman consul On. Manlius in Asia Minor, *\

Lagos was found deserted by its inhabitant*, I

well provided with stores of every description, *bfl

we may infer that it was a town of some con

quence. [L. 6-]

LAGU'SA (Aayovffa, Aayoutrtra), an island to

Aegaean sea, the name of which occurs in Sir

between those, of Sicinus and Pholegandra. He

it is probably the same as Knri:'iotisAQt & ro.

islet between the two latter inlands. Uat Kiev
