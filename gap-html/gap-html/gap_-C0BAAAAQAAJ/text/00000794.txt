710 RHIPE. RHIZOX.

River of Egypt is Wady-el-Arish. The village is

hituated on an eminence about half a mile from the

sua, ami is for the most part enclosed within a wall

of considerable thickness. There arc some Roman

ruins, such as marble columns, &c, and a very fine

well of good water. (Irby and Mangles, Travels,

p. 174, October 7.) [G. W.]

RHIPE. [Knispr.]

RHIPAEI MONTES(t4 'Pnrora o>tj), a name

applied by Grecian fancy to a mountain chain whose

peaks ruse to the N. of the known world. It is

probably connected with the word ^iiraf, or the chill

rushing blasts of Bopc'ai, the mountain wind or

tramontane" of the Greek Archipelago, which

was conceived to issue from the caverns of this

mountain range. Hence arose the notion of the

happiness of those living beyond these mountains —

the only place exempt from the northern blasts. In

fact they appear in this form of 'Pi-irai, in Alcman

(Fragm. p. 80, ed. Welckcr), a lyric poet of the

7th century n. c, who is the first to mention them.

The contemporary writers Damastes of Sigeum (ap.

Steph. B. 3. v. "Tirep€6, (oi) and Hellanicus of Lesbos

(ap. Ckm. Alex. Strom, i. p. 305) agree in their

statements in placing beyond the tabled tribes of the

N. the Rhipaean mountains from which the north

wind blows, and on the other side of these, on the

sea-coast, the Hyperboreans. The legends connected

with this imagined range of mountains lingered for

a long period in Grecian literature, as may be seen

from the statements of Hecataeus of Abdera (ap.

Aelian. II. A. xi. 1) and Aristotle (Met i. 13;

coin p. Soph. Oed. Col. 1*248; Schol. ad he.; Strab.

vii. pp. 295,299.) Herodotus knows nothing of the

Rhipaean mountains or the Alps, though the positive

geography of the X. begins with him. It would be

an idle inquiry to identify the Rhipaean range with

any actual chain. As the knowledge of the Greeks

advanced, the geographical "my thus" was moved

further and further to the N. till it reached the

48th degree of latitude N. of the Maeotic lake and

the Caspian, between the Don, the Volga, and the

Jaik, where Europe and Asia melt as it were into

eaeli other in wide | lains or steppes. These " moun­

tains of the winds" followed in the train of the

meteorological " my thus" of the Hyperboreans which

wandered with Heracles far to the W. Geogra­

phical discovery embodied the picture which the

imagination had formed. Poseidonius (ap. Atken.

vi. p. 223, d.) seems to have considered this range

to be the Alps. The Roman poets, borrowing from

the Greeks, made the Rhipaean chain the extreme

limit to the N. (Virg. Georg. i. 240; Pmpert i. 6.3;

Sil. It. xi. 459); and Lucan (iii. 273) plates the

sources of the Tanaia in this chain. (Comp. Mela,

i. 19. § 18; Plin. iv. 24; Amm. Marc. xxii. 8. §38;

Procop. IS. G. iv. G; Sid. A poll. ii. 343; Jornand.

Get. 10; Oros. i. 2.) In the earlier writers the

form is Ripaei, but with Pliny and those who

followed him the p becomes aspirated. In the

geography of Ptolemy (hi. 5. §§ 15, 19) and Mer­

cian (Ptripl. § 39, ed. Didot) the Rhipaean chain

appears to be that gently rising ground which

divides the rivers which flow into the Baltic from

those which run to the Euxine. [E. B. J.]

RHISPIA ('PiffTria), a place in Upper Pannonia,

of uncertain site (Ptol. ii. 15. § 4; Orelli, fn-
