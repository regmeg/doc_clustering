paean sea, and one of the smaller of the Cyelades,

lying between Melos and Sicinos. It was said to

have derived its name from a son of Minos. (Steph.

H. s, r.) It was called tlie iron Pholegaodros by

A rat us, on account of its ruggedness, but it is more

fertile and better cultivated than this epithet would

lead one to suppose. Tlie modern town stands upon

th'* site of the ancient city, of which there are only

a few remains, upon the northern side of the island.

PUOTICE (i+u'TucTf), a city in Epeirus, mentioned

only by later writers, was restored by Justinian.

Procopius says that it originally stood in a marshy

situation, and that Justinian built, a citadel npon a

neighbouring height. It is identified by Veld, in the

ancient Molos&U, which now given title to a bishop,

but there are no Hellenic remains at this place.

PHRA (+pt£, Isidor. Mam. Parth. c. 16), a town

in Ariana. mentioned by Uidorus in his brief sum­

mary of the principal stations between Mesopotamia

and Arachosia. There can be little doubt that this

place corresponds with the Ferrah or Furrah of

modern times (Wilson,Ariana, p. 153), on the river

called the Ferrah-rud. Kilter (viii. p. 120) has

supposed that this is the same place which Ptolemy

mentions by the name of Pliurazana, in Drnngiana

(vi. 19. § 5); and Droysen (ii. p. 610) imagines

that it is the same a> the Phrada (if Stephanua B.,

which was also a city of Dranghuuu Both con­

jectures are probable. [V.]

in ancient Media, which seems to have served as a

winter residence for the Parthian king*, and at the

same time as a stronghold in the case of need. Its

position is doubtful. Forbiger imagines that it is

the same as tlie citadel described by Strabo, under

the name of Vera (xi. p. 523); and there seems BOOM

ground for supposing that it is reiHj tbe am
