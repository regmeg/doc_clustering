MATILO. MAURITANIA.

A raxes, which is giving them too extended a range

from X. to S. (i. 189, 202). [V.]

MATILO, in Gallia Belgtca, is placed by the

Table on a nmte which ran from Lngdunum {Leiden)

along the Rhine. The first place from Lugdanum is

Praetorium Agrippmae (btownburg), and the next is

Matilo, supposed to be Ilkynenburg. [G. L.]

MATILICA Matilicaa, -at is: Matilica), a

municipal town of L'mbria, situated in the Apen­

nines, near the sources of the Aesis, and close to the

entities of Picennm. It is mentioned both by Pliny

and the Liber Coloniarum, of which the latter in­

cludes it among the *' Cmtates Piceni." Towarda

the close of the Roman Empire it apj>ears as an cpis-

copal see, included in the province then termed

"Picennm Suburbicarinm.n (PHn. iii. 14. s. 19;

Lib. Colon, p. 257; Bingham's Keel. Antiq. book ix.

ch. 5. § 4.) Matilica is still a considerable town, and

retains the ancient site as well as name. [E. 11. 11.]

MATINUS MONSu [Gargasus.]

MATISCO, a place in Gallia Celtic*, in the ter­

ritory of the Aedui in Caesar's time, and on the

Sadne. (H. 0. vii. HO.) After the capture of

Alesia, n. C. 52, Caesar placed P. Sulpicius at

Matisco with a legion during tire winter, to look

after the supply of com for the army. (B. 0. VUL 4.)

The position of Matisco is fixed by the name, its site

on the river, and the [tins. The name, it is said,

was written Mastico bj a transposition of the letters;

and from this form came the name Mascon, and by

a common change, MAcan. The form Maatisco occurs

in the Table. (D'Anville, Notice, c*c.) [G. L.]

MATITAE. 'Nigeir.]

MATIUM, a maritime city of Crete, next to the

E. of Apoltonia in Pliny's list (iv. 12), and opposite

to the island of Dia,—" Contra Matium Dia" (/. a),

The modern Megalo- Ka.<tr<m occupies the ancient

site. (Pashlev, Trnv. vol. i. pp. 172, 201; Hock,

A'rWa, vol. i. pp. 12, 403.) [E. B. J.]

MATRICEM, Al>, a conquerable town in Illyri-

enm, which the Petitinger Table plat es between Ris-

tue Vetus and Bistue Nova, 20 M. P. from the

former, and 25 M. P. from the latter. It must be

identical with Mostar, the chief town of I/trzegOttna,

standing on both banks of the Narcnta. connected

by the beautiful bridge for which it has always

been celebrated. The towers of this bridge are, ac­

cording to tradition, nn Roman substructions, and

its construction is attributed to Trajan, or, accord­

ing to come, Hadrian. The word "most" " star"

signifies 11 old bridge.*1 (Wilkinson, I>Mi»atia, vol.

ii. pp. 57—63; Is'eigebaur, Vie Swi-Slaven, p.

127.) [E. B. .1.]

MATRPNUS (MaT^ii'cij), a river of Picenum,

flowing into the Ad;iatic, now called I.a Piomba,

Strabo describes it as flowing from the city of Adria,

but it is in reality intermediate between Adria

(Atrt) and Angulns (Cifita 6'. Atigdo). According

to the Mine writer it had a town of the same name

at its nvrnth, which served as the port of Adria.

(Strah. v. p. 241.) Ptolemy also mentions the

mouth of the river Matrinus next to that of the

Atcrnus. from which it is distant about 0 miles

(Ptol. iii. 1. § 20), but he is certainly in error in

assigning it to the Marrueini. [E. II. li-]

MATRONA or MATRONAE MONS is the name

given by later Latin writers to the pass of the Mont

fiVfircrc, from Segusio {Stum) to Brigantia (/>/*»-

anrvn), which was more commonly known by the

general appellation of the Ali**s Cottiae. The pass

is described in some detail by Ammiauus3 from whom

it appears that the name was applied only to I

higher part, or actual pass of the mountain: i

this is confirmed by t lie Jerusalem Itinenry, wh

gives the name of A1 pes Cottiae to the whole p

from Ebrodunam (A'm6n/n) to Segusio, and c

fines that of Matrona to the actual mountain

tween Brigantia (Bruiricon) and Gesdao (Ctsam

(Itin. IHrr. p. 556: Amm. xv. 10. § 6.) [E. H. ]

MATRONA. [Seqcana.]

MATT I AC I, a German tribe, perhaps a bru

of the Chatti, their eastern neighbours, probi

occupied the modern duchy of Nassau, between

l ivers J.ahn, Main, and Rhine. They are not m

tioncd in history until the time of the emperor CI

riius;theythen became entirely snbject to the Kom

(Tac. derm. 29), who built fortresses and wor

the silver mines in their country. (Tac. A

xi. 20.) In A. r>. 70, during the insurTectii*

Civilis, the Mattiaci, in conjunction with theCh

and other tribes, besieged the Roman garrison

Moguntiacuro (Mayence: Tac Hist. IT. 37);

after this event they disappear from history, tl

country being occupied by the Alemanni. In

Not ilia Imperii, however, Mattiaci are hi ill n

tioned among the Palatine legions, and in connec

with the cohorts of the Batavi. The country of

Mattiaci was and still is very remarkable fir

many hot-springs, and the " Aquae Mattiacae,"

modern Wiesbaden, are repeatedly referred to

the Romans. (Plin. xxxi. 17; Amm. Marc. I

4; Aqvae Mattiacak.) Prom Martial (xir.

Mattiacae Pilae) we leani that the Romans impa

from the country of the Mattiaci balls or cake

soap to dye grey hairs. The name Mattiaci is

bably derived from matte, a meadow, and ach^

nifying water or hath. (Comp. OrelH, Insa

Nos. 4977 and 49S3; Zeuss, Die Iteutscke*

98, foil.) [L.&

MATT1ACUM (MaTTmvoV), a town in then

of the country of the Mattiaci. (Ptol. ii. 11. §

Some writers believe this town to be the sam

the Mattium mentioned by Tacitus (Ann. i. 56

tlie capital of the Chatti, which was set on fir

A. D. 15, during the war of Germanicus. fit

careful examination of the passage in Tacitns si

that this cannot be; and that Matti&cum is

bably the modern town of Marburg on the I

(Logana), whereas Mattium is the modern Mi

on the right bank of the AVer (Adrana). (O
