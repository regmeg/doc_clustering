civilisation. Their language was, according to

Ktrabo (xii. p. 572), a mixture of Lydian and

Phrygian, that is, perhaps, a dialect akin to both of

tliein. Their comparatively low state «tf civilisation

bijftnfl also to bo indicated by the armour attributed

to them by Herodotus (\ii. 74), which consisted of

a common helmet, a small shield, and a javelin, the

point of which was hardened by fire. At a later

time, tho influence of the Greeks by whom they

were surrounded seems t«i have done away with

everything that was peculiar to them as a nation,

and to have drawn them into the sphere of Greek

civilisation. (Comp. Forbiger, Handbuch der att&i

(lenr/raphie, vol. ii. p. 110, Sec.; Cramer, Ana

Minor, i. p. 30, &c.; Xiebuhr, LtcL on A tic. Hist.

vol. i. p. S3, &c.) [L. S.]

MV'SU'S (Miifrios), n tributary of the Cakus, on

the frontiers of My.sia, having its sources on Mount

Trunin-;, and joining the Caicns in the neighbour-

hnod of Pergamum. (Strab. xiii. p. 616.) Ac­

cording to Ovid (J/<7. xv. 277) Mysins was only

another name for Caicus, whence some have interred

t hat the upper part of the Cahus was actually exiled

Mysius. It is generally believed that the My.MUs is

the same as the modern B- rfftna. [L. S.]

MYSOCARAS (Mwo^va?, Ptol. iv. I. § 3),

a hub ur on the W. coast of Mauritania, near the

Phuth, probably the same as the Cakici'S Mi rcm

{KaptKov T€t^ov) of Hanno (p. 2, ed. Hudson;

romp. Ephor. ap. Steph. B. s. v.), now Aghtmi, near

the Wad Tensi/t, where h'ciiou's map of Jfarocco

marks ruins. (Gtog. Grace. Mm. vol. i. p. 4, ed.

Miiller, Paris, 1855.) [E. II. J.]

MYSOMACE'DONES (MorrouaKe'Soi'es), a tribe

of the Mysians, probably occupying the district

about the sources of the small river Mysius. (Ptol.

v. 2. § 15; Plin. v. 31.) In the time of the

liotnans this tribe belonged to the conventus of

Ephesus; but further particulars are not known of

them. [L.S]

MY'STIA (Mu-TTia: Eth. MutTTiavdv: Monusle-

race), a town of Bruttium, whieb seems to have

been situated on the E. coast of that province, be-

t ween Sylacium and tin1 Zephyrian promontory,

apparently not far from Cape Cocinthus (Capo di

Stifa). (Mela, ii. 4. i> 8; Plin. iii. 10. s. 15.)

Stephanas of Byzantium cites Philistus as calling it

a city of the Sainnites, by which be must evidently

mean their Lucaniau or Bruttian descendants. (Steph.

15. s. r.) Its position cannot l»e more exactly deter­

mined, but it is placed conjccturally at Mvnusterace,

near the Capo di Stilo. (Cluver. Itnl. p. 1305;

Romanelli, vol. i. p. 175.) [E. H. II.J

MYTHE'rOHSor MYTHO'I,OElS(;Mt^7j7r0Ais.

MutMiroAij), a town of Bithyuia, of uncertain site,

though it was probably situated on the north-west

side *>f the Lacus Aseania. It is said that during

the winter all the artificial wells of the place were

completely drained of water, but that in summer they

became tilled again to the brim. (Aristot. Mir. Ante.

55; Antig. Caryst. 1SS.) Stephanus Byz. (.-:. p.

rit'OoToAis) and Pliny (v. 43) mention a town

of the name of Pythopolis in Mysia, which may pos-

biblv be the same as Mythopolis. [L. S.l

MYTILE'NEorMlTYLE'XE (MutiX^ or Mt-

TvAiivr): Eth. b\vri\i}vaios or MiTeAr/t'ciios). the

most important city in the island of Lesbos. There

is some uncertainty about the orthography of the

name. Coins are unanimous in favour of Mvn\i]vi).

Inscriptions vary. Greek manuscripts have gene­

rally, but not universally, Miti/A^tj. Latin inanu-

scripts hare generally Mitylene; but YelWhis V*-

terculus, Pomponius Mela, and sometimes Pliny

have Mytilene. In some eases we find the Lx.s

plural form Mitylenae. (Suet. Caes. 2. Tit. 10

Liv. Epit. 89.) Tacitus has the adjective Ho

lenemis (Ann. xiv, 53). It is generally tr*-;

now that the word ought to be written Mvukw

but it does not seem necessary to alter those bh

sagfs where tlie evidence of MSS. j»r( po*ui**r»to lu

other way. A full discussion of this subject mi;

be ,-ieen in Plehn (Iseb'taajrutiiI.ibrr). The raairf

city is called Mitylen, and sometimes Ourro.
