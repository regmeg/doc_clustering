PAROPAMISADAE (n«poTra,uoTaoai or riapu-

7racia-a5a(, Strab. xvi, p. 691, &c. : Diod. xvii. 82;

Arrian, Anab. v. 3; Ptol. vi. IS; Paropamisii,

Mela, i. 2. § 5), the collective name of a number of

small tribes who lived along the spurs of the great

chain of the Paropamisus (Hindu Kush), and chiefly

along its southern ami eastern sides. The dis­

trict they inhabited, which was called generally

■I] Uap<iTaixiud5jji' X^P^ (Arrian, Anab. v. 3), was

bounded on the W. by A nana, on the N. by Bac-

triana, on the E. by the Indus and Punjab, and

on the S. bv Araehosia. It comprehended therefore

the whole of Cabulistan, and a considerable portion

of Afghanistan. The two principal rivers of this

district were tin1 Dargamenea (now Gori) and Co-

phen (Cabul river). The population appears to

have been a free independent mountain race, who

never till the time of Alexander had been compelled

to submit to a foreign ruler. During the Persian

dominion of Asia, as the Paropumisadae are not

mentioned, it may be presumed that they remained

unsubdued. Their chief tribes were the Bolitae

(perhaps Cabolitae, the inhabitants of Cabul), the

Ainbautae, Parsii, and Paryetae or Pargyetae

(Ptol. vi. 18. § 3). Their chief towns were Orto-

spauutn (Cabul), Alexandria (perhaps Bamidri),

Gaiuaca, and Capissa or Caphusa. The valleys

between the mountains, though exposed to great

cold during the winter, were very fertile. (Strab.

xvi. p. 72.") ; Curt. vii. 3. i? 15.) [V.]

Steph. II. s. v.; Paropamisus, Mela, i. 1">. §2; Pi in.

vi. 17. p. 20). a great chain of mountains extending

from about 67° E. long, to 73° E. long., and along

35° N. lat., and forming the connecting link between

the Western Caucasus and the still more eastern

Imaus or Himalaya. Their general modern name

is Hindu Kush, but several of the most remarkable

groups have their own titles: thus the great moun­

tains W. of Cabul are now called Kok-i-Baha, and

those again N. of the Cabul river in the direction

of Jelhilabad bear the title of Kishadha.

The altitude of these mountains, though not so

great as that of the Himalaya, varies from 15,000

to 18.000 feet, It is difficult to determine whence

the Greeks obtained the name whereby they have

recorded these mountains, or which is the best

orthography to adopt. Vet it seems not unlikely

that Ptolemy is the most correct, and that in the

Greek Paropanisus we have some traces of the San-

bcrit SUhadha.

The ancient writers arc by no means clear in

their accounts of these mountains, and there is a

jwrpetual confusion between the Taurus and the

Caucasus. The reason of this no doubt is, that,

till the time of Alexander's invasion they were

altogether unknown to the Greeks, and that then

the officers who described different portions of this

celebrated expedition sometimes considered the In­

dian chain as a continuation of the Taurus, and

sometimes of the Caucasus. Thus Strabo, in one

place, states that the Macedonians called all the

mountains beyond Ariana eastward, Caucasus, but

that among the barbarous people they bore severally

the names of Paropamisus, Emodus, and Imaus

(xi. p. 511) ; in another, he appears to consider the

range which bounded India on the north to be the

j extreme end of Taurus, which extrn<kd to tw

, Eastern Sea (xv. p. 689). Arrian appear* to lav?

thought that Taurus outfit to have b**D tbc tree

| name of these, as he considers this great chaii B

extend across the whole of Asia from M- Mj i-.

I which is opposite to Sainos. (Anab. v. 5.) Ii»

he adds, that it was named Caucasus by tij« Mace­

donian soldiers to gratify Alexander, as thvcrA J

passing into Sogdiana through Bactriana, b-* fcJ

crossed the Caucasus. Under the double run* <*

Taurus and Caucasus, he states his belwi tba; Uu

chain is the watershed of all the great rucrs i

Asia, (f-c.) Again, in another place, be cu&^a

with the description in Strabo, and a*«rU uai lie

Indian names of Paropamisus, E mod as, «

local titles of the extended chain of the laarat

(Ind, 2.) Other ancient authors agree mot* <

leas with these determinations: thus Mela fi**

the whole central chain from E. to W. the raffld

Taurus (i. 15, iii. 7); Curtius calls it Caocaa

(vii. 3. § 19. viii. 9. § 3); Pliny, enutoeratias

several groups from E. to \\\, gives the m-r* a

Caucasus to that portion \\\ of the i/owa £v*

which connects the chain with the Carnal aa

Taurus of Western Asia (vi. 17. s. 21): Pk-letf

appears to have considered the Paropamisus tsi

of the Caucasus (vi. 18. § 1); lastly, Polypi

speaking of the Oxus, states that it derived (I

waters from the Caucasus (x. 46. xi. 32). It fcl

been suggested that the present name of Hi*

Kush is derived from Indicus Caucasus. [V.J

PARU'PUS (ria^ajiros: Eth. Paropinus). a U«
