1074 SYRIA. SYRIA.

Uinia, was situated at the bridge of the Euphrates

in this district, ami was assigned to Commasrene by

Poinpey. Seleueis, otherwise called Tetrapolis, the

best of the before-named districts, was .subdivided

according to the number of its four principal cities,

Seleueis of Pieria, Antioch, Apnmeia, and Laodiceia.

The Orontes flowed from Coelesyru through this

district, having to the east the cities of Bambyce,

Beroea, and Herucleia, and tlie river Euphrates.

Herucleia was 20 stadia distant from the temple

of Athena at Cyrrhestis. This gave its name to

Cyrrhestice which extended as fur as Antiochis to

the south, touched the Amanus on the north, and

was roil term i nous with Commagene on the east, hi

Cyrrhestice were situated Gindarus, its capital, and

near it Heracleuin. Contiguous to Gindarus lay

Pagrae of Antiochis, on the Amanus, above the plain

of Antioch, which was watered by the Arceuthus, the

0routes, the Labotas, and the Oenoparas, in which

was also the camp of Meleager; above these lay the

table mount, Trapezae. On the const were Scleuceia

and Mount Pieria, attached to the Amanus, and

Rhosu* ('Pwrrtif), between Issusand Seleuceia. South

of Antiochis was Apnmeia, lying inland; sooth of

Seleueis Mount Casius and Anticasius: but the

former was divided from Seleuceia by the embouchure

of the Orontes and the rock-hewn temple of Nvm-

phaeum; then Posidium a small town, Heracleia,

Laodiceia, 6lc The mountains east of Laodiceia,

sloping gradually on their west side, had a steeper

Inclination on the east towards Apameia (named by

the Macedonians [Vila) and the Chersonese, as the

rich valley of the Oruiites about that city was called.

Conterminous with the district of Apamene, on the

east, was the country of the phy larch of the Arabs,

named Parapotainia, and Chalcidice, extending from

tb.e Massy as; while the Scenite Arabs also occupied

the south, being less wild and less distinctively Aral's

in proportion as they were brought nearer by position

to the influence* of Syrian civilisation. {Ibid. pp.

749—753.) Then follows the description of the

Coast, which belongs to Phoenicia (sup. p. 600), and

Ins extraordinary mis-statement abont Libanus and

Antihbanus (p. 75;")) alluded to under those articles.

According to this view, the western termination of

I.ibnnus was on the coast, a little to the south of

Tripoli, at a place called &*uvtrp6<Twwovl while Anti-

lib.uius commenced at Sidon. The two ranges then

ran parallel towards the east, until they terminated

in the mountains of the Arabians, above Damascus,

and in the two Trachonea [TkaOHOMITIs]. Be­

tween these two ranges lay the great plain of Coele-

Hyria, divided into several districts, the width at the

sea 200 stadia, the length inland about double the

width; fertilised by rivers, the largest of which was

the Jordan, and having a lake called Gennesaritis

[TiBKitlAS Makk]. The Chrysorrhoas, which rose

near Damascus, was almost wholly absorbed in irri­

gation. The Lycus and Jurdail were navigated by

the A radians. The westernmost of the plains,

along i he sea-border, was called Macra (Mdxpa

T^Sior), next to which was Massyas, with a hilly

district in which Chalets was situated as u kind of

acropolis of the district, which commenced at Lao­

diceia ad Libanum. This billy district was held

by the liuraeans and Arabs [Itukaka]. Above

Massyas was the Royal Plain (AvAwv Boiti Autos)

and the country of Damasc us, followed by the Tra-

chones, &e. (pp. 755, 756). This very confuses! and

inaccurate description has been sufficiently corrected

in the account above given of the Physical Geo­

graphy of Syria, and need not be furtbtrtt'Attd'in

to observe that it is very straoce Unt,if:erMrji»;
