LIBYCUS NOMOS. [Mabmarica.J

LIBYPHOENI'CES (Aigutpo* races, sometimes

•pelt Aifo^oiVtircf). a portion of the population of

N. Africa, who are defined by Livy, in accordance

with the signification of their name, as "mixtum

Puuicum Afris gmiia" (Liv. xxi. 22). Diodorua

gives a somewhat fuller account of them, as one of

the four races who inhabited the Carthaginian terri­

tory in N. Africa, namely, the Punic inhabitants of

Carthage, the LibyPhoenicians, the Libyans, and

the Numidians; and he says that the Libyphoe-

nicians possessed many of the cities on the sea­

shore, and had the tie of intermarriage with the

Carthaginians (Died. xx. 55). Pliny restricts them

to the S. part of the ancient territory of Carthage.

(Plin. v. 4. s.3: Lihypkoenices vocantur qui By-

tncium incohmt); and there can be no doubt, from

the nature of the case, that the original seat of the

race was in the country around Carthage. It is

n<"t, however, equally clear whether the Libyphoc-

nieians of the Carthaginian colonies along the coast

of Africa are to be regarded as a race arising out of

the intermarriage of the original Punic settlers with

the natives of the surrounding country, or as the

descendants of Libyphoenicians from the country

round Carthage, who had been sent out as colonists.

The latter is the more probable, buth from indications

which we find in the ancient writers, and from the

well-known fact that, in all such cases, it is the

half-breed which multiplies rapidly, eo as to make

it a matter of importance for the members of the

pure and dominant caste to find a vent for the in­

creasing numbers of the race below them. That

such was the policy of Carthage with regard to

the Libyphoenicians, and moreover that they were

marked by the energy and success which usually

distinguishes such half-bred races, we have some

interesting proofs. The defence of Agrigentutn

against the Komans, during the Second Punic War,

was signalised by the skill and energy of Mutines,

a Lihyphiienician of Hipponium, whom Livy de­

scribes as "vir impiger, et &tb Hannibale mnyutvo

omnet belli arte* edoctus" (Liv. xxv. 40). The

mention of his native place, Hipponium, on the

Itrnttian coast, a city which had been for some time

in the hands of the Carthaginians, is a proof of the

tendency to make use of the race in their foreign

settlements; while the advantage taken by Hannibal

of his talents agrees with the fact that he employed

Libyphoenician cavalry in his armies. (Polyb. iii.

S3; Lir. xxi. 22.) Niebuhr has traced the pre­

sence of Libyphoenician* in the Punic settlement*

in Sardinia, and their further mixture with the

Sardinians, as attested by Cicero in an interesting

fragment of his speech fur Scauru*. {Lecture* on

Anc Geog. vol ii. p. 275.) Avienos mentions the

"wild Linvphoeniciana" on the S. coast of Spain,

E. of Calpe. (Or. Mar. 419.) Perhaps the half-

bred race* of the Spanish colonies in America fumi.sh

the closest analogy that can be found to the Liby-

phoenician subject* of Carthage. [P. S.]

L1BYSSA (AisVrcra or Ai*«r<ra. Ptolr. 1. § 13:

Eth. Ai6vc<tcuos), a town on the north coast of the

as the place containing the tomb of Ibe great Han­

the town of Libyssa, a river of Phrygia wa* called

Liby si us, and he states that from it the sur­

rounding country received the name of Libvu*.

The slight resemblance between the name Liby**

and the modern Ghebse has led some geograpU«-r»

to regard the latter as the site of the ancient town;

but Leake (Asia Minor, p. 9), from an accurate

computation of distances, has shown that the moJrn

LICATII, or LICATTII (Aocdrtoi, or Aunfmai),

a tribe of the VindeUci, dwelling on the banks of lite

river Licias or Lie us, from which they derived tiiw

name. (Ptol. it 13. § 1.) Strabo (iv. p. 206)

mentions them among the most audacious of tb*

Vindelician tribes. Pliny (iii. 24), who calls ti;ern

Licates, enumerates them among the Alpine tribe*

subdued by Augustus. [L. S.]

LI'CHADES (al Atx<&<i), a group of three
