SKT1A (Sijria: Ktk. Setinus: Sraee), an ancient

r» oi Latium, situated on the S. slope of the Vol-

between Nurba and Privernum,

the Pontine Marshes. It is probable

i: it was originally a Latin city, as its name is

ami in the list given by Dionysius of the thirty

up. J the Latin League. (Dionys. v. 61.) But

3.uj-t have fallen into the hands of the Volscians,

tlx? lime their power was at its height. No

'Rtjoo of it is, however, fonnd during the wars of

• Kunana with that people until after the Gaulish

'iM'tfi, when a Rinnan colony was established there

a. c 392, and recruited with an additional body

aimisU a few years afterwards. (Veil. Pat. i.

I; Lir. vL SO.) At this time Setia must have

•n the most advanced point of the Roman dominion

ihw direction, and immediately adjoined the ter-

■ of the I'riremates, who were still an inde-

adeot and powerful people. [Pkiveksusi.] This

^■trsj the new colonists to the incursions of that

as that of Norba. (Liv. vii. 42, viii. 1.)

ar (a. c 209). declared its inability to furnish

i further supplies either of men or money. (Liv.

tu. 9.) It was, at a later period of the war,

r»T.T pinisbed for this by the imposition of much

itt contributions. (Id. xxix. 15.) From its

wg and somewhat secluded position, Setia was

rr'.oi jus the place where the Carthaginian hos-

Cai, given at the close of the war, were detained

custody, and in n.«'. 198 became in consequence

> wne of a very dangerous conspiracy among the

t-, of that an>l the adjoining districts, which whs

[(.rnvd by the energy of the praetor L. Cor­

ns Mania. (Id- xxsii. 26.) From this time

bear no more of Setia till the Civil Wars of

l-si and Sulla, when it was taken by the latter

i It appears therefore to have been at this

period a strong fortress, an advantage which it

owed to its position on a hill as well as to its forti­

fications, the remains of which are still visible.

Under the Empire Setia seems to have continued to

be a flourishing municipal town, but was chiefly

celebrated for its wine, which in the days of Martial

and Juvenal seems to have been esteemed one of

the choicest and most valuable kinds: according to

Pliny it was Augustus who first brought it into

vogue. (Plin. xiv. 6. s. 8; Martial, x. 36. 6,

xiii. 112; Juv. x. 27; Strab. v. pp. 234, 237; Sil.

Ital. viii. 379.) We learn from the Liber Coloniarum

that Setia received a colony under the Triumvirate;

and it is probable that it subsequently bore the title

of a Colonia, though it is not mentioned as such by

Pliny. (Plin. iii. 5. a. 9; Lib. Colon, p. 237;

Orel!. Inter. 2246; Zumpt, <fe Colon, p. 338.)

The position of Setia on a lofty hill, looking down

upon the Pontine Marshes and the Appian Way, is

alluded to by several writers (Strab. v. p. 237;

Martial,x. 74. 11, xiii. 112), among others in a

fragment of Lucilius (ap. A. Cell. xvi. 9), in whose

time it is probable that the highroad, of the ex­

treme hilliness of which he complains, passed by

Setia itself. It was, however, about 5 miles distant

from the Appian Way, on the left hand. There

can be no doubt that the modern town of Sezze

occupies the same site with the ancient one, as ex­

tensive remains of its walls are still visible. They

are constructed of large polygonal or rudely squared

blocks of limestone, in the same style as those of

Nurba and Cora. The substructions of several

ediflces (probably temples) of a similar style of

construction, also remain, as well as some incon­

siderable ruins of an amphitheatre. (Westphul,
