Mogontiamm in Lower Germania,but it was the chief

place of Upper Germania. Ptolemy has Dot men­

tioned the Mosella (Moscl), and some geographers

have assumed that it is tlie Obringas; but it this is

so, t he position of Mainz is wrong in Ptolemy, for

Mainz is south of the Motel. D'Anville observes

that, according to the Xotit. Imp., the district of

the general who resided at Mainz comprehended

Antunnacum or Andc-rnach, on the Rhine., which is

behiw the junction of the Motel and the Rhine, If

Andernach was always in the Upper *icrmania, and

if the boundary between the Lower and the Upper

Gennania was a river-valley, there is none that

seems so likely to have been selected as the rugged

valley of the Ahr, width lies between Bonn and

Andernach, and separates the netherhmds or low­

lands on the north from the hilly country on the

south. [G. L.]

300 stadia according to Strabo (p. 160). It had the

Kth. 'nwaA(us), an ancient city of Boeotia, men­

tioned by Ilniner, situated upon a small stream of

the same name, at an equal distance from Haliartus

and Alalcoinenae. It lay in the middle of a long

narrow plain, bounded on the east by the height* uf

Haliartus, on the west by the mountain Tilphossium,

on the BOUth by a range of low hills, and on the

north by the lake Copais. This town was dependent

upon Haliartus. The name is probably only a dia­

lectic form of Oechalia. Its site is indicated by'

several squared blocks on the right hank of the

stream. (Horn. //. ii. 501, Hymn. ApolL 242;
