1204 TIBVR. TIBUK.

Nibby holds that it is nut anterior to the 4th cen­

tury of our era, its construction resembling that ot'

the villa of Maxentius on the Via Appia. There

are traces of painting of the 13th century, showing

that then, if not previously, it was a Christian

church. A little further on we come to an inscrip­

tion which records the levelling of the Clivus Tibur-

tinus in the time of Constantius and Constans. The

mime of the latter is purposely effaced, no doubt by

tlie order of Magnentius. This monument was dis­

covered in 1736, and re-erected by order of the ma­

gistrates uf Tibtur at the same spot w here it was

found.

The delightful country in the vicinity of Tibur

caused many villas to be erected there during the

latter period of the Republic and under the first

Caesars, as we see from the writings of Catullus,

Horace, Propertius, Statius, and other pcets. Of

these villas, however, of which we shall mention only

the more interesting, there are but few remains, and

scarcely any that can be identified with certainty.

The most striking are those commonly called the

villa of Maecenas on the SW. side of the town, near

the Cascatelle. Ligorio was the 6rst who called

this building the ulla of Maecenas; but there is no

authority for the assumption. It was probably

founded on a wrong conception of a passace in

Horace (Otl. iii. 29. 6, seq.), which is also quoted

hv Mr. Cramer (Italy, vol. ii. p. 60) under a misap­

prehension that it contains an allusion to a residence

possessed by Maecenas at Tibur, instead of to his

I own-house on the Ksquiliiie. The plan of this

building published by Marquez and Uggeri is correct.

It was founded on gigantic suhstructions, the magni­

tude of which may be best observed on the N. side,

or that towards the valley of the Anio. It is an

immense quadrilateral edifice, f>37j feet long, and

450 broad, surrounded on three sides by sumptuous

porticoes. The fourth side, or that which looks

towards Rome, which is one of the long sides, had a

theatre in the middle of it, with a hall or saloon on

each side. The porticoes are arched, and adorned

on the side towards the area with half columns uf the

l>oric order. Behind is a series of chambers. An

oblong tumulus now marks the site ot the house, or.

a.-coi'ding to Nibby, who regards it as the temple of

Hercules, of the Cella. The pillars were of traver­

tine, and of a beautiful Ionic order. One of them

still existed on the ruins as late as 1S12. This im­

mense building intercepted the ancient road, fur

which, as appears from an inscription preserved in

the Vatican, a vault or tunnel was constructed, part

ot which is still extant. Hence it gave name to the

Pttrta Scura, or Obscura, mentioned in the Bull of

Benedict, which it continued to bear at least as late

as the 15th century.

To our apprehension, the plan here laid down is

rather that of a palace or villa, than of a temple,

nor do we perceive the resemblance, insisted on by

Nibby, to the temple of Fortune at Praeneste. It is

not probable that the chief fane of Hercules, the

jiatron deity of 'Jil-tir. should have been erected

outside tlie town, nor would it have been a convenient

spot for Augustus to administer justice, as we have

mentioned that he did in his frequent retirements to

Tibur, in the porticoes of the temple of Hercules.

Tlie precincts of the Forum would have been more

adapted to such a purpose, but if that emperor so

much frequented Tibur, evidently the favourite among

all his country retreats (Suet. I.e.), he must have

hud a suitable residence for his reception. Alight

not this villa have been his pa law? N7^br-

observes that the style of buikiir-Cbcf li* V-r.> .:
