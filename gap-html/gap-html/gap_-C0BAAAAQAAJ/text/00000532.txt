537.) In Strabo's time it was called Neroassus

(Nypnaaaos). and served as a treasury to Sicinus,

who was striving to obtain the sovereignty of Cap-

padocia, [*L. S.J

NOKBA (Nwfj&x: Nwpgoi-or, Norbanus:

Aormrt), an ancient city of Latiuin, situated on the

border of the Yolseian mountains, overlooking the

Pontine .Marshes, and about midway between Cora

and Setia. There seems no doubt that Norba was

an ancient Latin city; its name is found in the list

given by Dionysius of the thirty cities of the League;

and again, in another passag<\ lie expressly calls it

a city of the Latin na'ion. (Dionys. v. 61, vii. 13;

Niebuhr, vol. ii. note 21.) It appeal's, indeed, cer­

tain that all the three cities, Cora, Norba, and

Setia, were originally Latin, before they fell into

the hands of the Volscians. The statement that

Norba received a fresh colony in b. C- 402. imme­

diately after the conclusion of the league of Borne

with the Latins, points to the necessity, already felt,

of strengthening a position of much importance,

winch was well calculated, as it is expressed by

Livy, to be the citadel of the surrounding country

("quae arx in Pomptino csset," Li v. ii. 34; Dionys.

vii. 13). But it seems probable that Norba, as well

as the adjoining cities of Cora and Setia, fell into

the hands of the Volscians during the height of

their p'>wer, anil received a fresh colony on the

breaking up of the latter. (Niebuhr, vol. ii. p. 108.)

For it is impossible to believe that these strong

fortresses had continued in the hands of the Romans

and Latins throughout their wars with the Vol­

scians so much nearer home; while, on the other

hand, whim their names reappear in history, it is as

ordinary " coloniae Latinae," and not as independent

cities. Hence none of the three are mentioned in

the great Latin War of n. <:. 340, or the settlement

of affairs by the treaty that followed it. But, just

before the breaking out of that war, and again in

R. c. 327, we find the territories of Cora, Norba, and

Setia ravaged by their neighbours the Privernates,

whose incursions drew upon them the vengeance of

Koine. (Liv. vii. 42, viu. 1.19.) No further men­

tion occurs of Norba till the period of the Second

Punic War, when it was one of the eighteen Latin

colonies which, in b. c. 209, expressed their readi­

ness to bear the continued burthens of the war, and

to whose fidelity on this occasion Livy ascribes the

preservation of the Roman state, (Liv. xxvii. 10.)

It seems to have been chosen, from its strong and

secluded position, as one of the places where the

Carthaginian hostages were kept, and, in consequence,

was involved in the servile conspiracy of the year

C. c. 198, of which the neighbouring town of Setia

was the centre. (Liv. xxxii. 2, 26.) [Sbtia.]

Norba played a more important part during the

civil wars of Marias and Sulla; having leen occu­

pied by the partisans of the former, it was the last |

city of Italy that held out, even after the fall of

Praeneste and the death of the younger Marius,

r.. <". 82. It was at last betrayed into the hands

of Aemilius Lepidus, the general of Sulla; but the

garrison put themselves and the other inhabitants

to the sword, and set fire to the town, which was

so entirely destroyed that the conquerors could carry

off no booty. (Appian, B. C. i. 94.) It seems cer­

tain that it was never rebuilt: Strabo omits all'

notice of it, where he mentions all the other towns

that bordered the Pontine Marshes (v. p. 237); and, |

though Pliny mentions the Norbani anwir ti»

existing *• populi" of Latiuin. in another j ■--

reckons Norba among the cities that in his ur*

had altogether disappeared (iii. 5. s. 9. lU 64. (W

tinned by the evidence of the existine reu-j:r*.
