Ozolian Locrians, and on the S. by tlic Corinthian

gulf. The Phoeians at one period of their history

possessed a sea-port, Daphnus, on the Euboean sea,

intervening between the Locri Epicneinidii and

Opuntii (Strab. x. pp. 424, 425.) Phoeis is a

mountainous country. The greater part of it is oc­

cupied by the lofty and rugged range of Parnassus,

the lower portion of which, named Cirpliis, descends

to the Corinthian gulf betweenCirrlia and Anticyra:

below Cirpliis was the fertile valley of Crissa, ex­

tending to the Corinthian gulf. On the XE. and E.

were the Locrian mountains, lofty and difficult of

access on the side of the Epicneinidii, but less pre­

cipitous on the side of the Opuntii. [Locris.]

Between Mount Parnassus and the Locrian moun­

tains flowed the river Cephissus, which empties itself

into the kike Copais in Iioeotia. [Boeotia, p. 410,

seq,] In the valley of the Cephissus are some narrow

but fertile plains. The only other rivers in Phocis,

besides the Cephissus and its tributaries, an.1 the

Pleistus, flowing by Delphi [Delphi], and the He*

racleius, flowing into the Corinthian gulf near Bulis.

[Bl'LIS.]

Phocis is said to have been originally inhabited

by several of those tribes who formed the population

of Greece before the ap]tearancc of the Hellenes.

Ammig the earliest inhabitants we rind mention of

Leleges (Dieaearch. p. 5), Thracians (Strab. ix.

p. 401; Thuc. ii. 29; comp. Pans. i. 41. § 8), and

Ilyantes. (Strab. /. c.) The aboriginal inhabitants

were conquered by the Phlegyae from Orchomenus.

(Paus viii. 4. §4, x. 4. § 1.) The country around

Tithorea and Delphi is said to have been first called

Phocis from Phoeus, a son of Ornytion, and grandson

of Sisyphus of Corinth: and the name is said to have

been afterwards extended to the whole country from

Phocus, a son of Aeaeus, who arrived there not long

afterwards (Pans. ii. 29. § 3, x. 1. § 1.) This

statement would seem to show that the Phoeians

were believed to be a mixed Aeolic and Achaean

race, as Sisyphus was one of the Aeolie heroes, anil

Aeaeus one of the Achaean. In the Trojan War

the inhabitants appear under the name of Phoeians,

and were led against Troy by Schedins ami Epis­

tropheus, the Sims of rphitus. (Horn. Ii ii. 517.)

Phocis owes its chief importance in history to the

celebrated oraele at Delphi, which originally belonged

to the Phoeians. Hut after the Dorians had ob­

tained possession of the temple, they disowned their

connection with the Phoeians: and in historical

times a violent antipathy existed between the Pho­

t-inns and Delphians. [Dklihi, p. 762.]

The Phoeians proper dwelt chiefly in small towns

situated upon either side of the Cephissus. They

formed an ancient confederation, which assembled in

a building named Phocicum, near Daulis. (Paus.

x. 5. § 1.) They maintained their independence

against the Thessalians, who made several attempts

to subdue them before the Persian War, and upon

one occasion they inflh ted a severe loss upon the

Thessalians near Hyampolis (Herod, viii. 27, seq.;

Paus. x. 1.) When Xerxes invaded Greece, the

Thessalians were able to wreak their vengeance upon

their ancient enemies. They conducted the Persian

army into Phocis, and twelve of the Phoc'i.in cities

were destroyed by the invaders. The inhabitants

had previously escaped to the summits of Parnassus

or across the mountains into the territory of the

Locri Ozulae. (Herod, viii. 32, seq.) Some of the

Phuciaiis were subsequently compelled to serve in the

army of Maidonius, but those who had taken refuge

on Mt. Pamassns sallied from their fastmw n

antioved the Persian army. (Herod, ix. 17, 31
