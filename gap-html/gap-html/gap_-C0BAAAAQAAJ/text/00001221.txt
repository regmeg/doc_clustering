T11APSA. [Rl'SIRAIIK.]

THA'PSACUS (BduVaxos), a town of considerable

'[iirum-c on the right bank of the Euphrates, in

•I. 35° 15' N. It is mentioned very early in

Lia-ient history, and ia almost certainly tiie same as

t Tiphuh, of the Old Testament (1 Kin/ft, iv. 24;

n ifjr LXX. written 0aifa), which is mentioned us

m i-astem boundary of the kingdom of Solomon,

d-re ia some difference among ancient writers as to

'<■ i rivince iu which it should be included. Thus,

'mr (v. 24. a. 21) and Stephnnu* B. (». r.) place

1 iu Syria; Ptolemy (v. 19. § 3) in Arabia Deserta.

Ir r*%Mm of this is, that it was a frontier town,

>«: uupht therefore be claimed as belonging to one

r more provinces. At Thapsacus was the most

<j"runt passage of the Euphrates in the northern

<n«o of that river's course. As such, we read

vts used by Cyrus the younger, whose anny

rdod it, the water reaching up to their breasts,

• n- being probably at that time no bridge. (Xen.

mo. i. 4. § 11.) Some years later Dareius

■ ^<\! it to meet Alexander in Cilicia, ami rccrossed

in Lute after his defeat at Issus. (Arrian, ii. 13.)

blander, pursuing Dareius, crossed the river also

'lie same spot, as the historian especially notices,

two bridges (probably of boats), which were

ire J together (iii. 7). Strabo, who makes frequent

l>.o of Thapsacus, considers it, on the authority

I r itosthenes, as distant from llabylon about 4800

ma, and from Cominagene 2000 (ii. pp. 77, 78,

in. p. 746); and states that it was situated

'. that sjiot where Mesopotamia is the widest

). There is no doubt that it derived its name

'a Semitic verb, meaning to pass over (Winer,

H iTtcrb. $. r.): hence another passage-place

• i r unie name, which ia mentioned in 2 A'tn^s,

10. but which is really in Palestine, has been

m confounded with Tiphsah on the Euphrates.

/ states that the name was changed by tho

*'.Ionian Greeks to Amphipulis (v. 24. s. 21),  
: .Nrtitanus calls the Ampliipolis of Seleucns Tour-

■U. No trace of any of these names is now found

:he cnontry (Ritler, x. p. 1114). nor any ruins

if can certainly be identified with its site. It was,

"rver, probablv near the present Ittir. [V.]

IUAPSIS (ea+n, Uiodor. xx. 23), a deep river

the Cbersonetus Taurica, on which lay a royal

tie. L'kert (iii. 2. p. 193) identifies it with the

•.>*■. But Kohler seeks the castle on Mount

45 wersts south of Kertsch. (Ali'm. dt V.\c.

rHAl'al!S(e<ul«j, l'tol. iv. 3. § 10), a maritime

1 > i ityxacijm, in Africa Propria. It lay on a

ike, which, according to Shaw (TVotr. p. 99),

'iUt», and on a point of land 80 stadia distant

in tile opposite island of Lopadussa. Thapsus

^-naicJy fortified and celebrated for Caesar's vio

r over the Pumpcians, n. c. 46. (Hirt. B. Af.

••"■l ) Shaw (/. c.) identities it with the present

muul, where its ruins are still visible. (Cf.

l u. jr»H, pp. 6.31, 834 ; Liv. xxxiii. 48; Plin.

I %. a. Sc.) [T. U. D.]

i HAFSUS, a river of Namidia, falling into the

the tYiwn of RuMCnde, probablv the present

H AI'SUS [SYBACl'HAlt]

ilAWRANA, a place on the great line of road

■ ■* IsnJ arrosa the desert from the Euphrates to

tie {ALIIalkr). It is marked on the Tabula

Penlingeriana. It has been conjectured hy Mannert

(v. 2. p. 233) that the name is a mistake for

Charrana, another form of Charrae; but this hypo­

thesis seems hardly tenable, lteichard believes it is

represented by the present braids). [V.]

THAItRAS(ed#«, Ptol.: Ru. at Capo del Sero).

a city of Sardinia, mentioned only by Ptolemy (where

the name is written iu many MSS. and editions

Tarrae or Tan-as) and in the Itineraries, but which

seems to have been one of the most considerable

places in the island. It was situated on the W.

coast, on a projecting point of land at the N. ex­

tremity of the Gulf of Oristano, where its ruins

are still visible, though half buried in sand, and

numerous minor antiquities have been discovered.

Prom its position there can be little doubt that it

was a Phoenician or Carthaginian settlement; but

continued to be a considerable town under the Ro­

mans, and an inscription records the repair of the

road from Tharru to Comus as late as the reign

of the emperor Philip. (l)e la Marmora, 1'oy. ru

Sardaipu, vol. ii. pp. 359, 477.) The Antonine

Itinerary correctly places it 18 miles from Conius

and 12 from Oilioca (Ihriitanu). (/tin. Ant. p. 84;

Ptol. iii. 3. § 8.) [E. H. I!.]

THAUSANDAI.A (eapadVSaAa), a town in

Thrace, between Byzantium and the wall of Anas-

tasius, which was one of the numerous places forti­

fied by Justinian. (Procop. tie Aed. iv. 11. p. 305,

Bonn.) According to lteichard, Etatakta now oc­

cupies its site. [J. R]

THASOS (8ttVor, sometimes SoWof: Kth.

Barrios: Thato or 7'asso), an island in the N. of

the Aegacan sea, off the coast of Thrace, and dis­

tant only 3\ miles from the plain of the river

Ncstns or Kara-Su. It was distant half a day's

sail from Amphipnlis (Thuc. iv. 104), and 32 miles

from Abdera. (Plin. iv. 12. s. 23.) It was u1m>

called Aerin or Aethra (Plin. /. c; Steph. II. s. r.)

and Chryse, from its gold mines (Eustath. ad

Oionys. Per. 517), which were the chief source of

the prosperity of the island. The earliest known

inhabitants of Thasos were the Phoenicians, who

were doubtless attracted to the island by its valu­

able mines, but who are said to have come thither

in search of Europe, five generations More the

birth of the Grecian Hercules. They were led by

Thasos, the son of Agenor, from whom the island

derived its name. (Herod, ii. 44, vi. 47; Paus. v.

25. § 12; Scymn. 660; Conon, c 37; Steph. It.

$. «.) Thasos was afterwards colonised in Ol. l.r>

or 18 (n.c. 720 or 708) by settlers from Paros, led

by Tilcsicles, the father of the poet Arclulorhus.

(Thuc. iv. 104; Strab. ix. p. 487; Clem. Alex.

Strom, i. p. 144; Euseb. Prarp. />. vi. 7.) There

also existed nt that time in tlie island a Thracian

tribe called Saians, with whom the Parian settlers

carried on war, hut not always successfully; and on

ono occasion Archilochus was obliged to throw away

his shield. (Archiloch. Fragm. 5, ed. Schneidewin;

Arisloph. Pac. 1298, with the Nchnl.) The (Ircek

colony rapidly rose in power, and obtained valuable

pos>c*sions on the adjoining mainland, which con­

tained even richer mines than those in the islam).

Shortly before the Persian invasion, the clear sur­

plus revenue of the Thasians was 200, and some­

times even 300 talents yearly (46,000/., 66.000/.),

of which Scapte Hy 1C |iroduced 80 talents, ami I lie

mines in the island rather less. (Herod, vi. 4fi.)

Besides Sea pie Hyle the Thosians also possessed

upon the mainland Galcpsns and Uesvma( l liuc iv.
