S68 MOX5SL MOGETIANA.

Tinuicbi by the river Timachm The Triconesii,

who derived their name from Tricornum, were on

the confines of Dahnatia. The l'eueini inhabited

the inland uf l'eure, at the mouth of the Danube.

The Thraces were near their own country; the

Scorduci, between the Dardani ami Dalmatia. The

Moesi, or My si, proper, inhabited the heart of the

Country to which they pave their name, on the

banks of the rtver Ciabrus. [A. L.]

. MOGETIANA or MOGENTIANA, a place in

Lower Pannouia, on the road from Sopiauac to

Sauaria. (It. Ant. pp. 203,233.) Its exact site is

uncertain. [L. S.]

MiXiONTIACUMor MAGONTIACUM (Mainz),

a city of Gallia, on the Rhine. On this spot was

built a monument in honour of Drusus the father of

Germanicua. (Eutrop. vii. 13.) Magontiacum, as

it is written in the text of Tacitus, is often men­

tioned in the history of the war of Civilis. (Tacit.

Hist. iv. 15, 24, &c.) Ptolemy (ii. 9. § 14) writes

the name yiuKovriaK6v, and places tlie town in

Germania Inferior. In Eutropius the form of the

word is Hogontiacnm (ed. Verheyk); but the MSS.

have also the forms Maguntia and Mognntia, whence

is easily derived the French form Mayence, and tlie

German Mainz. The position of Mogontiacum at

Mainz on tlie Rhine is determined by tlie Itins.

which place it 18 H. P. from Bingiam (Bingeti),

also on tlie Rhine. It was an im[»ortaut position

under the Roman empire, but no great events are

connected with the name. Ammianus Marcellinus

(xv. 11) calls it a Munieipium, which means a town

that hail a Iioman form of administration. [G. L.]

MUGUUS (Vlwypoi), a navigable river in Colchis,

flowing into the Kuxine between tlie Pbasis in the

north, and the Isis in the south; its mouth is just

midway between the two, bein^ 'JO stadia distant

from each. (Arrian, PerifiL Pont. Eux. p. 7; Win.

vi. 4.) As an ancient reading in Pliny is

Noprus, and the Table has Niprus, it is possible

that the real name of tlie river may have been No-

grus, and that in Arrian also we must read Nu>-

ypos. [L. S.]

MOLADA (Ma-\aSa), a town of Palestine,

reckoned among the uttermost cities of the tribe

of Judah toward the coast of Edom southward

(Joshua, xv. 21. 26), and indeed in that part which

fell to the tribe of Simeon, " whose inheritance was

within the inheritance of the children of Judah.11

(lb. xix. 1, 2; 1 Chron. iv. 24. 28.) Reland re­

marks, " Videtur esse eadem ac Malatha"' (Palne.it.

t. ft p. 901.), which Malatha is mentioned by Jo-

•ephus as a castle of Idumaea, to which Apri^pa.the

son of Ariltobulun and son-in-law of Herod the Great,

retired in his distress after his return from Rome, and

where he meditated suicide. (Ant. xviii. 7. $ 2.) It

is mentioned also by Eusebius and S. Jerome as

iv. M. 1'. distant from Arad ('Aj>a,ua)> which they

describe as an ancient city of the Anionics, situated in

the wilderness of Kadcsh (KceSStji). xx. M.l*. from

Hebron, on the road to Ada. (Onomast. s. vv.

'Apaud, 7A<ra<rav &andi>- Reland, J'afaestiiM, s. v.

Malatha, pp. 885, 886.) The site of Arad is still

marked by a ruin of the same name, at the required

distance S. of H'-bron; near to which are wells and

ruins named Kl MiUt, which L>r. Robinson " was

disposed to regard as marking the site of the an­

cient Moladah of the Old Testament, tlie Malatha

of the Greeks and Boinam>." (Lib. U>.<. vnl. ii.

MOLINDAE (Plin. vi. 19. s. 22), a people mcn-
