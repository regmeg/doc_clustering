D'Anville says that in the middle age writings tlie

name of the river is Olna, which is easily changed

into Ome. Gosselin supposei the (Mints to be the

OL IN TIG I, a maritime town of Hispania Bar-

tica. lying E. of Onoba. (Mela. iii. 1. § 4.) Its

real name seems to have been Olontigi, as many

coins nre found in the neighbourhood bearing the

inscription oloxt. (Florez,Med. ii. pp. 405, 50'.*,

iii. p. 103; Mionnet, Sup. i. p. Ill, ap. Ukert, vol.

guar and Palo*. [T. H. D.]

OLISIPO ('Okioofiirm; Ptol. ii. 5. § 4), a city

of Lusitania, on the right bank of the Ta^us, and

not far from its mouth. The name is variously

written. Thus Pliny (iv. 35) has Olisippo; so also

the /fin. Ant. pp. 4*1 G, 418, sc«j. In Mela (iii. 1.

§ G), Solinns (c 23), &c, we find Ulyseippo, on ac­

count probably of the legend mentioned in Strmbo,

which ascribed its foundation to Ulysses, but winch

is more correctly referred to Odysseia in Hispania

Baetiea. [OdysSEIA.] Under the Romans it was

a nmuicipium, with the additional name of Felieitas

Julia. (Plin. I. c.) The neighbourhood of Olisipo

was celebrated for a breed of hones of remarkable

fleet ness, Which pave rise to the fable that the mares

were impregnated by the west wind. (Plin. viii. 67;

Yarr. A*. A', ii. 1, 19; Col. vi. 27.) It is the

modem Lisbon or Lisbon. [T. II. IX]

OLI'ZON (*OXi(«V: Etk. 'OAifaWi), an ancient

who gives it the epithet of " mpped." (Horn. //. ii.

717.) It possessed a harbour (Scylax, p. 25); and

as it was opposite Artemisium in Buboes (I'lut.

Than. 8), it is placed by Leake on the isthmus

connecting the peninsula of Trikkiri with the rest

of Mapiesia, (Strab. ix. p. 4.'J6; Plin. iv. 9. s. 1G;

O'LLIUS (jOgUo)) a river of Cisalpine Gaul, and

MM of the more considerable of the northern tribu­

foot of the Monte Tonale, flows through the Vol

Cumonictt (the district of the ancient Camuni), and

forms the extensive lake called by Pliny the Lac us

Sebinus, now the Logo d' hto. Prom thence it has

a course of about 80 miles to the Padus, receiving

on its way the tributary streams of the Mela or

MfUn, and the Clusius or C/ium: Thomrh one of

the most important rivers of this part of Italy, its

name is mentioned only by Pliny and the Geogra­

pher of Ravenna. (Pirn. iii. 1G. s. 20. 19. s. 23;

tained nothing worthy of notice in the time of I'au-
