PHAZE'ilON (+afi)f»!6i'), a small town in the

according to Hamilton (li&earchet, i. p. 333). nre

the modern baths of Cauvga. (Strab. xii. pp. 553,

560, 561.) Pompey, after his victory over Mithri-

dates, planted a colony there, and changed it* ninne

into Neapolis, from which the whole district was

called Neapolitis, having previously been called Pha-

zemonitis. (Strab. xii. p. 560; Steph. B. t. v. *a-

pti^uK, for thus the name is erroneously written.)

Phazemon is generally supposed to correspond in

t. v.: Eih. 4*«txT7ir, Steph. B.), a city of Elis in the

Pisatis, situated upon the isthmus connecting the

promontory Ichthys (C of KaMkolo) with the

mainland. Strabo erroneously speaks of two pro­

montories upon this part of the coast; one called

Pheia, from the name of the neighbouring town, and

another more to the south, of which he has not

given the name. (Strab. viii. 343.) Pheia is men­

tioned by Homer, who places it near the Iardanus,

which is apparently the mountain torrent north of

Ichthys, and which flows into the sea on tlie northern

side of the lofty mountain Skaq>hidi. (Horn. /. c.)

Upon a very conspicuous peaked height upon tho

isthmus of Ichthys are the ruins of a castle of the

middle ages, called Pontikekattro, built upon the

remains of the Hellenic walls of Pheia. On either

side of Ichthys are two harbours; the northern one,

which is a small creek, was the port of Pheia; tho

southern one is the broad bay of Katakolo, which is

now much frequented, but was too open and exposed

fbr ancient navigation. The position of these har­

bours explains the narrative of Thncydides, who

relates that in the first year of the Peloponnesinn

War (n. c. 431), the Athenian fleet, having sailed

from Methone in Messenia, landed at Pheia (tliat is,

in the bay of KatAkoki), and laid waste the country;

but a storm having arisen, they sailed round the

promontory Ichthys into the harbour of Pheia. In

front of the harbour was a small island, which Poly-

bius calls Pheias (Strab. /. c.; Polyb. iv. 9). About a

mile north of the small creek at Pontikokattro, there

ia a harbour called Khortiu, which Leake is disposed

to identify with the port mentioned by Thurvdides,

on the ground that the historian describes it 4' not as

the port of Pheia, but as a harbour in tlie district

Pheia" (ihv iv rp 4>8eici Ki/iiya); but we think it

more probable that the historian intended the civek

at the foot of PonHkokastro. In any case Pheia

stood on the isthmus of Ichthys, and neither at

Khar tut nor at the mouth of the torrent of Hkejiiiili,

at one or other of which spt>ts Pheia is placed by

Boblaye, though at neither are there any ancient re­

mains. (Leake, Morca, vol. ii. p. 189, seq., PeIo~

pontmsiaca, p. 213, seq.; Boblaye, h'c'eherr/iet, (fc.
