hopes that the king would conform himfelf to the BOOK

manners and inftitutions of his grandfather. In con-

fequence of which, the Latines, with whom a treaty

had been concluded in the reign of Tullus, aflTumed

new courage, and made an incurfion into the Ro­

man territories; and, when the Romans demanded

fatisfa&ion, returned a haughty anfwer, imagining

the Roman king fo averfe to action, that he would

fpend his reign among the chapels and altars. The

genius of Ancus was of a middle kind, between

"a public mefienger of the Roman people. I

"come, an ambaflador duly authorized, according
