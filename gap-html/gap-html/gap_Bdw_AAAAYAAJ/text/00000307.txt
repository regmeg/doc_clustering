and, afterwards, to two heavy calamities which fell BOOK

on them at once, famine and peftilence, making^. _^J -,

dreadful havock among both men and cattle. The Y.R. 301.

country was defolated, the city exhaufted, by a con- B. c.+il.

tinual fuccefilon of deaths. Many illuftrious houfes

were in mourning: Servilius Cornelius Flamen Qui-

rinalis died, and Caius Horatius Pulvillus augur,

in whofe room the augurs elected Caius Veturius,

with the greater fatisfaction, becaufe he had been

condemned by the commons. The conful Quinti-

lius died, and four tribunes of the people. Such a

multiplicity of loffes made it a melancholy year, but

there was no difturbance from any enemy. The Y. R. 3«'.

next confuls were Caius Menenius and Publius Sef- 'C' 45°"

with the Athenian laws, and the tribunes therefore

prefied, more earneftly, that the bufinefs of com­

piling the laws might at laft be begun. It was re-

iblved, that ten magiftrates, to be called decemvirs,

fhoukl be created, from whom no appeal mould lie,

and that there mould be no pther magiftrates during

that year. It was difputed for fome time, whether

plebeians mould be admitted among them. At laft,

that point was given up to the patricians, provided

that the Icilian law concerning the Aventine, and

others, called the devoting laws, mould not be re­

pealed.

XXXIII. IN the three hundredand firft year, from

the building of Rome, the form of the government

underwent a fecond change; the fupreme power

being transferred from confuls to decemvirs, as it had

formerly been from kings to confuls. This new form

was lefs remarkable, becaufe it was not of long dura­

tion; for the happy beginnings of that government ter­

minated in extravagant licentioufnefs, which haftened

its difibludon j and recourfe was had to the former
