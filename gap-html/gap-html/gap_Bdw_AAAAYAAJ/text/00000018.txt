Jill PREFACE.

times, the fubftance of fpeeches in the Britifti

parliament, and other aflemblies, has often been

accurately collected, and carefully preferved;

and we may, therefore, reafonably fuppofe that

fpeeches in the Roman fenate, upon fubjects

in which the whole community were deeply

interefted, would be heard with equal attention,

and preferved with equal care.

A charge, of a very heavy nature, has been

brought againft our Author, which, were it well

founded, would utterly difqualify him from

writing a credible hiftory. He is accufed of

fuperftitious credulity. That he was of a fe-

rious and religious turn of mind, is fufficiently

apparent from many paflages in his Hiftory, in

which he feverely reprehends the licendoufnefs

and profligacy of the times he lived in, and ap­

plauds the fimplicity of conduct, and fanctity

of manners, of ancient times, when "that dif-

"regard of the gods, which prevails in the pre-

'' fent age, had not taken place; nor did every

"one, by his own interpretations, accommodate

"oaths and the laws to his particular views, but

"rather adapted his practice to them*." Again,

fpeaking of Spurius Papirius, he defcribes him

as a " youth, born in an age when that fort of

"learning which inculcates contempt of the gods

"was yet unknown^." Numberlefs paflages,

to this effect, might be cited; fuffice it, how­

ever, to obferve, that he omits no opportunity

of applauding good and pious actions, and of

reprehending, with ftrong indignation, the pro­

fane, the impious, and the immoral.
