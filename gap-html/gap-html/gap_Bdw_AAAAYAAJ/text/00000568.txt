THE HISTORY

LIII. " BUT the cafe itfelf compels us to leave a

city defolated by fire and ruin, and remove to

Veil, where every thing is entire, and not to

diftrefs the needy commons by building here.

"Now, I think, Romans, it muft be evident to

"yourfelves, though I fhould not fay a word on

'c the fubjett, that this is byt a pretext held out to

"ferve a purpofe, and not the real motive. For yc

'' remember, that this fcheme of our removing to

"Veii was agitated before the coming of the Gauls,

"^vhen the buildings, both public and private,

"were unhurt, and the city ftood in fafety. Now

'' obferve, tribunes, the difference between my

"way of thinking and yours. Ye are of opinion,

â€¢' that, even though it were not advifeable to be

"done at that time, yet it is plainly expedient now.

rc On the contrary, and be not furprifed at what I

"fay, until ye hear my reafons, even allowing that

"it had been advifeable to have removed at that

"time, when the whole city was in a ftate of

'c fafety, I would not vote for leaving thefe ruins

"now. Becaule at that time the caufe of our re-

"moving into a captured city would have been a

"victory obtained, a caufe glorious to us and our

"pofterity; fuch a removal, now, would be

"wretched and difhonourable to us, glorious to

"the Gauls. For we fhall appear not to have left

"our country in confequence of vicctory, but to

"have loft it by being vanquifhed; and, by the

"flight at the Allia, by the capture of the city,

"by the blockade of the Capitol, to have been laid

"under the neceffity of forfaking our dwellings,

"and betaking ourfelves to exile and flight, from a

"place which we were not able to defend. And

"have the Gauls been able to demoiim Rome, and'

"fhall the Romans be deemed unable to reftore it ^

"What remains, then, but that ye allow diem to

"come with new forces, for it is certain they have

"numbers fcarcely credible, and make it their
