x PREFACE.

and therefore they pronounce them to be viola­

tions of truth. That many of them were not

fpoken by the perfons to whom they are

afcribed, nor upon the occafions alleged, muft

a much more agreeable manner than he could

have interwoven them into his narrative, which

rians, it is true, have rejected this plan: but

Livy is not therefore reprehenfible, becaufe he

does not conform himfelf to their ideas of

himfelf to a cuftom which prevailed very ge­

nerally before his time, and which fucceeding

writers, of great tafte and judgment, have ap­

proved and adopted. The conduct of Livy,

in this refpect, if necefiary, might be juftified by

the example of Herodotus,Xenophon, Polybius,

Salluft,
