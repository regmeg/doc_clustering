the conful encamped outfide the Capuan gate j and,

after purifying the army, marched from thence to

. Antium, and fat down at a fmall diftance from the

city, and the poft occupied by the enemy j where

the Volfcians, not daring to rifk an engagement,

bccaufe the troops from the ./Equans had not yet

arrived, endeavoured to fcreen themfelves within

trenches, fo that they might not be compelled to

fight. Fabius, next day, forming his troops, not

in one body, compofed of his couasrymen and the

allies intermixed, but in three feparate bodies, con­

fifting of the three feveral nations, furrounded the

rampart of the enemy; he himfclf was in the centre,

with the Roman legions: he ordered all to look for

the fignals from thence, in order that the allies and

he might begin the action at the fame time, and alfo

retire together, if he mould found a retreat: in the

rear of each divifion, he alfo placed their own ca­

valry. Having thus furrounded the camp, he af-

faulted it in three different places, and preffing them

vigoroufly on every fide, beat down the Volfcians

from the rampart, who were unable to withftand his

force: then advancing within the fortifications, he

drove them before him, in confufion and difmay,

towards one fide, and at length compelled them to

abandon the camp. After which, the cavalry, who

could not eafily have pafied over the rampart, and

had hitherto ftood as fpectators of the fight, coming

up with them, as they fled in diibrder, in the open

plain, and making great havoc of their difmayed

troops, enjoyed a fhare in the honour of the victory.

The number of flain, both within the camp and on

the outfide of the fortifications, was great, but the

fpoil was much greater in proportion j for the ene­

my were fcarcely able to carry off their arms, and.

their army had been entirely deftroycd, if the wood*

had not covered them in their flight.
