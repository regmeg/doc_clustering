ftranger, whom they accufed as undeniably guilty of,

murder; and when he was informed of the fact, and

of the caufe of it, obferving the perfon and mien of

the hero, filled with more dignity and majefty than

belonged to a human being, he inquired who he

The Potitii, inftrutfted by Evander, were directors

of that foJemnity for many ages, until the folemn

office of the family was delegated to public fervants,

on which the whoJe race of the Potitii became ex-
