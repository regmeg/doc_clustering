56 THE HISTORY

if o o K Sabines, that prior to this, fome of their people

had fled into the Afylum, and were detained at

Rome. Thefe were the reafons afilgned for the

war. The Sabines, reflecting that a great part of

their original ftrength had been fixed at Rome by

Tatius, and that the Roman power had been allb

lately increafed, by the accefiion of the people of

Alba, took care, on their part, to look round for

foreign aid. Etruria lay in their neighbourhood,

and the ftate of the Etrurians neareft to them was

that of the Veientians. From among thefe they

procured a number of volunteers, who were in­

duced to take part againft the Romans, principally

by the refentment which they ftill retained on

account of their former quarrels. Several alfo of

the populace, who were indigent and unprovided

of a fettlement, were allured by pay. From the

government they received no afiiftance, and the

Veientians, for it was lefs furprifing in others, ad­

hered to the terms of the truce ftipulated with Ro­

mulus. Vigorous preparations being made on both

fides, and it being evident, that, whichever party

fhould firft commence hoftilities, would have con.

fiderably the advantage, Tullus feized the oppor­

tunity of making an jncurfion into the lands of the

Sabines. A furious battle enfued at the wood

Called Malitiofa, in which the Romans obtained

the vicctory; and, for this, they were indebted not

only to the firm ftrength of their infantry, but

chiefly to the cavalry, which had been lately aug­

mented. For, by a fudden charge of this body,

the ranks of the Sabines were thrown into fucli

diforder, that they were neither able to continue

the fight, nor to make good their retreat^ without

great flaughter,

XXXI. AFTg!?. the defeat of the Sabines, the

government of Tullus, and the Roman ftate in

general, pbffcffed a large degree of pow.er and of

fame.
