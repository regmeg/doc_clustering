OF ROME. 41

roans received Horatiys with triumphant congratu- B O O K

lacions, and a degree of joy proportioned to the

greatnefs of the danger that had threatened their

caufe. Both parties then applied themfelves to the

burying of their dead, with very different difpofitions

of mind; the one being elated with the acquifition

of empire, the other deprefied under a foreign ju-

rifdiction. The lepulchres ftill remain, in the feve-

ral fpots where the combatants fell; thofe of the

two Romans in one place nearer to Alba, thofe of

the three Albans, on the fide next to Rome; but,

in different places, as they fought.

XXVI. BEFORE the armies feparatcd, Mettius,

in conformity to the terms of the treaty, defired to

know from Tullus vvhat commands he would give,

.and was ordered to keep the young men in readi-

nefe, under arms, as he intended to employ them in

cafe of a war breaking out with the Veientians.

The two parties then retired to their refpective

homes. Horatius advanced at the head of the Ro­

mans, bearing in triumph the fpoils of the three

brothers: near the gate Capena he was met by his

fifter, a maiden who had been betrothed to one of

the Curiatii: obferving, on her brother's moulder,

the military robe of her lover, made by her own,

hands, me tore her hair, and, wiiji loud and mourn­

ful outcries, called on the name of her deceafed

fpoufe: his fifter's lamentations, in the midft of his

own triumph, and of fo great public joy, irritated

the fierce youth to fuch a degree, that, drawing his

fword, he plunged it into her breaft, at the fame time

upbraiding her, in thefe words, " Begone to thy

"fpoufe, with thy unfcafonable love, fince thou

". couldft forget what is due to the memory of thy

"deceafed brothers, to him who ftill furvives, and

"to thy native country: fo perifh every daughter

"of Rome that fhall mourn for its enemy." Both

the ftnate and geople were mocked at the horrid
