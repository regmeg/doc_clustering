* o o K The deliverer of the city was received in the camp  
^-\- . with joy, and the king's fons were driven thence

•with difgrace. Two of thefe followed their father,

and went into exile at Csere, among the Etrurians.

Sextus Tarquinius having retired to Gabii, as if to

his own dominions, was flain by forne perfons, who

were glad of an opportunity of gratifying old ani-

mofities, which he had excited there by his rapine

and murders. Lucius Tarquinius Superbus reigned

twenty-five years. The government of kings con­

tinued from the building of the city to the eftablifh-

ment of its liberty, two hundred and forty-foCr

years. After that, in an afiembly of the Centuries,

held by the Prefect of the city, were elected, con­

formably to a plan found in the commentaries of

Servius Tullius, two magiftratesi called Confuls.

quinius Collatinus.
