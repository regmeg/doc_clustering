rather than Numa, and would go abroad themfelves

.to war; therefore, left the facred rites, the per­

formance of which pertained to the office of the

Iking, mould be neglected, he created a flamen of

Jove, who was to attend conftantly on the duties of

that priefthood, and decorated him with a fplendid

<lrefs, and a royal curule chair. He created like-

of Vefta, an order of priefthood derived from Alba,

and therefore related, in fome fort, to the family of

the founder of the city. For thefe he fixed a fti-

pend, to be paid out of the public treafury, that

mour, called Ancilia, and to go in proceffion

through rhe city, finging hymns, with leaping and

tutions refpecting all the facred rites, together with

directions with what victims, on what days, in what

what funds thp expencesofthem mould be defrayed.

He alfo fubjected all other religious performances,

whether public or private, to the determination of

the pontiff; in order that there mould be a certain

perfon to whom the people might, on every occa-

fion, refort for directions, left, through their ne-

gins, and the falii, mentioned in this chapter, fee the fame learned

Roman hiftoriaiu, in general, and Liry, in particular.
