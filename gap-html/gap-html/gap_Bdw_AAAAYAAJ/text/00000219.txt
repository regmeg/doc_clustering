"Without doubt, if people would make the proper

"to make a declaration, and a fhew' of war. The

"fates and the gods would of themfelves accomplifh

"the reft." Such profpects as thefe had allured

the Etrurians to arm, notwithftanding all the vicifli-

tudes of fuccefs and defeat, which they had already

experienced.

XLV. THE Roman confuls themfelves had no

other dread than of the power, and the arms, of their

own countrymen: when they reflected on the very v

dangerous tendency of their mifbehaviour, in the laft

war, they were deterred from bringing themfelves

into a fituation, where they would have two armies

to fear, at the fame time: to avoid therefore being

expofed to this double danger, they kept the troops

confined within the camp, in hopes that delay, and

time itfelf, might perhaps fbften their refentment,

and bring them back to a right way of thinking,

This encouraged their enemies the Veientians and

Etrurians, to act with greater precipitation: at firft,

they endeavoured to provoke the foe to fight, by

riding up to the camp, and offering challenges; and,

at length, finding that this had no effect, by reviling

both the confuls themfelves, and the army; telling

them, that "the pretence of difienfions amorig

"themfelves, was an artifice contrived to cover

't their cowardice; that the confuls were more dif-

"fident of the courage of their troops, than of their

"difpofuion to obey orders: that was a ftrange kind

I' of fedition, which mewed itfcrf in filence, and
