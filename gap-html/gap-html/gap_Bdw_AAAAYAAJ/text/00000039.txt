OF ROME.

As to the relations which have been handed down of

events prior to the founding of the city, or to thofc

tranfactions that gave occafion to its being founded,

and which bear the femblance rather of poetic fic­

tions, than of authentic records of hiftory—thefe, I

have no intention either to maintain or refute. An­

tiquity is always indulged with the privilege of ren­

dering the origin of cities more venerable, by inter­

mixing divine with human agency: and if any nation

may claim the privilege of being allowed to confider

its original as facred, and to attribute it to the opera­

tions of the Gods, furely the Roman people, who

rank fo high in military fame, may well expect, that,

while they choofe to reprefent Mars as their own

parent, and that of their founder, the other nations

of the world may acquiefce in this, with the fame

deference with which they acknowledge their fove-

reignty. But what degree of attention or credit may

be given to thefe and fuch-like matters I mall not

confider as very material. To the following con-

fiderations, I wifh every one ferioufly and earneftly

to apply his thoughts; by what kind of men, and

by what fort of conduct, in peace and war, the em­

pire has been both acquired and extended: then, as

difcipline gradually declined, let him follow in his

thoughts the ftructure of antient morals, at firft, as

it were, leaning afide, then finking farther and far­

ther, then beginning to fall precipitate, until he ar­

rives at the prefent times, when our vices have at­

tained to fuch a height of enormity, that we can no

longer endure either the burden of them, or the

fharpnefs of the remedies neceffary to correct them.

This is the great advantage to be derived from the

ftudy of hiftory; indeed the only one which caa

make it anfwer any profitable and falutary purpofe:

for, being abundantly furnifhed with clear and dif-

tinct examples of every kind of conduct, we may

feledt for ourfelves, and for the ftate to which we be.­
