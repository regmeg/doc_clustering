unhurt; fo that, though, fingly, he was by no means

a match for them, all together, yet was he confident

of fucceis, againft each of them, feparately. In order

therefore to avoid their joint attack, he betook

himfelf to flight, judging that they would purfue

with fuch different degrees of fpeed, as their wounds

would allow. He had now fled to fome diftance

from the place where they had fought, when, look­

great diftance from him: againft him he turned

back, with great fury, and while the Alban army

called out to the Curiatii to fuccour their brother,

Horatius, having in the mean rime flain his anta-

third, who was at no great diftance, could come up

to the relief of his brother, he difpatched the fecond

Curiatius. And, now, they were brought to an equa­

lity, in point of number, only one on each fide

third conteft; the other, enfeebled by a wound,

fatigued with running, and difpirited, befides, by the

fete of his brethren, already flain, met the victori­

fight; the Roman, exulting, cried out, "Two of

"you have I offered to the fhades of my brothers,

"the third I will offer to the caufe in which we are

"engaged, that the Roman may rule over the Al-

"ban:" and, whilft the other could fcarcely fup-

port the weight of his armour, he plunged his

fword downward into his throat; then, as he lay

proftrate, he defpoiled him of his arms. .The Ro­
