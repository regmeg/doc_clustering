30° THE HISTORY

BOOK quainting them alfo that the affairs of the decemvirs

y^i' . at Rome were defperate; and fome, who came later,

Y.R. 305. faying, that Appius, having hardly efcaped with life,

$.(.'.447. was gone into exile: all this had fuch an effect on

the foldiery, that they cried out, To arms! fnatched

up the ftandards, and marched towards Rome. The

decemvirs, exceedingly alarmed, both by the tranf-

actions which they few, and by thofe which they

heard had pafied at Rome, ran to different parts of

the camp, in order to quell the commotion. While

they acted with mildnefs, they received no anfwer.

If any of them offered to exert authority, he was

anfwered, That they were men; and befides, had

arms. They proceeded in a body to the city, and

pofted themfelves on the Aventine, exhorting the

commons, whenever they met any of them, to re-

aflume their liberty, and create plebeian tribunes.

No other violent expreffion was heard. Spurius

Oppius held the meeting of the fenate, when it was

refolved, that no harfh meafures fhould be ufed,

becaufe they themfelves had given occafion .to the

infurrection. Three conlulars were fent as deputies,

Spurius Tarpeius, Caius Julius, and Servius Sulpi-

cius, to aflc, in the name of the fenate, by whofe

orders they had quitted their camp; or what was

their intention in pofting themfelves, in arms, on

the Aventine; in changing the direction of their

hoftile operations from the enemy, and fcizing, by

force, on their native country. The others were at

no lofs what to anlwer j but they were at a lofs for

a peifon to vgive the anfwer, having not yet ap­

pointed any particular leader, and individuals not

being very forward to take on themfelves the invi­

dious office. The multitude only called out toge­

ther, that they mould fend Lucius Valerius and

Marcus Horatius, and to them they would give

their anfwer.
