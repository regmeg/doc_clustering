OF ROME. 533.

"choice to dwell in this city, captured by them, BOOK

"and forfaken by you? What would you think, if, t _' j

"not the Gauls, but your old enemies the ,Equans Y.R. 365.

"or Volfcians, mould form the defign of removing B. c. 3*7.

"to Rome? Would ye be willing that they fhould

"become the Romans, and ye the Veientians? Or

"would ye choofe that this fhould be a defert in

"your pofieffion, rather than a city in that of the

"enemy? Any thing more impious I really can-

"not conceive. Is it out of averfion to the trouble

"of rebuilding, that ye are ready to incur fuch guile

•'' and fuch difgrace? Suppofing that there could

"not, in the whole city, be erected a better or

"more ample ftructure than that cottage of our

"founder, were it not more defirable to dwell in

"cottages, after the manner of fhepherds and ruf-

"ties, in the midft of your facred places and tu-

"telar deities, than to have the commonwealth go

"into exile? Our forefathers, a collection of

'' ftrangers and fhepherds, when there was nothing

"in thefe places but woods and marmes, built a

"new city in a very fhort time. Do we, though

"we have the Capitol and citadel fafe, and the

"temples of the gods ftanding, think it too trouble-

"fome to rebuild one that has been burned? And

"what each particular man would have done, if his

"houfe had been deftroyed by fire, do the whole

"body of us refufe to do the fame, in the cafe of ^

"general conflagration?

LIV. "LET me afk you, if, through fome ill de-

"fign or accident, a fire mould break out at Veii,

"and the flames being fpread by the wind, as might

"be the cafe, mould confume a great part of tlie •

"city: muft \ve feek Fidenae, or Gab'ii, or fome

"other city, for us to remove t6 ?'; Has 6'or native

"foil fo flight a hold of bur affections; and this

*c earth, wh'ich we caH our mother? Of does our

"love.
