year, whc n the quiet of the ftate was undifturbed by

foreign vars, and the diflfenfions at home had been

healed, a more grievous calamity of another nature

fell upon it: at firft a fcarcity of provifions, occa-

fioned by the lands lying unfilled during the fecef-

fion of the commons* and afterwards, a famine, not

lefs fevere than what is fek in a befieged city; and

which would have increafed to fuch a degree that the

flaves, without doubt,'and allb many of the com足

mons, muft have perimed, had not the confuls taken

rheafures to remedy it, by fending to all quarters to

buy up corn; not only into Etruria on the coaft to

the right of Oftia, and through the Volfcians, along

the coaft on the left as far as Cumae, but even to

Sicily; for the hatred, entertained againft them by

their neighbours, compelled them thus to look for

aid to diftant countries. After a quantity of corn

had been purchafed at Cumae, the mips were de足

tained by the tyrant Ariftodemus, as the property of

the Tarquinii, whofe heir he was. Among the Vol足

fcians, and in the Pomptine diftrict, it could not

even be purchafed, the perfons employed in that

bufinefs being in danger of their lives from the vio足

lence of the inhabitants. From Etruria, fome corn

.was conveyed by the Tiber, by which the people

were fupported. At this unfeafonable time, while

thus diftreffed by the fcarcity, they were in danger

of heing farther haraffed by war, had not a moft

.deltructive peftilence attacked the Volfcians, when

they were juft ready to commence hoftilities. By

this dreadful calamity the enemy were fo difpirited,
