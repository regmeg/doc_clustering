"military tribunes aflumed tha't degree of kingly

"power over the commons of Rome. What

'* would have been the behaviour of thofe men, in

"the office of conful or dictator, who have exhi-

"bited a piclure of proconfular power in colours of

"fuch harfhnefs and cruelty? But this was no worfe

"than what the people deferved. Among eight

"military tribunes, they did not give room to one

"plebeian. Till of late, the patricians ufed to find

"the utmoft. difficulty, in filling up three places;

"but, now, they march in files, eight deep, to take

"pofieffion of the pofts of government j and even

"in fuch a crowd, no plebeian is found intermixed,

"who, if he lerved no other purpofe, might remind

"his colleagues, that the army was compofed aot of

"flaves but of freemen; of citizens who ought to

"be brought home, at leaft in winter, to their ha-

"bitations, and the comfort of their own roofs, and

"allowed, at fome time of the year, to vifit their

"parents, children, and wives; to exercife the rights

"of freemen, and to fhare in the election of ma-

"giftrares." While they exclaimed in thefe, and

luch like terms, they were not unequally matched in

an opponent, Appius Claudius, who had been left

at home, by his colleagues, for the purpolc of re-

prefling the turbulent fchemes of the tribunes; a

man trained, from his youth, in contentions with

the plebeians; who, fome years before, had recom­

mended, as has been mentioned, the difuniting the

power of the tribunes by the protefh of their col­

leagues.
