ji THE HISTORY

B o 6 It XXVHl. WHEN all was over, the Alban troops

^ -'-_• who had been fpectators of the engagement, march­

ed down into the plain, and Mettius congratulated

Tullus on his victory over the enemy. Tullus an-

fwered him, without mewing any fign of difplea-

fure, and gave orders that the Albans fhduld, with

the favour of fortune, join their camp wlth that of

the Romans, and appointed a facrifke of purifica­

tion to be performed next day. As foon as it was

light, all things being prepared in the ufual manner,

he commanded both armies to be fummoned to an

"immortal gods, and, next, to your own valour, it

"was the battle of yefterday: for ye had to ftrug-

"gle not only with your enemies, but, what is a

"more difficult and dangerous ftruggle, with the

"treachery and perfidy of your allies: for I will

'* now undeceive you; it was not by my order that

"the Albans withdrew to the mountains, nor was

•" what ye heard me fay, the iffuing of orders, but

"a ftratagem, and a pretext of having given orders,

"to the end that while ye were kept in ignorance

"of your being delerted, your attention might not

"be drawn away from the fight; and, that, at the

. "fame time, the enemy, believing themfelves to be

"furrounded on the rear, might be ftruck with ter-

"ror and difmay: but the guilt which I am expofing

'' to you, extends not to all the Albans: they fol-
