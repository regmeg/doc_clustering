4* THE HISTORY

o o K arifing from it, led out his troops into the field,. the

, Albans likewife marched out to meet him. When

both parties were drawn up in order of battle, the

leaders, attended by a few of the principal officers,

advanced into the middle fps.cc, where the Alban

began thus: "I urukrftood, from our king Clu-

*' ilius, that, on our part, injuries fuftained, and a re-  
"fufal of fatisfadlon, when demanded, were the

'" caufes of the prelent war j and I doubt not that

"you, Tullus, allege, op your part, the lame grounds

"of quarrel: but if, inftead of plaufible profcffions,

"what a formidable power the Etrurians pofiefs,

"both in our neighbourhood and more efpecially in

"yours, you, as being nearer to them, know bet-

"exhaufted. Wherefore, fince we are not content

"with the certain enjoyment of liberty, but are go-

"ing to hazard an uncertain caft for dominion or

"fhvery, let us, in the name of the gods, purfue

This propofal was not unpleafmg to Tullus, though,

both from his natural difpofuion, and from confidence
