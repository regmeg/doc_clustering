418 THE HISTORY

BOOK the three plebeians, Quintus Silius, Publius

,-^^_. TElius, and Publius Pupius were preferred before

Y.R. 346 Jyoung men of the moft illuftrious families. That

B. C.406* the people exerted this freedom, in giving their fuf-

frages,' was owing, I find, to the Icilii, out of which

family, the moft hoftile of any to the patricians, three

were appointed tribunes for that year; who, after

flattering the people with the profpectof a multitude

of various and great defigns to be archieved, and

thereby exciting their moft ardent wifhes, affirmed

that they would not ftir a ftep, unlefs the people

would, at leaft in the election of qusftors, the only

one which the fenate had left open to both patrici­

ans and plebeians, fhew a proper degree of fpirit

for the accomplifhtnent of what they wifhed for fo

long, and what the laws had put in their power.

The commons, therefore, confidered this as an im­

portant victory, and eftimated the quaeftorfhip in its

prefent ftate, not acccording to the intrinfic value of

the office itfelf, but as it appeared to lay open to new

men an accefs to the conlulfhip and the honours of a

triumph. On the other hand, the patricians ex-

pitied great indignation, at the profpect of the

pofts of honour not being fhared with others, but loft

to themfclves, affirming, that " if things were to re-

"main in that ftate, it would be folly to educate

"children, who, being excluded from the ftation of

"their anceftors, andxfceing others in pofieflion of

"their rightful honours, would be left without com-

"mand or power in the ftations of Salii or Flamens,

"with no other employment than that of offering

"facrifices for the people." The minds of both

parties being highly irritatcd, while the commons

aflumed new courage, and had alfo acquired three

leaders of the popular caufea of moft diftinguifhed

reputation, the fenate, feeing that every election

wherein the commons had liberty of choofing out of

both parties, would prove in the iflue like that of

the quaeftors, were earneft for the election of con­
