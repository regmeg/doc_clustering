THE HISTORY

if I could, would I venture to pronounce an opi­

nion; for I am aware that the matter is both remote

in antiquity, and has been already treated by many

others j the lateft writers always fuppofing them-

felves capable, either of throwing fome new light on

the fubject, or, by the fuperiority of their talents

for composition, of excelling the more inelegant

writers who preceded them. However that may

be, I mall, at all events, derive no fmall fatisfac-

tion from the reflection that my beft endeavours

nave been exerted in tranfmitting to pofterity the

atchievments of the greateft people in the world;

and if, amidft fuch a multitude of writers, my name

fbould not emerge from nbfcurity, I fhall confole

myfelf by confidering the diftinguimed reputation and

eminent merit of thofe who ftand in my way in the

purfuit of fame. It may be farther obferved, tha;

fuch a fubjecr. muft require a work of immenie ex­

tent, as our refearches muft be carried back through

a fpace of more than feven hundred years j that the

ftate has, from very fmall beginnings, gradually in-

crcafed to fuch a magnitude, that it is now diftreffed

by its own bulk; and befides, that there is every reafon

to apprehend that the generality or readers will receive

but little pleafure from the accounts of its firft origin,

or of the times immediately fucceeding, but will be

impatient to arrive at thefe modern times, in which

the powers of this overgrown ftate have been

long employed in working their own deftruction.

On the other hand, I fhall efteem this as fome

reward of my labour, that, fo long at leaf t as I fhall

luve my thoughts totally occupied in inveftigating

the tranfac~lions of fuch diftant times, without being

cmbarrafied by any of thofe unpleafing confidera-

tions, which, though they might not have power to

warp a writer's mind from the truth, would yet be

flifficient to create uneafinefs, I fhall withdraw my-

fe.lf from the light of the many evils to which our

cyes, in this age, have been fo long accuftomed.
