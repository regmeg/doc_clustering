the Romans who ftood neareft were aftonimed at * O O K

finding their flank left uncovered, by the departure of i

their allies, and, in a fhort time, a horfeman at full

fpeed brought an account to the king that the Al-

bans were retreating. Tullus, in this perilous junc­

ture, vowed to inftinite twelve new Salian priefts,

and alfo to build temples to Palenefs and Terror;

then, rebuking the horfeman with a loud voice, that

the enemy might hear, he ordered him to return to

the fight, telling him, that " there was no occafion

"for any uneafinefs; that it was by his order the

"Alban army was wheeling round, in order to fall

"upon the unprotected rear of the Fidenatians."

He commanded him alfo, to order the cavalry to

raife their fpears aloft; and, this being performed,

intercepted, from a great part of the infantry, the

view of the Alban army retreating: thofe who did

fee them, believing what the king had faid, fought

with the greater fpirit. The fright was now tranf-

ferred to the enemy, for they had heard what the

king had fpoken aloud, and many of the Fidenatians

underftood the Latine tongue, as having been inter­

mixed with Romans in the colony. Wherefore,

•dreading left the Albans might run down fuddenly

from the hills, and cut off their retreat to the town,

they betook themfelves to flight. Tullus prefied

them clofe, and after routing this wing compofed of

the Fidenatians, turned back with double fury

againft the Veientians, now difheartened by the dif-

may of the other wing. Neither could they with*

ftand his attack, and the river intercepting them be..

hind, prevented a precipitate flight. As foon as

they reached this, in their retreat, fome, fhamefully

. throwing away their arms, plunged defperately into

the water, and the reft, hefitating on the bank,

irrefolute whether to fight or fly, were overpowered

and cut off. Never before had the Romans been,

engaged in fo defperate an aftion.
