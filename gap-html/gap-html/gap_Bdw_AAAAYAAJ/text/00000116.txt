TH£ HISTORY

and it was commonly believed, that it had bee n built

by a general contribution from the feveral ftates of

Afia: Servius, in converfation with the chief men

of the Latines, with whom he had taken pains to

form connections of hofpitality and friendfhip, both

in his public and private capacity, ufed frequently,

in the ftrongeft terms, to recommend concord artd

a focial union between their feveral gods; and by

often repeating the fame fentimen's, prevailed fo far

at laft, that the Latine ftates agreed to build, in

conjunction with the Roman people, a temple to

Diana at Rome. This was an acknowledgment

that Rome was the fovereign head of both nations,

a point which had been fo often difputed in arms.

But though the Latines, finding all their efforts in

war ineffectual, fcemed now to have thrown afide

all concern with regard to that matter, yet ampng

the Sabines one particular perfon did not neglect an

opportunity, which feemed to be thrown in his way

by fortune, of recovering independence, by the exe­

cution of a fcheme which he planned himfelf. It is re­

lated, that a certain head of a family, among the Sa-

bines, had a heifer calf of wonderful fize and beauty

produced by one of his cows: her horns, which re­

mained for many ages fixed in the porch of the temple

of Diana, were a monument of this wonder. The

matter was confidered in the light of a prodigy, as

it defcrved, and the ibothfayers declared, that fove-

reignty would refide in that ftate whofe fubject mould

facrifice this heifer to Diana; and this prediction had

reached the ears of the prieft who had the charge of

Diana's temple. The Sabine, as foon as he had fixed

on a proper day for the facrifice, drove the heifer to

Rome, brought her to the te,tiple of Diana, and

placed her before the altar: the prieft, lufpecting

the truth, from the fize of the victim, of which he

had heard fo much, and remembering the predic­

tion, addrefles the Sabine thus; " Stranger, what

"are you preparing to do? To perform facrifice to

"Diana
