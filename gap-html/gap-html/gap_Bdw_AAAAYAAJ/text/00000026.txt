xx PREFACE.

brated characters which he holds up to our ad­

miration.

Polybius is allowed to be an author of con-

fummate judgment, indefatigable induftry, and

ftrict veracity. Livy himfelf admits that he is

entitled to entire credit. He takes extraordi­

nary pains to inveftigate the caufes of the fe-

cond Punic war, and to determine which of the

two nations had incurred the guilt of breach of

treaty. He difcufles th,e matter at confiderable

length*; ftating accurately, and carefully ex­

amining, the facts and arguments urged on

both fides; and, at length, brings the matter to

this iflue, that, if the war is to be conlidered as

taking its rile from the Heftruction of Sagun-

tum, the Carthaginians were in the wrong;

but by no means fo, if the matter be taken up

fomewhat higher, and the taking of Sardinia

by the Romans, and the impofmg a tribute

upon that ifland, be included in the account:

for that, then, the Carthaginians did no more

than take occafion to avenge an injury done

them.

Now, how ftands the account of this affair,

according to Livyf? From this difquifition of

Polybius, he carefully felects, and ftrongly

ftates, every thing which tends to favour the

caufe of the Romans; but pafles over in filence

every fact, and every argument, urged by the

Greek hiftorian in favour of the Carthaginians;

and thps he makes the worfe appear the better

caufe.
