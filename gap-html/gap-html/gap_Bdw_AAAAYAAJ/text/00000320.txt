BOOK many of the confulars exprefied their approbation.

B.C.447. the patricians to afiemble and appoint an interrex:

for the patting of any refolution, would be an ac­

knowledgment that the perfons, who convened the

fenate, were invefted with fome offices whereas the

member,who recommended that no refolution mould

pafs, meant thereby to declare them private citizens.

When the caufe of the decemvirs was thus finking

into ruin, Lucius Cornelius Maluginenfis, brother to

Marcus Cornelius the decemvir, having been pur-

pofely refcrved from among the confulars to clofc

the debate, under the pretence of anxiety about the

war, fupported his brother and his colleagues: "He

"wondered," he faid, " by what fatality it hap-

"pened, that thofe, who had been themfelves can-

"didates for the decemvirate, were the perfons

"who, either as fecondaries, or principals, waged

"this attack on the decemvirs j and why they

"fhould, now, at this particular time, when the

"enemy were juft at the gates, take fuch pains to

"fow clifTenfion among the citizens; whereas during

"fo many months, wherein the attention of the ftate

"had been difengaged, no one ever made it a mat-

"ter of difpute, whether thofe, who held the admi-

"niftration of the government, were legal ma-

'' giftrates, or not; unlefs it were becaufe they

"fuppofed, that, in a ftate of confufion, their con-

"dudt would not be fo eafily feen through. How-

'' ever, it was highly improper in any one to attempt

"to prejudge a caufe of that magnitude, while men's

"minds were occupied by more urgent concerns:

"it was his opinion, that the plea urged by Valeri-

"us and Horatius, that the office of decemvirs had

"expired on the ides of May, mould be taken into

", confederation, and difcufled by the fenate, when

"the wars with which they were then threatened

*' fhould be brought to a conclufion, and tranquil-

« lity
