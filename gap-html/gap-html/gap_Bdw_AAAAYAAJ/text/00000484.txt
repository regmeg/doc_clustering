B OvO K" fOrce Of a^ £'ie Greeks. At what a diftance from

i_ T' L^i " their homes! What tracts of land and fea lying

Y.R. 351." between! Yet, we grumble at the fatigue of a

B.C.400. " flege Qf one year's continuance, within lefs than

"twenty miles of us, alinoft within fight of our city;

"becaufe, 1 fuppole, the occafion of the war is
