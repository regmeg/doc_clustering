inhabitants flying to the city, that the Volfcians were . -,

at hand; this incident reprefied the fedition, when Y.R.

juft ripe, and on the point of breaking forth. The B.*-''

confuls were inftantly obliged by the fenate to lead

On the other fide, the enemy, without performing

any thing farther than alarming the Romans with

peril to which the carelefihefs of the conful hadex-
