per was adapted to conciliate the regard of the peo- Y.R.

ple, that he would find means to extricate the com- Bi£"

monwealth from the dreadful apprehenfions with

which it was befet: whereupon the conful, difmiff-

ing the fenate, went forth to the afiembly of the peo­

ple; there he aflured them, that the fenators were

folicitous that care mould be taken of the intereft of

the commons; but that their " fears for the fafety of

"the commonwealth, in general, had interrupted

"their deliberations, concerning that part of the

"ftate, which, though it muft be allowed to be the

"the enemy was juft at the gates, allow any bufi-

"nefs to take place of the neceflary provifions for

"the war; nor, even if they were allowed a little

"refpite, would it be either for the honour of the

"commons, to have refufed to take arms in defence

"of their country, unlefs on condition of firft re-

"to the good of their countrymen, through fear,

"or grandchildren." On the publication of this

edict, fuch debtors under arreft, as were prefent, in-

in every part of the city, rufliing out of their con­

finement, when the creditors had no longer a right

to detain them, ran together to the Forum, to take
