This circumftance alfo ftill farther, enhanced his BOOK

fame, that, together with him, perifhed all regular

and legal government. Mild and moderate as. his

adminiftration was, yet, becaufe the government was

lodged in the hands of a fingle perfon, fome au­

thors tell us, he intended to have refigned it, had not

the wickednefs of his family broken off the.defigns

which he meditated, for eftabliming the liberty of

XLIX. THUS began the reign of Lucius Tar- Y. R.'

quinius, who, from his fubfequent behaviour, got the g1^

prohibited the burial of his father-in-law, alleging

impofe fines, not only on thofe whom he fufpected

or difliked, but on perfons, with refpecl: to whornj

he could have no other view, than that of plunder.

Having, by thefe means, diminifhed the number

of the fenate, againft whom his proceedings were

chiefly levelled, he determined not to fill up the va­

cancies j hoping that the fmallnefs of their number

o would.
