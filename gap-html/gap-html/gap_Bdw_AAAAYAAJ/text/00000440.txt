404 THEHISTORY

O^ ^e*r P"vate connexions. The conful Fab'iHS,

the city being alarmed for its own fafety, held troops

pofted before the gates, when the horfemen, being

feen at a (jiftance, occafioned, at firlt, fome degree of

fright, while it was not known who they were: but,

this being prefently difcovered, people's fears were

converted into fuch tranfports of joy, that every part

of the city was filled with fhoming; every one con­

gratulating each other, on the return of the horfe­

men, fafe and victorious: then were feen, pouring

out in crowds into the ftreets from their houfes,

which a litfle before had been filled with lamenta­

the people towards the conful Sempronius, afforded

a fit opportunity for reviving the anger of the pub­

lic againft them: having therefore convened the

people, they exclaimed loudly, that the common­

wealth had been betrayed by its commanders at Veii;

and afterwards, in confequence of their efcaping with

impunity, the army was betrayed by the conful in

the country of the Volfcians, the cavalry, men of

diftinguifhed bravery, given up to flaughter, and the

camp Ihamefully delcrted. Then Caius Junius, one

of the tribunes, ordered Tempanius the horfernan to

be called, and in their prefence addrefled him thus:

"Sextus Tempanius, 1 demand of you, whether it

"is your opinion that the conful Caius Sempronius
