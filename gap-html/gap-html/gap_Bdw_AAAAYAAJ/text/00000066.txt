30 THE HISTORY

B o o K ftantly about I)is perfon, in time of peace as well

as war,

XVI. SUCH were his atchievements in hls mortal

ftate; after which, as he was holding an afiembly in

the plain, on the borders of the lake of Capra, for

the purpofe of reviewing his army, a fudden ftorm

arofe, accompanied with violent thunder and light­

ning; the king was enveloped in a thick cloud,

•which hid him from the eyes of the aflembly, and

was never more feen upon earth. The Roman

youth were at length eafed of their apprehenfions,

by the return of calm and ferene weather, after fuch

a turbulent day; but when they faw the royal feat

empty, though they readily believed the fepators,

who had ftood neareft to him, that he had been

carried up on high by the ftorm, yet they were

ftruck with tbch dread at being thus left in a manner

fatherlefs, that, for fome time^ they remained in

mournful filence. At laft, fome few letting the

example, the whole multitude falnted Romulus as

"a deity, the fon of a deity; the king and parent

"of the city of Rome;" and implored his favour,

with prayers, that he would be pleafed always

"propitioufly to watch over the fafcty of his own.

"offspring." Some, I believe, even at that time,

harboured filent fufpicions that the king had been

torn in pieces by the hands of the fenators. Such a

report was fpread abroad, but it was little credited,

both on account of the high admiration entertained of

the man, and becaufe the prefent confternation caufrd

the other account to be more generally received.

It is farther mentioned, that a contrivance of one

particular man procured additional credit to this re-

prefcntation of the matter; for Proculus Julius, a

g!n of the appellation, although it muft be admitted to be, by nq

means, certain, that they were not fo called, as fome allege, from

t.hc name of their captain, Celer; while others contend that they w're

fo culled fiom the Greek woitl x.i*.\,, which lignifies a hoilan.i i.
