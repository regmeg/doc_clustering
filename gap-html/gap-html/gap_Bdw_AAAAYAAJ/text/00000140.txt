THE HISTORY

o o K tncr quickly, in aftonifhment, as may be fuppofed, at

a deed fo atrocious, and unheard-of. Every one

exclaimed with vehemence againft the villany and

violence of the prince: they were deeply affected by

the grief of her father, and alfo by the difcourfe of

Brutus, who rebuked their tears, and ineffectual
