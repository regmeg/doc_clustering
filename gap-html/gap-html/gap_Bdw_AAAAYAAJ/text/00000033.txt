PREFACE. xxvii

The Tranflator had intended a much more

copious commentary, than that which now ac­

companies this work; and, in that view, he

had prepared feveral diflertations upon the

manners and cuftoms of the Romans; their

fenate; their laws; their religious rites; their

arts of war, navigation, and commerce, &c.

But he acknowledges, with much pleafure',

that he has fmce found his labour, upon thofc

fubjedrs, rendered unneceflary by the publica­

tion of Dr. Adams Roman Antiquities; a work

fo excellent in its kind, that whoever has the

inftruction of youth committed to his care, "*•

will do them injuftice, if he omits to recom­

mend it to their perufal. The notes, therefore,

which are added, and which the Tranflator now

thinks it his duty to make as few, and as fhort

as poflible, are fuch only as were deemed more

immediately neceflary to render fome paffages

intelligible to the mere Englifh reader.

It hath been an ufual practice, in Prefaces to

works of this kind, for the Authors of them to

load the labours of their predeceffors with

abufe: a pradice, of which the prefent Tranf-

iu tor acknowledges he neither fees the neceflity,

nor the utility. For, mould he fucceed in dif-

paraging the works of others, in the humble;

walk of tranflation; mould he be able to prove

their works ever fo wretchedly executed, it

will by no means follow from thence, that his

is better. That he thinks it is, is clear from

his prefuming to publifh it. But, as the public

has an undoubted right to judge for itfelf, and

will moft afluredly exercife that right, the fuc-

cefs of every work, of whatever kind, muft

ultimately depend upon its own merit.
