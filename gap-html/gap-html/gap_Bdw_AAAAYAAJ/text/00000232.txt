TrtE HISTORY

future. Aulus Virginius and Spurius Servilius were

next elected confuls. After the lofs fuftained in the

laft battle, the Veientians avoided coming again to

B.C.474. an engagement. They employed themfelves in

committing depredations, and fending out parties

from the Janiculum, which ferved them as a for-

trefs; fcoured every part of the Roman territories,

fo that neither the cattle, nor the hufbandmen, could

any where remain in fafety. At laf t they were en­

trapped by the fame ftratagem, by which they had

circumvented the Fabii: purfuing fome cattle, which

had been purpofcly thrown in their way, as a temp­

tation, they fell into an ambufcade. In proportion

as their numbers were greater, fo was the flaughter.

The violent rage, which this overthrow excited,

gave caufe and beginning to one much greater: for,

having crofied the Tiber by night, they made an af-

fault on the camp of the conful Servilius; and, be­

ing repulfed with great lofs, with difficulty effected

a retreat to the Janiculum. The conful immediate­

ly palTed the Tiber from his fide, and fortified a

camp at the foot of the Janiculum. Next day, as

foon as light appeared, partly led by the confidence,

infpired by his fuccefs in the fight of the day before,

but chiefly becaufe the fcarcity of corn made it ex­

pedient to adopt even dangerous meafures, provided

they were expeditious, he rafhly marched up his

troops, againft the fteep of the Janiculum, to the

camp of the. enemy: there he met with a repulfe,

more fhameful than that which he had given them

the preceding ttay; and both he, and his army, owed

their prefervation from deftruction to the timely in­

tervention of his colleague. The Etrurians, now in-

clofed between the two armies, to one or other ot

which their rear was by turns expofed,were entirely

cut off. Thus, through a fortunate act of temerity,

the Veientians were effectually overpowered, and the

war brought to a conclufion.
