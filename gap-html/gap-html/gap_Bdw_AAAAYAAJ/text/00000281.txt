and fenate in a lefs formidable Kght, yet they ftill

dreaded left, befides the purpofes which were de­

clared, this might be a fcheme of the Veientians or

the Sabines; and left the powerful enemy already

within the city might, in confequence of a concerted

plan, be fupported prefently by the Sabine and
