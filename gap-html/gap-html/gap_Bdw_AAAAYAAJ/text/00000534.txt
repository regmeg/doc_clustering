BOOK territories, until the Volfinians, becoming weary of

t_X'..,_. tne war, had a truce for twenty years granted them,

Y.R. 364. on condition that they fhould make reftitution to the

B.C. j«8. Roman people, and furnifh the pay of the army for

that year. During this year, Marcus Caedicius, a

plebeian, gave information to the tribunes, that

"in the new ftreet, where the chapel now ftands,

"above the temple of Vefta, he had heard in the dead

"of the night, a voice louder than that of a man,

"ordering notice to be given to the magiftrates,

"that the Gauls were approaching." This intelli­

gence, on account of the mean condition of the au­

thor, as frequently happens, was disregarded; and

alfo,becaufe that nation, lying at a great diftance,was

therefore very little known. And they not only

flighted the warnings of the gods, at this crifis of

impending fate, but the only human aid which could

have availed them, Marcus Furius, they drove away

to a diftance from the city: for, having been cited

by Apuleius, a plebeian tribune, to anfwer a charge

concerning the plunder of Veii, and having about the

fame time fuffered the lofs of a fon, who had almoft

arrived at the years of manhood, he called together

to his houfe the members of his tribe and depend­

ents, who compofed a great part of the commons,

and afked their fentiments on the occafion; when

being told, in anfwer, that they would make up by a

contribution whatever fine he fhould be condemned

to pay, but to effecT: his acquittal was out of their

power, he went into exile, after praying to the im­

mortal gods, that if he was undeferving of fuch inju­

rious treatment, they would fpeedily give that un­

grateful ftate. reafon to regret his abfence. On his

not appearing, he was fined fifteen thoufand afes

in weight*.
