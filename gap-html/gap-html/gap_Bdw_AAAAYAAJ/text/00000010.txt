hiftory; parts of which, as they were finiflied,

he read to Auguftus and Mecaenas.

rinifhed his work, comprifing, in an hundred

and forty-two books, the hiftory of Rome,

from the foundation of that city to the death

of Drufus, containing a period of feven hun­

dred and forty-three years, ending nine years

before the birth of our Saviour. Having com­

pleted this great work, he returned to fpend the

remainder of his days in his native country,

where he died, A. D. 17, at the age of feventy-

daughter, married to Lucius Magius, an orator,

who is advantageoufly fpoken of by Seneca.
