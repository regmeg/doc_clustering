BOOK and attendants fled immediately. He himfelf, being

L defperately hurt, with his royal retinue, who were

terrified almoft to death, attempted to retire to his

houfe, and had arrived at the head of the Cyprian

ftreet, when he was flain by fome, who had been

fent thither for that purpofe, by Tarquinius, and

had overtaken him in his flight. It is believed,

other inftances of her wickednefs rendering it cre­

dible, that this was done by the advice of Tullia.

It is certain, for there is fufficient proof of the fact,

that fhe drove into the Forum in her chariot; and,

without being abafhed at fuch a multitude of men,

called out her hufband from the fenate.houfe, and

was the firft who faluted him king. She was then

ordered by him, to withdraw from fuch a tumult;

and when, in her return home, fhe arrived at the

head of the Cyprian ftreet, where the enclofure of

Diana lately ftood, as the chariot turned to the

right towards the Virbian hill, in order to drive up

to the Efquilian mount, the perfon who drove the

horfes, ftruck with horror, ftopped and drew in

the reins, and fhewed his miftrefs the murdered

Servius lying on the ground. The barbarity of

her behaviour on this occafion, is reprefented as in­

human and fhocking; and the place bears teftimo-

ny to it, being thence called the wicked ftreet,

where Tullia, divefted of all feeling, agitated by

the Furies, the avengers of her fifter and hufband,

is laid to have driven her chariot over her father's

corpfe, and to have carried on her bloody vehicle,

part of the body and the blood of her father, with

which flie herfelf was alfo fprinkled and ftained, to

the houfehold gods of her and her hufband's family,

through whofe refentment followed, fhortly after, a

train of events fuited to the iniquitous commence­

ment of this reign. Servius Tullius reigned forty-

four years, during which his conduct was fuch, that

even a good and moderate fuccefibr would have

found it difficult to lupport a competition with him.
