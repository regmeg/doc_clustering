^ THE HISTORY, &c.

BOOK caufe, before the city was taken, all the public ftores

. -^L^ of corn had been conveyed thither j fo that the Ro-

Y R. 351. mans would have grown weary of the attempt, and

B. C.40I. ^etired, had not the fortrefs been betrayed to them

by a flave. He gave admittance, through a place

of difficult accefs, to fome foldiers, who made them-

felvts mafters of it; and while they were employed-

in killing the guards, the reft of the multitude, lofing

all courage at the fight of this unexpected danger,

laid down their arms. After demolifhing both the

citadel and city of Artena, the legions were led back-

from the country of the Volfcians, and the whole

power of Rome turned againft Veil. The traitor

received as a reward, befides his liberty, the proÂ­

perty of .two families, and was called Servius Ro-

jnanus. Some are of opinion, that Artena belonged

to the Veientians, not to the Volfcians: a miftake

occafioned by there having been once a town of that

name, between Caere and Veii. But that town the

Roman kings demolifhed; it was the property of the

Caeritians, not of the Veientians; this other of the

fame name, the defirution of which we have related,

vas in the country of the Volfcians.
