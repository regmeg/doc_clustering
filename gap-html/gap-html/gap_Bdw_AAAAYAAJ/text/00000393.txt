OF ROME.

Jation round the enemy's walls. An account of this

being conveyed to Rome, Marcus Geganjus, conful,

inftantly fee out with an army, chofe ground, for his Y.R.

camp, at the diftance of three miles from the enemy; B. c. 44°'

and, as the day was now far fpent, ordered his men

to refrefh themfelves: then, at the fourth watch,

he put his troops in motion: they- were foon fet to

work, and made fuch expedition, that at fun-rife

the Volfcians faw themfelves inclofed by the Ro­

mans, with ftronger works, than thofe with which

they had furrounded the city. The conful had alfo,

on one fide, drawn a line acrofs, to the wall of Ar-

dca, to open a communication with his friends in the

city.

X. THE general of the Volfcians, who had hi­

therto maintained his troops, not out of magazines

provided for the purpofe, but by corn, brought in

daily from the plunder of the country, finding him-

felf cut off at once from every refource, by being

fliut up within the enemy's lines, requefted a confer­

ence with the conful, and told him, that" if the in-

"tention of the Romans in coming thither was to

"raife the fiege, he was willing to withdraw the

"troops of the Volfcians from the place." To this

the conful anfwered, that " it was the part of the

'.' vanquifhed to receive terms, not to dictate them;

'( apd that the Volfcians (hould not have the making

"of thejr own terms, for their departure, as they

'C had for phejr coming to attack the allies of the

"Roman people." lie infifted, that " they fhould

"deliver up their general into his hands, lay

"down their arms, and acknowledging themfelves

"vanquifhed, fubmit po his farther orders;" de­

claring, that " if thefe terms were not complied

"with, whether they rerqained there, or retired, he

"would proceed againft them as a determined ene-

"my j and would be better pleafed to carry home a

'( victory over the Yolfcians, $han an infidjous ^

A A 3 '' peace."
