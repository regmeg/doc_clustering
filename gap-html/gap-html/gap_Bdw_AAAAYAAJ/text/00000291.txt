OF ROME.

"myfelf to be declared conful, in contradiction to

"the decree of the fenate. And you, Caius Clau-

"dius, I exhort, that you, on your part, reftrain Y.R. i94.

"the Roman people from this licentioufnefs; and B.c.4s».

"be perfuaded, that, on my part, I fhall regard your

"conduct therein in fuch a light, that I mall not

"confider you as obftructiing my attainment of ho-

"nour, but as augmenting the glory of my refufalj

"and protecting me againft the ignominy which I

"fhould incur, by being re-ele&ed." They then

iflued their joint orders, that " no perfon mould vote

"for Lucius Quintius being conful; and, that, if any

"one did, they would not allow fuch vote."

XXII. THE confuls elected were Quintus Fabius Y. R.i95.

Vibulanus a third time, and Lucius Cornelius Ma- B. C. *57'

luginenfis. The general furvey was performed that

year. The luftrum could not be clofed, confiftently

with the rules of religion, on account of the Capitol

having been taken and the conful flain. In the be­

ginning of the year, in which Quintus Fabius and

Lucius Cornelius were confuls, various difturbances

arofe. The tribunes excited commotions among the

commons. The Latines and Hernicians gave in­

formation of a formidable war being commenced by

the Volfcians and JEquans; that the legions of the

Volfcians were at Antiumj and that there were

ftrong apprehenfions of that colony itfelf revolting.

With difficulty the tribunes were prevailed on to

allow the bufinefs of the war to be firft attended to.

The confuls then divided the provinces between

them: Fabius was appointed to march the legions

to Antium, Cornelius to remain at Rome, for the

protection of the city, in cafe any party of the ene­

my, as was the practice of the .flSquans, mould come

to make depredations. The Hernicians and Latines

were ordered to fupply a number of men in con­

formity to the treaties; and of the army, two parts

were compofed of the allies, the third confifted of

• natives.
