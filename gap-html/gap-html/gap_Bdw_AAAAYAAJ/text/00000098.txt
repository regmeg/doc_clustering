B o o K of jf, when left without inhabitants; and this induced

^^j the Romans to demolifh that city, that it might not

always ferve for a receptacle to the enemy. At

length, the whole force of the Latine war was col­

lected about Medullia, and the conteft was carried

on there with various fuccefs: for the city was not

only well defended by works, and fecured by a

ftrong garriTon, but the army of the Latines, having

pitched their camp in the open country, fought the

which the vicious.aflumed from hence, and which

gained ground continually, a prifon was built in the

middle of the city, adjoining the Forum: and not

only the city, but the territory alfo and boundaries

of the ftate were extended by this king. The Mae-

Roman dominion extended as far as the fea, and the
