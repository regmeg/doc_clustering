places convenient for the purpofe, they could not BOOK

deter the feveral plebeians from attending {he meet- . i' '_j

ings and cabals, and thereby put a Hop to farther V.R. 261,

proceedings. Afterwards, they all came forth in a B'C'489'

body, addrefiing the commons with intreaties and

fupplications; one would have thought that every

one of the patricians was going to fland his trial:

they befought them, if they did not think proper to

acquit him as innocent, yet confidering him as guil­

ty, to grant as a favour, on their requeft, the pardon

of one citizen, one fenator. However, as he himfelf

did not appear on the day appointed, they perfifted

in their refentment. He was condemned in his ab-

fence, and went into exile to the Volfcians, uttering

menaces againft his country, and breathing already

the refentment of an enemy. The Volfcians re­

ceived him kindly on his arrival, and daily increafed

their attention and refpect, in proportion as they had

opportunities of obterving the violence of his anger

againft his countrymen, and often heard him utter

complaints, *nd even threats againft them. He

lodged in the houfe of Attius Tullius, who was then

the man of the greateft confequence, by far, of any

among the Volfcians, and an inveterate enemy to the

Romans: and the one, being ftimulated by an old

animofity, the other, by frefh refentment, they be­

gan to concert fchemes for bringing about a war

•with Rome: they judged that it would be a difficult

matter to prevail on their people to take arms,

which they had fo often tried with ill fuccefs; that

by the many wars which they had fuftaincd at differ­

ent times, and lately by the lofs of their young men

in the peftilence, their fpirits were broken; and that

it was neceflary to make ufe of art, in order that

their hatred, which had now loft its keennefs through

length of time, might be whetted anew by fome

freih caule of relentment.
