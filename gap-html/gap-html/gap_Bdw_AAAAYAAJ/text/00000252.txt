21(5 THE HISTORY, &e.

BOOK the conful hefitated, between the confidence which

^^^-^^he knew he might place in the valour of his men,

Y.R. a86. and the difficulty of the ground, all cried out, with

B. c. 466. one voicC, that they would proceed; and they in-

ftantly put their words in execution; fticking their

fpears in the ground, that they might be lighter to

climb the fteeps, they ran forward in full fpeed.

The Volfcians having at the firft onfet difcharged

their miffive weapons, began to pour down on them,

as they approached, the ftones which lay among their

feet, and by inceflant blows from the higher ground,

ving was by this means almoft overborne; when

the conful, juft as they were beginning to give way,

reproaching them with their ramnefs, and at the

fame time with want of ipirit, made their fears give.

place to fhame. At firft, they ftood their ground

with determined firmnefs; then, as they recovered

ltrength to renew the attack, in fpite of the difad-

vantage of fituation, they ventured to advance, and

raifing the mout anew, moved forward 'in a body.

"Then, rufhing on again in full career, they forced

their way, and got over the difficult part of the

ground; when they had reached almoft to the fum-

mit of the hill, the enemy turned their backs, and

fpeed, both rufhed into the camp together, almoii

in one body. In this confirmation the camp was

taken. Such of the Volfcians as could make their

Roman army marched; and, after a fiege of a few

days, the town furrendered, not becaufc the force of

the befiegers was ftronger now than in the formt.r

fiege, but becaufe the fpirits of the befieged were

broken by the late unfuccefsful battle, and the lofs

of their camp.
