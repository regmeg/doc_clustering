they not only checked the Sabine legions, who were

vigoroufly prefling the troops which gave way, but

quickly put them to the rout. The Sabines fled

precipitately toward the mountains, which but few

of them reached. The greateft part, as has been

mentioned, were driven by the cavalry into the

river. Tarquinius, judging it proper to purfue

the enemy clofely, before they mould recover from

their difmay, as foon as he had fent off the booty

and prifoners to Rome, and burned the fpoils of the

enemy, collected together in a great heap, accord­

ing to a vow which he had made to Vulcan, pro.*

ceeded to lead his army forward into the Sabine

territories. On the other hand, the Sabines, though

they had met with a defeat, and had no reafon to

hope that they mould be able to retrieve it, yet, their

circumftances not allowing time for deliberation, ad­

vanced to meet him, with fuch troops as they had

haftily levied; and being routed a fecond time, and

reduced almoft to ruin, they fued for peace.

XXXVIII. COLLATIA, and all the land around

that city, was taken from the Sabines, and Egerius,

fon to the king's brother, was left there with a gar-

rifon. This was the manner, as I underftand, in

which the people of Collatia came under the do»

minion of the Romans, and this was the form of the

furrender. The king afked, "Are ye ambafladors

"and deputies on behalf of the people of Collatia,

"to furrender yourfelves, and the people of Colla-

*' tia?" "We are.'W Are the people of Colla-  
"tia in their own difpofal?" "They are."—" Do

"ye furrender yourfelves and the people of Collatia,

'i together with your city, lands, waters, boundaries,

'c temples, utenfils, all property both facred and

"common, under my dominion, and that of the

<' Roman people?" "We do furrender them."—-

« Well, I receive them." The Sabine war being

{hus concluded, Tarquinius returned in triumph to

F 3 Rome.
