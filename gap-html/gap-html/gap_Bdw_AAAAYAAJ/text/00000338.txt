Y.R. 305. There, in conjunction with the other army, they

B. C. 447. gave directions to the twenty tribunes of the foldiers

to choofe two out of their number, who were to hold

the command in chief: they chofe Marcus Oppius

and Sextus Manilius. The fenate were alarmed for.

the general fafety, but though they fat every day,

they fpent more time in wrangling than in delibera足

tion: the decemvirs were upbraided with the mur足

der of Siccius, the luft of Appius, and the difgraces

which they had incurred in war. It was refolved,

that Valerius and Horatius mould go to the Aven足

tine: but they refufed to go, on any other terms

than thole of the decemvirs refigning the badges of

that office, their title to which had expired a year

before. The decemvirs, remonftrating againft the

Jeverity of degrading them to the common level,

declared that they would not refign their authority,

until the purpofe of their election mould be fulfilled,

by the ratiffcation of the laws.

LIT. THE commons, on being informed by Mar足

cus Duilius, who had been plebeian tribune, that

the time was fpent in continual difputes, and no

bufinefs done, removed from the Aventine to the

facred mount: for Duilius had aflured them, that

"the fenate would never attend ferioufiy to the bufi-

"nefs, until they faw the city deferted; that the

"facred mount would remind them of the firmnefs

"of the commons, and that they would then dif-

"cover, that the re-eftablifhment of concord was

"impracticable, without the reftoration of the tri-

"bunitian office." Marching along the Nomentan

road, then called the Ficulr.ean, they encamped on

the facred mount, imitating the moderation of their

fathers, in refraining from every act of violence.

The army was followed by the commons, not one,

whofe age would permit him, refufing to go. Their
