XXIX. As no determination had yet been made,

with refpect to the plans introduced by the plebeian

tribunes, the commons on the one hand, laboured to

continue in office fuch of them as had promoted the

pafiing of the law, and the patricians on the other,

to procure the re-election of thofe who had proteft-

cd againft it. But the commons had the fuperior

influence in the election of their own magiftratcs:

for which difappointment the patricians revenged

themfelves by pafilng a decree of fenate, that con-

fuls, magiftrates ever odious to the commons, mould

be elected. Thus, after an interval of fifteen years, Y.R. 3<±,

confuls were again appointed, Lucius Lucretius Fla- Y.R.

vus, and Servius Sulpicius Camerinus. In the be­

ginning of this year, while the plebeian tribunes,

uniting their efforts, preffed the pafllng of their law

with great confidence, becaufe there was not any of

their body who would proteft againft it, and the con­

fuls for that very reafon were no lefs active in op-

pofing it, the whole attention of the public being

taken up with this bufincfs, the ^Equans made them­

felves mafters of Vitellia, a Roman colony in their

territory. The greateft part of the colonifts efcaped

with fafety to Rome; for the town being betrayed to

the enemy in the night, there was nothing to hinder

their flight from the contrary fide of the.city. That

province fell to the lot of the conful Lucius Lucretius.

He marched thither with an army, defeated the ene­

my in the field, and returned to Rome, where he was

to encounter a conteft of much greater difficulty.
