ginius and Largius were confidered as tending to

eftablifh a bad precedent; particularly that of Lar­

gius, which was utterly fubverfive of all credit.

The advice of Virginius was deemed to be the

fartheft from excefs, on either fide, and a juft medi­

um between the other two. But, through the fpirit

of faction, and men's regard to their private inte-
