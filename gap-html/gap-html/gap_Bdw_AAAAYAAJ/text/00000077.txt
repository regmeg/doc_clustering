OF ROME, 41

war, as it was to be waged, in fome manner, be- B O ° K

tween parents and their children, both parties de­

riving their defcent frpm Troy: for Lavinium owed

its origin to Troy, from Lavinium fprung Alba,

and, from the race of the Alban kings, the Romans

were defcended. The ifliie of the war, however,

was fuch as rendered the difpute lefs grievous than

might have been apprehended j for, without a gene­

ral engagement, and without any farther damage,

than the demolition of the houfes of one of the

cities, the two ftates were incorporated into one.

The Albans firft, with very numerous forces, made

an irruption into the Roman territories; and, at the

diftance of no more than five miles from the city,

fortified their camp with a trench, which, from the

name of their leader, was afterwards called the Clu-

jlian Trench, and retained the name for feveral ages,

until the occafion being in time forgotten, the name

too fell into difufe. In this camp, Cluilius the Al­

ban king died, on which the Albans created Met-

tius Fuftctius their dictator. Tullus, now, impatient

foraction, efpecially after the death of the king, af-

fured his men that the fupreme power of the gods,

winch had already begun with the head, would in­

flict:, upon the whole body of the Albans, the pe­

nalty incurred by their having occafioned this im­

pious war; and, marching paf t the enemy's camp

in the night, he advanced, with his army ready for

action, into the Alban territories. This procedure

drew out Mettius from the camp where he lay:

he led his troops, by the fhorteft road, towards the

enemy, fending forward an ambaflador to tell Tul­

lus, that " it was highly expedient that they mould

"confer together, before they came to an engage-

"ment; that, if he would give him a meeting, he

'' was confident that what he had to propofe to his

'•' confederation would appear to concern the intereft

"of Rome, no lefs than that of Alba." Tullus, not

thmking^it proper to decline the propofal,. though

he fa\v no probability of any good confequence
