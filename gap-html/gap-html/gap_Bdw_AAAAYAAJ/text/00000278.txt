THEHISTORY

BOOK that he had quitted the country, and gone into exile;

,• neverthelefs, Virginius prefiding in the afiembly, his

colleagues, on being appealed to, difmifi'ed the meet-

. ing, and the money was exacted from his father with

fuch feverity, that all his property being fold, he

Jived for a long time in an obfcure cottage beyond

the Tiber, as if banifhed from his country. This

trial, and the proceedings about the law, gave full

employment to the ftate. There was no difturbance

from foreign enemies.

XIV. WHILE the tribunes, flumed with this

fuccefs, imagined, from the difmay into which

the patricians had been thrown by the exile of Caefo,

that the patting of the law was almoft certain; and

the elder patricians, for their part, had in fact relin-

quifhed the adminiftration of affairs, the younger

part of them, efpecially thofe who were Caefo's

friends, inftead of fuffering their fpirits to droop,

aflumed a higher degree of vehemence in their rage

againft the commons. But in one particular they

improved their plan exceedingly, tempering the vio­

lence of their exertions with a degree of moderation.

The firft time, after Caefo's banishment, that the law

began to be agitated, having prepared themfclves

for the occafion, and formed in a body with a great

bund of their dependents, as foon as the tribunes af­

forded them a pretext, by ordering them to retire,

they attacked them furioufly, and all exerted them-

felves with activity fo equal, that no one of them

carried home a greater fhare than another, either of

honour, or of ill-will; the commons complained,

that a thoufand Caefbs had ftarted up in the room of

one. During the intermediate days, in which the

tribunes brought forward no proceedings refpecting

the law, nothing could be more mild and peaceable

than thefe lame perfons; they faluted the plebeians

kmdly; entered into converfation with them; in­

vited them to their houles; took care of their

bufinels
