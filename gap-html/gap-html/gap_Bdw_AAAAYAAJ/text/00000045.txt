the city of Rome., g$pe it his name. LCo him fuc- B O O

c£Ctti& Plrocas*1'whdrliad two fons, W umitor and

Amulius. ToNumitor, as being the firftborn, he be­

queathed the ancient kingdom of the Sylvian family;

fcut force prevailed over both the will of their father,

and the refpcct due to priority of birth. I Amuiius

dethroned his brother, Itook pofleflion of the king­

dom, and adding crime to crime, put to death the

male offspring of Numitor, and made his daughter

Rhea Sylvia a veftal, under the fpecious pretence

of doing her honour, but, in fadt, to deprive her of

all hope of iflue, the veftals being obliged to vow

perpetual virginity*.

IV.JBuT the fates, I fuppofe, demanded the

founding of this great city, and the firft eftablifh-

ment of an empire, which is now, in power, next to

the immortal gods. (The veftal being deflowered

by force, brought forth twins, and declared that the

father of her doubtful offspring was Mars, either

becaufe fhe really thought fo, or becaufe fhe hoped

to extenuate the guilt of her tranfgreflion by im­

puting.it to the act of a deity. | But neither gods

nor men fcreened her or her children from the

king's cruelty: [the prieftefs was loaded with chains,

and caft into prifon, and the children were ordered

to be thrown into the ftrearn'of the river, jit hap­

pened providentially that the Tiber overflowing ks

banks, formed itfelf into ftagnant pools in iiich a,

manner, as that the regular channel of the river

was every where inacceffible, and thofe, who carried

the infants, fuppofed that they would be drowned in

any water, however ftill. {Wherefore, as if thereby

fulfilling the king's order, they expofed the boys in

the neareft pool, where now ftands the Ruminal fig-

treex which, it is faid, was formerly called Romular.

/Thofe places were at that time wild defarts. j A ftory
