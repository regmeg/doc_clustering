mons condemned the accufed in a fine of ten thou- t -!_-/

that the mifcarriage was to be imputed to fortune, B.c. J9*'

and the common chance of war; and Virginius made

earneft fupplications that they would not render him •

more unfortunate at home, than he had been in the

field. The current of popular refentment, having

been thus turned againft them, almoft obliterated the

remembrance of the afliimption of tribunes, and the

fraudulent infraction of the Trebonian law. The vic­

torious tribunes, in order that the commons might

reap an immediate advantage from the trial, pub-

tax to be paid, fince pay was required for fuch a

keep their hopes in fufpenfe. For, at Veii, the

camp, which had been loft, was recovered, and

ftrengthened with forts and a garrifon. Here Mar­

furround it with a rampart and trench. This pro­
