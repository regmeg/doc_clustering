OF ROME. 391

the commons fhewed a fuperiority, for they carried B O O K.

the point that confuls mould not be elected for the'

next year.

XXXI. FOUR military tribunes, with confular Y.R.

power, were eleccted, Titus Quintius Pennus from ''

the confulfhip, Caius Furius, Marcus Poftnmius,

and Aulus Cornelius Coflus. Of thefe, Coffus held

the command in the city. The other three, after

£nlifting forces, marched to Veii, and there exhibited

an inftance of the pernicious effects on military ope­

rations refulting from a divided command: while

each maintained an opinion different from the reft,

and endeavoured to enforce his own plans, they gave

an opportunity to the enemy to take them at advan­

tage. Accordingly, the Veientians feizing a critical

moment made an attack on their troops, who knew

not bow to act, one of their generals ordering the

fignal for retreat to be given, another the charge to

be founded. They were thrown into confufion con-

fequently, and turned their backs, but found fafety in

their camp, which was nigh at hand: their difgrace

therefore was greater than their lofs. The citizens,

unaccuftomed to defeats, were ieized with difmal ap-

prehenfions, execrated the tribunes, and called aloud >

for a dictator; in him alone, they faid, the ftate could

place any hopes. Here again a religious fcruple

interfered, left there mould be an impropriety in a'

dictator being nominated by any other than a con-

ful: but the augurs being confulted, removed that

doubt. Aulus Cornelius nominated Mamercus

JEmilius dictator, and was himfelf nominated by him

mafter of the horfe. So little effect had the dilgrace

inflicted by the cenfors, when the ftate once came to

ftand in need of a perfon of real merit, towards .pre­

venting it from feeking a fupreme director of its af-

fairs in a houfe undefervedly cenfured. The Ve­

ientians, puffed up by their fuccefs, fent ambafladors

round. all the ftat.es of Etruria, boafting, that they

c c 4 had.
