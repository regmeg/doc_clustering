XII. THE day of trial now approached, and it

was manifeft that the people in general had conceiv­

ed an opinion, that the exiftence of their liberty de­

pended upon the condemnation of Caefo. Then at

length he was compelled, though not without indig­

nation, to folicit the favour of each: he was follow­

ed by his relations, who were the principal perfons

in the ftate. Titus Quintius Capitolinus, who had

been thrice conful, after recounting many honoura­

ble atchievements of his own, and of his family,

affirmed, that " there never had appeared, either in

"the Quintian family, or in the Roman ftatc, any

"perfon poffefled of luch a capacity, and who ex-

"hibited fo early, fuch difplays of valour. That he

"ferved his firft campaign under him, and had of-

't ten in his fight fought with the enemy." Spuri-

us Furius declared, that " he had, by order of

'' Quintius Capitolinus, come to his relief, when in

"a dangerous fituation; and that there was no one.

"perfon to whom he thought the public fo much

"indebted for the reftoration of their affairs to a

"ftate of fafety." Lucius Lucretius, conful the

preceding year, in the full fplendour of frefh glorr,

attributed to Caefo a lhare of his own merits; enu­

merated the battles he had been in; related extraor­

dinary inftances of his good behaviour, both on ex^

peditions, and in the field of battle; advifed and

warned them, rather " to preferve among them-

"felves, than to drive into a foreign ftate, a youth

"of fuch extraordinary merit, endowed with every

"accomplifhment, which nature and fortune could

"beftow, and who would prove a vaft acceftion to
