THE HISTORY

S O O K the" chieftain of the Gauls, and a thoufand pounds

Y. R. 365. people, who were afterwards to be rulers of the

». C. j??. world. To a tranfaction fo very humiliating in it-

felf, infult was added. Falfe weights were brought

by the Gauls, and on the tribune objecting to them,

of the altercation, the dictator came up to the fpot,

ordered the gold to be carried away from thence,

and the Gauls to clear the place. And when they

made oppofition, and infifted on the agreement, he

affirmed that fuch an agreement could have no vali­

dity, being made after he had been created dictator,

thority j and he gave notice to the Gauls to prepare

.for battle. His own men he ordered to throw their

baggage in a heap, to get ready their arms, and to

recover their country with fteel, not with gold; hav­

wives and children, the fue of their native city,

disfigured with /ubbifh through the calamities of

war, and every obje<£t which they were bound by the

ftrongeft duties to defend, to recover, and to re­

venge. He then drew up his forces for battle, as

the nature of the ground would allow, on the fite of

the half demolifhed city, which was in itfelf naturally

uneven, and made every previous arrangement and

preparation, which could be fuggefted by knowledge

in war, to fecure all advantages in favour of his own
