274 THE HISTORY

[? K cor^'ng to tne rePorts of the people, refpecting each

particular head of the laws publifhed, they appeared

fufficiently correct, then, in an afiembly voting by

centuries, were ratified the laws.of the ten tables,

•which even at this prefent time, after ail the multi­

dignified ftations, lowering their pride to hazard a

conteft of this fort, made Appius Claudius redouble
