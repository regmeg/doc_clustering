THE HISTORY

"nation r" Having received the king's order, he

feid, "O king, I demand vervain from thee:"

the king anfwered, " Take it pure." The herald

brought clean ftalks of that herb from the citadel.

He afterwards afked the king in thefe words;

"Doft thou, O king, conftitute me the royal dele-

"gate of the Roman people, the Quirites; in-

"eluding, in my privileges, my attendants and

"implements." The king replied, " Be it with-

"out detriment to me, and to the Roman people,

"the Quirites, I do conftitute thee." The herald

was Marcus Valerius, and he made Spurius Fufius

Pater Patratus, by touching his head and hair with

league; and this he does in a great many words,

conditions, he faid, " Hear thotf, O Jupiter! hear

"thou, Pater Patratus of the Alban nation: heap,

"ye people of Alba: as thofe conditions, from ftrft

"to laft, have been recited openly from thofe tab-

"will not firft depart: if they mall, at any time, firft

"depart from them, under authority of the ftate,

"through any fraud or deceit, do thou, O Jupiter,

"on that day, ftrike the Roman people in like man-

"ftrike them, thou, with greater fe verity, in pro-

"portion as thy power and ability are greater."

So faying, he ftruck down the fwine with a flint

ftone. The Albans likewife, by their dictator and

rhcir priefts, repeated their form of ratification ar.d

their oath.
