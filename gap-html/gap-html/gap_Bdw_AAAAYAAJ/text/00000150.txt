ii4 THE HISTORY

3 o o K though, by their behaviour, they had deferved to be

^JIJl^, treated as enemies, yet regard to the law of nations

V R. 145. prevailed.

B. C. 507.

V. WITH refpect to the effects of the princes,

which they had before ordered to be reftored, the

bufinefs was now laid before the fenate, for re-con-

fideration; and they, actuated entirely by refent-

ment, decreed, that they mould not be reftored, but

converted to the ufe of the ftate. They were, there­

fore, given up to the commons as plunder, with the

intent, that thefe, after fueh an act of violence

againft the princes, as the plundering of their effedts,

might for ever lofe all hope of reconciliation with

them. The land of the Tarquinii, which lay be­

tween the city and the Tiber, being confecrated to

Mars, has, from that time, been called the Field of

Mars. It happened, that there was then on that

ground a crop of corna ripe for the fickle, and, be-

caufe it would be an impiety to make ufe of this

produce of the field, a great number of men were

fent in at once, who, having cut it down1 carried it

in bafkets, and threw it, grain and ft'raw together,

into the Tiber, whofe waters were low at that time,,

as is generally the cafe in the middle of fummer.

The heaps of corn then being frequently ftopped foe

a while in the fhallows, and having contracted a co­

vering of mud, funk, and remained fixed, and bjr

thefe means, with the afflux of other materials which,

the ftream is apt to carry down, an ifland * was gra­

dually formed. I fi,ppofe that mounds were after­

wards added, and affiftance given by art,, to raifc the

furface to its prefent height, and give k fufficient

firmnefs to fupport temples and porticoes. After

the people had made plunder of the effects, of thev

princes, the traitors were condemned and executed.

* Between the Janiculum anj ilic city. It was afterwards called  
the Holy Ifland, from the number of templet built upon it.
