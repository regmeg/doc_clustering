THE HISTORY

refpect to quaeftors, and finding that

_ this had no effect, they entirely laid afide the defign

I., of augmenting the number of quaeftors. No fooner

B.C.+'*. was it dropped by them, than it was taken up by the

tribunes, and feveral other feditious fchemes were

continually ftarting up, and among the reft, one for

an agrarian law. While the fenate was defirous, on

account of thefe commotions, that confuls mould be

elected rather than tribunes, and no decree of the
