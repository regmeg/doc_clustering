Capitolinus a fourth time, and Agrippa Furius, found, B.C. 443.

at the commencement of their year, neither fedition

at home, nor war abroad, but reafon fufficient to

apprehend both. The difienfions of the citizens

could no longer be kept within bounds, both tri­

bunes and commons being highly exafperated againft

the patricians, and every charge brought againft any

of the nobility conftantly embroiling the afiemblies

with new contefts. As foon as thefe were noifed

abroad, the .ffiquans and Volfcians, as if they had

waited for this fignal, immediately took up arms;

being, at the fame time,-perfuaded by their leaders,

who were eager for plunder, that the levy which had

been proclaimed the laft year had been found im­

practicable, the commons refufing obedience j and

that, for that reafon, no army had been fent againft

none attempting to obftrucl them, and the promoters

of the war highly exulting, they advanced to the

very walls of Rome, carrying on their ravages op-

pofite to the Efquiline gate, infulting the city with a

view of the devaftation of the country. From

thence, they marched back without moleftation, in

regular order, driving the prey before them to Cor-

bio. And then Quintius the conful fummoned the

people to an afiembly.
