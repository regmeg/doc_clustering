9* THE HISTORY

B o o K" becaufe all the Latines, deriving their origin from

'' Alba, were comprehended in that treaty, by which,

'under Tullus, the whole Alban nation, together

"with their colonies, were fubjeccted to the domi-

"nion of the Romans. However, for the fake of

"the general advantage of all parties, he rather
