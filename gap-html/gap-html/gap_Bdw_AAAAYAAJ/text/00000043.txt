the better able to.oppofe fitch formidable 'enemies, B OjO K

gave to both the nations under his government the

name of Latines, that all fhould not only be govern­

ed by the fame laws, but have one common name.

From thenceforth the Aborigines yielded not to the

Trojans in zeal ,and fidelity towards their king

./Eneas. This difpofition of the two nations, who

coalefced daily with greater cordiality, infpired him

with fo great confidence, that, notwithftanding Etru-

•with the fame of its prowefs not only the land, but

the fea alfo, through the whole length of Italy, from

the Alps to' the Sicilian Streight; and although he

might have remained within his fortifications, fecure

from any attack of the enemy, yet he led out his

troops to the field. The battle that followed was,

with refpect to the Latines, their fecond, with refpect

the Latine ftate, and the united fubjects of his father

and grandfather, continued firm in their allegiance

to the young prince. I am not without fome doubts

(for who can affirm with certainty in a matter of fuch

antiquity ?) whether this Was the fame Afcanius men­

tioned above, or one older than him, born of Creu-

fa, wife to .ffineas, before the deftruction of Troy,

and! who accompanied his father in his flight from

thence; whom, being alfo called Julius, the Julian
