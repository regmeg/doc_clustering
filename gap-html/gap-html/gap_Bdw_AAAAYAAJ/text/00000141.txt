OF ROME. • , _ 105

ing, that " the citizens of Rome, the conquerors of8 O.O.K.

'' all the neighbouring nations, were, from warriors,

"reduced to labourers and ftone-cutters;" men­

tioned the barbarous murder of king Servius Tulli-

us, and his daughter driving in her abominable car­

riage over the body of her father, and invoked the

gods to avenge the caufe of parents. By defcanting

on thefe and other, I fuppofe, more forcible topics,

which the heinoufnefs of prefent injuries fuggefts at

the time, but which it is difficult for writers to re­

the king to the office of Praefect of the city*.

During this tumult Tullia fled from her houfe ., both
