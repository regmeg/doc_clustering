being prepared for, and determmed on, a decifive ROOK

action, erofled over the Tiber. The Veientians,

hearing that he was forming a camp, and that he in­

tended to advance to their city, tnarched out to

meet him; for they chofe rather to engage in the

open field, than to remain fhut up, and fight from

the walls and houfes. There, by dint of ftrength,

unafiifted by any ftratagem, the Roman king, through

forty years after, it enjoyed profound peace and

fecurity. He ftood, however, much higher in the

favour of the people than he did in that of the

fenate; and was yet more beloved by his army,

He eftablifhed a body-guard of three hundred men,

whom he called Celeres *; and thefe he kept con-
