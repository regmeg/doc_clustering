took arms; the friends of each putting them in mind,

that " the gods of their country, their country it-

"felf, the whole of their countrymen, whether at

"home, or in the army, refted on their prowefs

"the decifion of their fate." Naturally bold and

couragemis, and highly animated befides by fuch

exhortations, they advanced into the midft bctweer>
