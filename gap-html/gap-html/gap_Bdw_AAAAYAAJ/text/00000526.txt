BOOK ance with the univerfal defire, ambafijadors went to

i^-^l^j the camp to Camillus, and from thence, with permif-

Y.R.36i. fion of Camillus, to Rome, to make a furrender of

JJ.C. 391. Falerii. On being introduced to the fenate, they are

faid to have fpoken in this manner: " Confcript fa-

"thers! Overcome by you and your general, by a

"victory of fuch a kind, as neither God nor man

"can view with difpleafure, we furrender ourfelves

"into your hands, in an expectation which redounds

"in the higheft degree to the honour of the con-

"queror, that we fhall live more happily under

"your government, thr.n under our own laws. In

"the illue of this war two falutary examples have

'* been held out to mankind. Ye have preferred

*c good faith in war, to prefent victory. We, chal-  
"lenged to emulation, in the obiervance of faith,

"have voluntarily prefented you with conqueft.

'' We are your fubjects: fend peribns to receive

"our arms, hoftages, and our city, whofe gates they

"will find open. Ye will never have reafon to com-

*' plain of our fidelity, or we of your government."

man people might enjoy a refpite from the tax. As

brought home to Rome.

diftinguifhed by a conqueft acquired through the

means of juftice and good faith, the fenate did not

conceal their fenfe of the refpectful attention due to

his concerns, but haftened the meafures for acquitting

him of his vow. Lucius Valerius, Lucius Sergius,
