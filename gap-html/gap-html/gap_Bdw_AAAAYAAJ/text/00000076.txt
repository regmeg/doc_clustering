40 THE HISTORY

BOOK ftrength of the ftate was growing languid, through

n_-J-^. inactivity, he fought on all fides for an opportunity

of ftirring up a war. It happened that fome Roman

and Alban peafants committed mutual depredations

on each other's lands: at this time, C. Cluilius held

the government of Alba. Ambafladors were fent

from both fides, at nearly the fame time, to demand

reftitution. Tullus gave orders to his, that they

fhould attend to nothing elfe, until they executed

their commiflion: he well knew that the Alban

would give a refufal, and then war might be pro­

claimed, without incurring the charge of impirty.

The Albans proceeded with lefs difpatch; being

courteoufly and liberally entertained by Tullus in his

palace, they cheerfully enjoyed the pjeafures of the

king's table. Meanwhile, the Romans had made

the firft demand of reftitution, and, on the Alban's

refufal, had declared war to commence on the thir­

tieth day after, and returned to Tullus with an ac­

count of their proceedings. He then gave the am-

bafladors an opportunity of propofins; the bufinefs

of their embafly; they, entirely ignorant of wh:i?

had parted, fpent fome time, at firft, in making apo­

logies; that " it was very difagreeable to them tu

"fay any thing that would not be pleafing to Tul-

"lus, but that they were compelled by their in-

"ftruclions: they came to demand reftitution, and

"if that were not granted, had orders to declare

"war." To this Tullus anfwered: '.' Tell your

"king, that the king of Rome appeals to the

"gods, to judge which of the two ftates firft dii-

"mifled, with a refufal, the atnt>afliidors of the

'c other demanding reftitution; that, upon that

'' llate, tliey may inflict all the calamities of this

y. R. XXIII. THIS anfwer the Albans carried home,

8'• and both parties made the moft vigorous prepara-

ts7.' tions for a war, which might almoft be called a civil

war
