BOOK Virginius, and Quintus Pomponius, plebeian tribunes

of the two preceding years, whom the fenate was

Y.R. 361. bound in honour to defend with the joint exertions

B. C. 390. of all the patricians: for no one laid any other charge

againft them, with refpecl either to their conduct in

life, or their behaViour in office, than that, to grati­

fy the patricians, they had protefted againft the law

propofed by the tribunes. However, the refentment

of the commons overpowered the influence of the

fenate, and by a fentence, of moft pernicious example,

thofe men, convicted of no crime, were condemned

to pay a fine of ten thoufand afes in weight *. This

highly incenfed the patricians: Camillus openly re­

proached the commons with violating the duty which

they owed to their own order, telling them, that

"while they thus vented their fpleen on their own

'' magiftrates, they did not perceive that by their

'c iniquitous fentence againft the tribunes they had

"abolifhedthe privilege ofprotefting, and by taking

"away that privilege, had overturned the tribunitian

"power. For they were much miftaken if they

'' imagined, that the patricians would endure the un-

"bridled licentioufnefs of that office. If tribunitian

"violence could not be repelled by tribunitian aid,

"the patricians would find out a weapon of fome

"other kind. He cenfured the confuls alfo, for

"filently fuffering thofe tribunes, who had complied

"with the directions of the fenate, to be difappoint-

t' ed in their reliance on the faith of the public."

By fuch difcourfes, uttered in public, he exafperated

people daily more and more againft him.

XXX. As to the fenate, he never ceafed urging

them to a vigorous oppofition to the pafilng of the

law j exhorting them, that, " when the day arrived

"on which it was to be put to the vote, they fbould

"go down to the Forum with no other fentiments
