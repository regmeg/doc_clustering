OF ROM&

*c We have pafled an order for the £redhing of a B ° O K

tc temple to Aius Locutius, in the new ftreet, out . -t'._f

"of regard to the heavenly voice which was heard Y:R. 36$.

"there. To our other folemnities we have added B'c.3*7'

"Capitoline games, and have, by direction of the

*' fenate, founded a new college for the perfof niince

'' thereof. Where was there occafion for any of

"thefe inftitutions, if we were to abandon the eity

*' at the fame time with the Gauls; if it was againft

'' our will that we refided in the Capitol, for fo

"many months as the fiege continued; if it was

"through a motive of fear that we fuffered our-

"felves to be held confined there by the enemy?

"Hitherto we have fpoken of the facred rites and

"the temples, what are we now to fay of the

'' priefts? Does it not occur to you, what a de-

'' gree of impiety is to be committed with refpect

"to them? For the veftals have but that one re-

"fidence, from which nothing ever difturbed them,

"except the capture of the.city. And it isdeemed

"impious if the Flamen Dialis remain one night

"out of the city. Do ye intend to make thefe

"Veientian priefts inftead of Roman? And, O

"Vefta, mall thy veftals forfake thee? And fhall

"the Flamen, by foreign refidence, draw every

"night on himfelfj and the commonwealth, fo great

"a load of guilt? What fhall we fay of other

"kinds of bufinefs which we tranfact under aufpices,

"and almoft all within the Pomcerium? To what

"oblivion, or to what neglect, are we to confign

"them? The afiemblies of the Curias, which

"have the regulation of military affairs; the afTcm-

"blies of the centuries, in which ye elciffc confuls

"and military tribunes; where can they be held

"under aufpices, except in the accuftomed place?

'c Shall we transfer thefe to Veii? Or fhall vhe

"people, in order to hold their affemblies, crowd

"together here, with- fo great inconvenience, into

". a city dc.ferted by gods and men?
