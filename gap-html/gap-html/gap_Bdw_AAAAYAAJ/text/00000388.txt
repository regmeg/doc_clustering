THE HIS fOUY

I.v'thfe.year three hundred and ten from the

foundation 6f the city of Rome; for the firft time,

military tribunes irt the room.of confute entered into

;qffice." "tliefe Were Aulus Sempronius Atratinus,

Lucius Acilius, and Titus Ga?eilius'; ami, during their

ct>ntinuan'c& .in office,; concord prevailing at home,

produced likewife peace abroad.' There are fome

writers,' who, without mentioning ifhfe prOpofal of

the law, concerning the election of plebeian confuls,

affirm, that on account of a war.breaking out with

the Veientians, in addition to thofe with the ^quans

and Volfcians, and the revolt of the Ardearts, two

confuls being unequal to the tafk of conducting fo

their election, becaufe Caius Curtius, who had pre.

complaining of the injuftice done to them, and at

die fame time profeffing an intention of remaining in

amity, and adhering to the treaty, provided that, by

"the rcftoration of their lands, that injuftice were rc-

drefled. The fenate anfwered, that " they could

"no other reafon than the prelervation of concord

"between the orders in the ftate; but, befides, fuch

"a meafare was not juftified either by law or pre-

"cedent. If the Ardeans would be content to wait,

''' until they could find a feaibnable conjuncture, and

"leave it entirely to the fenate to find a remedy for

"the injury offered them, they fhould have reafon

"afterwards to rejoice for having moderated their

"refentment, and ihould be convinced that the .
