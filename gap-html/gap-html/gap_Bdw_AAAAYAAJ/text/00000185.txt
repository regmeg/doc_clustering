XXVI. IMMEDIATELY after, the Sabines alfo

caufed an alarm at Rome; but it was, in facct, a tu­

mult rather than a war. An account was brought

•by night to the city, that a Sabine army were plun­

dering the country, and had advanced as far as the

river Anio, and that they were ravaging and burn­

ing all the farms in that neighbourhood: Aulus

Poftumius, who had been dictator in the Latine

•war, was inftantly difpatched thither with all the ca­

valry, and the conful Servilius followed, with a cho-

fen body of foot: the greater part of the ftragglers

were cut off by the cavalry; nor was the main body

of the Sabines capable of refifting the infantry on

their approach; fatigued both by their march and

by collecting booty in the night, a great number of

them in the country houfes, overcharged with meat

and wine, had fcarcely ftrength fufficient to enable

them to fly. Thus was this Sabine war finifhed

within the fame night in which the firft account of

it had been • received. The next day, while fan-

guine hopes were entertained that peace with all

their neighbours was now fecurely eftablifhed, am-

bafladors came to the lenate from the Auruncians,

denouncing war, unlefs the troops were withdrawn

from the territories of the Volfcians: the army of the

Auruncians had fet out from home, at the fame

time with the ambafladors: and intelligence arriv­

ing, that it had been feen not far from Aricia, it

excited fuch an alarm among the Romans, that nei­

ther could the fenate be confulted in a regular man­

ner, nor could they, while bufy themfdves in taking

up arms, give a peaceable anfwer to thofe who

were advancing in arms againft them. The troops

marched againft the enemy to. Aricia, and not far
