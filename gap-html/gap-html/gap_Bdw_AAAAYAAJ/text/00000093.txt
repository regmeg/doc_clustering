fame. At this time an account was brought to the BOOK

king and the fenate that a fhower of ftones had v>'

fallen on the Alban mount. This appearing fcarcely

credible, and fome perfons being fent to examine

into the prodigy, there fell from the air in their

fight, a vaft quantity of ftones, juft as when the

wind drives down hail compacted into lumps. They

imagined alfo that they heard a loud voice from

the grove on the fummit of the hill, ordering, that

the Albans fhould perform religious rites according

to the practice .of their native country. Thefe the

Albans had entirely configned to oblivion, as if,

with their country, they had alfo abandoned its

deities, and had adopted the Roman practice, or

perhaps, incenfed againft fortune, had renounced

the worfhip of the gods. On account of the fame

prodigy, the Romans alfo inftituted for themfelves,

by order of government, a feftival of nine days,

either in obedience to a voice from heaven, uttered

on the Alban mount, for that likewife is mentioned,

or to the directions of the arufpices; the practice

certainly continued, that, whenever an account was

received of the fame prodigy happening, a feftival

for nine days was celebrated. In a fhort time after,

the country was afflicted with a peftilence; and

though this neceflarily rendered men averfe to military

fervice, yet the king, in himfelf fond of war, and

perfuaded that young men enjoyed better health

while employed abroad, than when loitering at

home, gave them no reft from arms, until he was

feized by a tedious diforder. Then, together with

the ftrength of his body, the fiercenefs of his fpirit

was reduced to fuch a degree, that he, who, lately,

thought nothing lefs becoming a king, than to bufy

his thoughts in matters of religion, became, at once,

a flave to every kind of fuperftition, in cafes either

of great or of trifling import, and even filled the

minds of the people alfo with fuperftitious notions.
