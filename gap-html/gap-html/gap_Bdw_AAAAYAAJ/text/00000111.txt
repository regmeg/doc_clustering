guard, with the approbation of the fenate, took pof- B o. p K

fefllon of the kingdom, being the firft who attained .

the fovereignty without the orders of the people.

The fons of Ancus, as foon as they found that the

inftruments of their villainy were feized, and under-

ftood that the king was alive, and that the intereft

of Servius was fo ftrong, had gone into exile to

Suefla Pometia.

XLII. AND now Servius laboured to confirm

his authority, not only by fchemes of a public, but

by others of a private nature. And left the fons of

Tarquinius mould entertain the fame fentiments of

refentment againft him, which had animated the

fons of Ancus againft Tarquinius, he joined his two

daughters in marriage to the young princes, the Tar-

quinii, Lucius and Aruns. But by no human de­

vices could he break through the unalterable decrees

of fate, or prevent envy of the fovereign power

from raifing difcord and animofity, even among

thofe of his own family. Very leafonably for pre-

ferving ftability to the prefent eftablifhment, war

was undertaken againft the Veientians, the truce

with them having expired, and againft the other

EtrOrians. In that war, both the valour and the

good fortune of Tullius were very confpicuous.

And, after vanquifhing a powerful army of the ene­

my, he returned to Rome, no longer confidering

his authority as precarious, whether it were to de­

pend on the difpofition of the Patricians towards

himfelf, or on that of the commons. He then en­

tered on an improvement in civil polity of the ut-

moft importance, intending, that, as Numa had been

the founder of fuch inftiturions as related to the wor-

fhip of the gods, fo pofterity fhould celebrate Servi­

us, as the author of every diftin&ion between the

members of the ftate; and of that fubordination of

ranks, by means of which, the limits between the

feveral degrees of dignity and fortune are exactly

afcertained.
