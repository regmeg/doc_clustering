The Roman citadel was commanded by Spurius BOOK

Tarpeius. His maiden daughter, who had acci- . _'

dentally gone without the fortifications to bring

water for the facred rites, was bribed by Tatius with

gold to admit fome of his troops into the citadel.

As foon as they gained admittance they put her to

death; by throwing their armour in a heap upon her,

either becaufe they wifhed that the citadel fhould

rather appear to have been taken by ftorm, or for the

fake of eftablifhing a precedent that faith was not to

be kept with a traitor. The ftory is told in another

manner; that, as the Sabines generally carried on

their left arms bracelets of great weight, and wore

rings fet with precious ftones, which made a great

fhew, fhe bargained for what they wore on their

left arms; accordingly, inftead of the prefents of

gold which fhe expected, they threw their fhields

Upon her. Others fay, that, in purfuance of their

agreement to deliver up what was on their left

arms, fhe exprefsly demanded their fhields; and

this feeming to be done with a treacherous intent,

(lie was put to death with the very reward which fhe

required.

XII. THE Sabines however kept pofieflion of

the citadel; but though, on the day following, the

Roman army, in order of battle, filled the whole

plain between the Palatine and Capitoline hills, yet

they did not come down to the level ground; until

the Romans, ftimulated by rage and eagernefs to

recover the citadel, advanced to an aflault. The

foremoft champions of the two parties, who animatÂ­

ed the troops to the fight, were Mettius Curtius on

the fide of the Sabines, and Hoftus Hoftilius on

that of the Romans. The latter, in the front of the

army, by his fpirit and intrepidity, enabled the

Romans to fupport the fight, in fpite of the difad-

vantage of the ground; but, on his falling, the

Roman troops quickly gave way, and were driven
