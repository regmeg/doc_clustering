THE HISTORY

BOOKÂ« poor? A matter which in all countries has been

, .J\I,-," left to the regulation of people's own prudence;

Y.R. 310." that each woman fhould marry into whatever fa-

B. c.441. ct mily fhe has been betrothed to; and each man

"take a wife from whatever family he had con-

"tracked with; this ye fhackle with the reftraints of

'' a moft tyrannical law, whereby ye tear afunder

"the bands of civil fociety, and fplit one ftate into
