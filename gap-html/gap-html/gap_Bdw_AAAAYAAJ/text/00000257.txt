III. LEAVING therefore a guard in the camp,

they marched out, and fell upon the Roman frontiers

with fuch fury, as to carry terror even to the city:

fuch an event caufed the greater uneafinefs, becaufe

it was entirely unexpected; for nothing could be

lefs apprehended, than that a vanquifhed enemy,

almoft befieged in their camp, fliould entertain a

thought of committing depredations; and the coun­

try people, in a panick, pouring into the gates, and,

in the excefs of their fright, exaggerating every

thing, cried out, that they were not irnall ravaging

parties, nor employed in plundering; but that the

legions, and the entire army of the enemy, were ap­

proaching, marching with rapid hafte towards the

city, and prepared for an aflault. The firft who

heard thefe rumours from them fpread them about

among others, unatithenticated as they were, and

therefore the more liable to exaggeration; which

caufed fuch a hurry and confufed clamour, every one

calling to arms, as, in fome meafure, refembled the

confternation of a city taken by an enemy. Luckily

Quintius the coniul had corne back to Rome from

Algidum; this proved a remedy for their fears, for

he calmed the tumult, upbraiding them with being

afraid of a vanquifhed enemy, and pofted guards ac

the gates. He then convened the fenate, and hav­

ing, by their directions, ifiued a proclamation for a

ceiTation of all civil bufinefs *, marched out to pro­

tect the frontiers, leaving Quintus Servilius to com­

mand in the city; but he found no enemy in the

country. The other conful encountered the enemy

all proceedings at law were fufpen.kil; the fhops ;!l'u were fhut, and

all civil bufiuefi flopped, until the alarm was over.
