THE HISTORY

B Oiv* K to8ethcr fO affected the enemy, that they withdrew

. -r--f from the Roman territory to the other fide of the

Y.R. 318. Anio: and continuing to retreat, took pofieffion of

B. c. 4.34. (.fog hills between Fidena e and the Anio. Nor did

they defcend into the plains, until the legions of the

Falifcians came to their aid: then, indeed, the camp

of the Etrurians was pitched under the walls of Fi-

denac. The Roman dictator took his poft at a little

diftance from thence, at the conflux and on the

banks of the two rivers, drawing lines acrofs from

one to the other, where the length of ground be­

tween them was not greater than he was able to for­

tify. On the day following, he led out his forces,

prepared for batde.

able to carry on war at fuch a diftance from home,

and being full of confidence in their own prowefs,

were urgent for fighting. The Veientians and Fi-

denatians forefaw greater advantages in protracting

the war. Tolumnius, although the advice of his

countrymen was more agreeable to his own fenti-

ments, yet, fearing left the Falifcians fliould grow

weary of a diftant war, gave notice that he would

fight on the following day. The enemy having de­

clined the fight, added to the confidence of the dic­

tator and the Romans j and, on the day following,

the foldiers openly threatening that they would af-

fault .the camp and the city, if the enemy did not

come to an engagement, both armies marched forth

into the middle of a plain which lay between the

two camps. The Veientians, being fuperior in

numbers, fent a party round, behind the mountains,

who were to attack the Roman camp, during the

heat of the battle. The army of the three ftates

was drawn up in fuch a manner, that the Veientians

formed the right wing, the Falifcians the left, and

the Fidenatians the centre. The dictator charged.
