i4o THE HISTORY

BOOK enemy, and renewed the fight; the dilator's cohort

i-,^-i_i then, for the firft time, engaged in battle; andxwith

Y.R. 155. frefh ftrength and fpirits, falling on the exiles, who

JJ.C. 497. were exhaufted with fatigue, made great flaughter of

them; on this occafion another combat between two

general officers took place; the Latine general, on

feeing the cohort of exiles almoft furrounded by

the Roman dictator, ordered feveral companies from

the referve to follow him inftantly to the front;

Titus Herminius, a lieutenant general, obferving

thefe as they marched up, and, among them, know­

ing Mamilius, who was diftinguifhed by his drefs

and arms, encountered the enemy's general with

force, fo much fuperior to what had been fhewn

a little before, by the mafter of the horfe, that with

one blow he flew Mamilius, driving the fpear through

his fide; and, having himfelf received a wound from

a javelin, while he was ftripping the armour from

his adverfary's body, he was carried off" victorious

to the camp, and expired during the firft drefling

of his wound. The djctator then flew to the ca­

valry, entreating them, as the infantry were now fa­

tigued, to difmount from their horfes, and fupport

the engagement: they obeyed his orders, leaped

down from their hories, flew forward to the van,

and covering themfelves with their targets, took

• poft as the front line: this inftantly revived the cou­

rage of the infantry, when they faw the young men

of the firft diftinction foregoing every advantage in

their manner of fighting, and taking an equal fhare

of the danger; by thefe means, the Latines were at

length overpowered, their troops were beaten from

their ground, and began to retreat: the horfes were

then brought up to the cavalry, in order that they

might purfue the enemy, and the line of infantry

followed. At this juncture, the dictator, omitting

no means of engaging the aid both of gods and

men, is faid to have vowed a temple to Caftor; and

to have proclaimed rewards to the firft, and to the

fccond.
