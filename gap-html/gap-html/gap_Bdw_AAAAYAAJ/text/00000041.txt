Adriatic fea, and expelling the Euganeans, who

then inhabited the tract between the Alps and the

fea, fettled the Trojans and Henetians in the pof-

feflion of the country. The place where they firft

landed is called Troy, and from thence the Trojan

canton alfo has its name; the nation in general were

called Venetians. / JEncas, driven from home by the

fame calamity, but conduced by the fates to an

eftablifhment of more, importance, came firft to

Macedonia; thence, in fearch of a fettlement, he

failed to Sicily, and from Sicily proceeded with his

fleet to the country of the Laurentians *. /Here alfo,

to the fpot where they landed, was given the name

of Troy, j Here the Trojans difembarked; and as,

after wandering about for a great length of time,

they had nothing now left, befide their fhips and

arms, they began to make prey of whatever they

found in the country. On this, king Latinus and

the Aborigines, who were then in pofiefiion of thole

lands, affembled haftily from the city and country,

in order to repel the violence of the ftrangers. 1 Of

what followed, there are two different accounts. „

Some writers fay, that Latinus, being overcome in

induced them to leave their home, and with what

defign they had landed on the Laurentian coaft; and

that, when he was informed that the leader was ./Eneas,

flames of their native city and of their houfes, and

were in fearch of a fettlement, and a place where

'The Trojans were in number about fix hundred.
