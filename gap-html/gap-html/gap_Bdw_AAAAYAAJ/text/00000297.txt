Lavici; from thence into that of Tufculum; and then, x_ -T-'_'

loaded with booty, pitched their camp at Algidum. Y.R. 196.

To that camp came Quintus Fabius, Publius Vo- B.c.«6'

lumnius, and Aulus Poftumius, ambafladors from

Rome, to complain of injuries, and demand redrefs^

in conformity to the treaty. The general of the

/Equans bade them deliver to that oak whatever

melYage they had from the Roman fenate, while he

fhould attend to other bufinefs: a very large oak-

tree hung over the praetorium, and under its fhade

afforded a pleafant feat: to this, one of the ambaf-

fadors, as he was going away, replied, " Let both

"that confecrated oak, and all the gods in being,

"bear witnefs, that the treaty has been broken by

"you, and fo favour both our complaints at prefent,

"and our arms hereafter, as we avenge the violated

"rights of gods and men." On the return'of the

ambafladors to Rome, the fenate ordered one of the

confuls to lead an army to Algidum againft Gracchus;

and gave to the other, as his province, the ravaging

the territories of the /Equans. The tribunes, ac­

apprehenfions of danger.

XXVI. A VERY large body of Sabines, fpreading

hoftile devaluations, advanced almoft to the walls of

the city. The fields were defolated, and the city

ltrr.ck with terror. The commons then cheerfully

took arms, while the tribunes in vain attempted to

diffbade them. Two large armies were raifed.

Nautius led one againft the Sabines, and, pitching

his camp at Ereturn, by detaching fmall parties,

efpecially on incurfions by night, he caufcd fuch de-

folation in the country of the Sabines, that, compared

to it, the Roman territories feemed untouched by

an enemy. Minucius neither met the fame fuc-
