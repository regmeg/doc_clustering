THE HISTORY

that he himfelf had, with difficulty, made his

efcape from the(weapons and fword of his father,

and could in no place confider himfelf fafe, ex.t

"cept among the foes of Lucius Tarquinius. TFor,

"that they might not be deceived, the war againft

"them, which was pretended to be laid afide, was

"them, and that they expected, in amort time, to

"fee the feat of war transferred, with his affiftance,

"from the gates of Gabii, to the walls of Rome."
