BOOK already made fome progrefs, fhould, as fpeedily aS

.. ^r^_. poffible, be ripened into a perfect union between the

Y.R. 175. plebeians and patricians. In the beginning of the

fc.C. 477. ycar therefore he propofed, that " before any tri-

"bune fhould ftand forth to prefs the agrarian

"law, the fenate Ihould feize the opportunity, and

"take to themfelves the merit of conferring that fa-

"vour: that they fhould diftribute among the com-

wars, two of which were juft ready to break out, with

the ./Equans and Volfcians, who only kept them­
