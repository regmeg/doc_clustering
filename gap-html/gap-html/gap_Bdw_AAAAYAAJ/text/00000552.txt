5i<S THE HISTORY

SOCK the Gauls was approaching, and that the people cf

Ardea in confternation were met in counfeF on the

tion, he advanced into the midft of their afiembly,

having hitherto been accuftomed to abfent hirnfelf

from fuch sheetings, and faid, " People of Ardea,

'' my friends of old, of late my fellow-citizens alfo,

"a relation encouraged by your kindnefg, and;

"formed by my fortune; let not any of you imagine,
