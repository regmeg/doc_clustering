28o THE HISTORY

BOOK were fo thoroughly frightened, on finding the city

t _^_' _, furrounded by two enemies at once, that they deter-

Y. R. 3oj. mined to have recourle to the advice of the fenate;

B. c. 447. accordingly they ordered the fenators to be fuminon-

ed to a meeting, though they well knew what a

ftorm of public refentment threatened to break up­

on themfelves; that all men would heap, on their

heads, the blame of the devaftations of the country,
