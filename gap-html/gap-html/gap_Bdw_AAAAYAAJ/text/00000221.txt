engagement: they thought they might continue their

infults with perfect lafety; that the foldhrs would not

be intrufted with arms; that the bufinefs would end Y.R.

in a defperate mutiny; and that the final period of B.<''47**

the Roman empire was arrived. Buoyed up with

thefe hopes, their parties prefied forward to the very.

gates, heaped reproaches on the troops, and hardly

refrained from aflauUing the camp: but now, the

Romans could no longer endure fuch infults; from

every quarter of the camp, they ran haftily to the

confuls, and did not, as before, propofe their de­

mand, regularly, through the principal centurions,

but every one of them joined in one general cla­

mour. The affair was now ripe; yet ftill the con-

fuls fhewed a backwardnefs: at length beginning,

from the uproar continually increafing, to dread a

mutiny, Fabius, with the confent of his colleague,

having caufed filence by found of trumpet, faid,

f' Cneius Manlius, that thofe men are able to con-

'•i quer, I know; but they themfelves have given

"me realbn to doubt, whether it is their wifh: for

"which realbn I am refolved and determined not to

"give the fignal, unlefs they fwear that they will

"return from the battle with victory. Soldiers

*' have once deceived a Roman conful in the field,  
'' but they will never deceive the gods." There

•was a centurion, called Marcus Flavoleius, who was

among the foremoft in demanding battle; he cried

out, " Marcus Fabius, I will return victorious from

fc the field;" and, at the fame time, imprecated on

himfelf the anger of father Jupiter, of Mars Gradivus,

and the other gods, if he did not perform his pro-

mife: after him the whole army feverally took the

fame oath. As foon as they had fworn, the fignal

was given j inftantly they took arms, and marched

out to battle, full of rage and of confidence: they

each of them bade the Etrurians now throw out their

reproaches; now let the enemy, who was fo alert in

words, cQrne in the way of their arms; there was not

a man.
