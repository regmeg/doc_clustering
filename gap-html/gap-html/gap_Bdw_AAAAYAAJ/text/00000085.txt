Curiatii, which were hung up in the place where BOOK

now ftands the Horatian column; " O my fellow-

"citizens," he exclaimed, "can you bear to be-

"hold him laden with chains, and condemned to

"ignominy, ftripes, and torture, whom, but juft

"now, you law covered with the ornaments of

"victory, marching in triumph! a fight fo horrid,

"that fcarcely could the eyes of the Albans them-

"felves endure it. Go, Licctor, bind the arms,

'c which, but now, wielded thofe weapons which

"acquired dominion to the Roman people: cover

"the head of that man, to Whom your city owes

"its liberty: hang him upon the gallows: fcOurge

"him, within the Pomcerium; but do it betweert

"thofe pillars, to which are fufpended the trophies

"of his victory: fcourge him, without the Pomce-

rc rium, but do it between the tombs of the Curiatii.

"For to what place can ye lead this youth, where

"the monuments of his glory would not redeem

"him from the ignominy of fuch a punimment?"

The people could not withftand eitlier the tears of

the father, or the intrepid fpirit of the youth him-

felf, which no kind of danger could appal, and ra­

the juftice of his caufe, they palTed a fentence of ac­

quittal. Wherefore, that fome expiation might be

made for the act of manifeft murder, the father was

ordered to make atonement for his fon at the public

cxpence. After performing expiatory facrifices,

which continued afterwards to be celebrated by the

Horatian family, he laid a beam acrofs the ftreet,

and, covering the young man's head, made him

,pafs, as it were, under the yoke. The beam re­

mains to this day, being conftantly kept in repair

at the expence of the public, and is called the lifter's

beam. A tomb of fquared ftone was raifcd for

Horatia, on the fpot where fhe fell.
