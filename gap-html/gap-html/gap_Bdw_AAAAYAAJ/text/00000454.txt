THE HISTORY

K fcarct'ty was there any of the public territory, not

even the ground on which the city itfelf was built,

y.R. 339. but what had been acquired by arms; all of which

B.C.413. confequently muft have been comprehended in this

law; nor could the military tribunes, either in the

fenate, or in the private meetings of the nobles, de-

vife, in this exigency, any promifing plan of con-

duet: when Appius Claudius, grandfon of him

who had been decemvir for compiling the laws, be­

ing the youngeft fenator in the afiembly, is faid to

have told them, that " he had brought from home,

"for their ufe, an old fcheme, which had been firft

"devifed by his family:—that his great grandfather

"Appius Claudius had fhewn the patricians one me-

"thod of baffling the power of the tribunes, by the

"protefts of their colleagues:—that new men were

"eafily drawn oft from their defigns by the influence

"of people of confequencc, if they were addrefied

"in language fuited to the times rather than to the

^ dignity of the fpeakers. Their fentiments were

"ever dictated by their circumftances. When they

"fhould fee that their colleagues who firft fet the

"bufinefs on foot had got the ftart of them, and

*' monopolized the whole credit of it with the com-  
"mons, and that there was no room left for them

"to come in for any fhare, they would, without

"reluctance, lean for fupport to the caule of the.

"fenate, by means of which they might conciliate

"the favour, not only of the principal patricians,

"but of the whole body." Every one expreffing

their approbation, and particularly Quintus Servilius

Prifcus, highly commending the youth for not hav­

ing degenerated from the Claudian race, a general

charge was given, that they fhould gain over fuch

of the college of tribunes, as any of them could, to

enter protefts. On the breaking up of the fenate,

the principal patricians made their applications to

the tribunes, and by perfuafions, admonitions, and

promifes that it would be .acknowledged as a favour
