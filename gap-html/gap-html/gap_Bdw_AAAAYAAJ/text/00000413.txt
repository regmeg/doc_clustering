tins and Quintus Tubero mention Marcus Manlius

and Quintus Sulpicius as confuls of that year. Yet,

in fupport of reprefentations fo widely different, both

Tubero and Macer cite the linen books as their auÂ­

thority. Neither of them difallows it being recorded

by antient writers, that there were military tribunes

in that year. Licinius is of opinion, that the linen

books ought to be implicitly followed. Tubero

cannot determine pofitively on either fide. But this

is a point, which, among others, involved in ob- *

fcurity by length of time, muft be left undetermined.

The capture of Fidenas fpread a great alarm in

Etruria; for not the Veienuans only, were terrified

with apprehenfions of fimilar ruin, but the Falfcians

alfo, confcious of having commenced the war at firft,

in conjunction with them, although they had not

joined them in the renewing of hoftilities. Thofe

two ftates, therefore, having fent ambafladors round

all the twelve ftates, and procured an order for a

general meeting of all the ftates of Etruria at the

temple of Voltumna, the fenate, apprehenfive of a

powerful attack from that quarter, ordered Mamer-

cus ./Emilius to be a fecond time appointed dictator.

He appointed Aulus Poftumius Tubertus mafter of

the horfe, and made more powerful preparations for

the campaign than had been made for the laft, in

proportion as the danger was greater from the whole

* Villa pubHca. It was deftined to public iiles, fueh as holding  
the ' cenfus' or Ajryey of the peo^lr, the reception of ambafiadors, &c.
