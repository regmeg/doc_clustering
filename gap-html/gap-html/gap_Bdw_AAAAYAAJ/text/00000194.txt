THE HISTORY

BOOK and beaten out of their camp by the dictator. Hff

^- _J__j had at firft, by a charge of his cavalry, thrown the

Y.R. 160. centre of the enemy's line into diforder; which,

B. C.491. while they extended their wings too far, they had not

fufficiently ftrengthened by a proper depth of files:

before they could recover from this confufion, the

infantry fell upon them, and continued their attack,

without intermiJTion, until they made themfelves

mafters of their camp, and put a conclufion to the

war. Since the battle at the lake Regillus, there had

not been obtained in thofe times, a more glorious

victory than this: the dictator entered the city in

triumph, and befides the accuftomed honours, there

•was a place in the circus affigned to him and his

pofterity, for a feat, and a curule chair fixed in it.

From the vanquifhed Volfcians the lands of the

diftricl: of Velitrse were taken, for which inhabitants

were fent from the city, and a colony eftablifhed

there. Soon after this, a battle was fought with the

.fliquans, againft the inclination indeed of the con-

ful, who confidered the difadvantage of the ground

over which the troops had to march up to the ene­

my j but the foldiers, accufing him of protracting

the bufinefs on purpofe, in order that the dictator

might go out of office before they fhould return to

the city; and tb his promifes fall to the ground with­

out effect, as had thofe of the conful before, they at

length prevailed on him to march up his troops, at

all hazards, againft the fteep of the mountain : ram as

this undertaking was, yet, through the cowardice of

the enemy, it was crowned with luccefs; for, before

a weapon could be thrown, ftruck with amazement

at the boldnefs of the Romans, they abandoned their

camp, which they had fixed in a very ftrong pofition,

and ran down precipitately into the vallies, on the

oppofite fide: there the Romans gained a bloodlefs

victory, and abundance of'booty. Though their

arms were thus attended with fuccefs, in three differ­

ent quarters, neither patricians nor commons were

delivered
