xxviii PREFACE.

To the public judgment, therefore, he fub-

mits his labour; knowing that every en­

deavour of his, except that of rendering it

worthy of acceptance, would be ufelefs; and

that, in fpite of his utmoft exertions, his book

will fland or fall, by its own merit or demerit,

whichever fhall be found to preponderate.

The public candour he has no reafon to doubt;

and he awaits its decifion with tranquillity, but

not without anxiety.
