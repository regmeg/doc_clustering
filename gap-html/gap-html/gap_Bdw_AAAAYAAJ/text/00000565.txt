"of the powerful effects produced on the affairs of

"men by their cither honouring or neglecting the

"Deity, do ye not perceive, Romans, what an act of

"impiety we are about to perpetrate; even in the

"very moment of emerging from the wreck and ruin

"which followed our former mifconduct? We arc

"in pofieffion of a city built under the direction of

"aufpices and auguries, in which there is not a fpot

"but is full of gods and religious rites. The days

"of the anniverfary facrifices are not more pre-

"cifely ftated, than are the places where they are

"to be performed. All thefe gods, both public

"and private, do ye intend, Romans, to forfake?

"What fimilitude does your conduct bear to that,

"which lately, during the fiege, was beheld, with

"no lefs admiration, by the enemy, than by your-

u felves, in that excellent youth Caius Fabius, when

c' he went down from the citadel through the midft

"of Gallic weapons, and performed on the Quiri-

"nal hill the anniverfary rites pertaining to the Fa-

"bian family? Is it your opinion that the religious

"performances of particular families fliould not be

'' intermitted, though war obftruct, bi;t that the

"public rites and the Roman gods fhould be for-

"faken even in time of peace; and that the pontiffs

"and flamens fhould be more negligent of the public

"rites of religion, than a private perfon was of his

"family rites? Some perhaps may fay, we will

'' perform thefe at Veii, or will fend our priefts

"hither from thence to perform them: neither of

"thefe can be done without an infringement of the

"eftablifhed forms. Even in the cafe of the feaft of

"Jupiter, not to enumerate all the feveral gods,

"and all the different kinds of facred rites, can

*' the ceremonies of the Lectifternium be performed
