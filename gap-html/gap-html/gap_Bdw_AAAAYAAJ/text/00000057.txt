OF ROME. 21

his army, and, without much difficulty, taught them BOOK

that rage without ftrength avails but little./ He

routed and difperfed their army; purfued it in its

flight; flew their king in the battle, and feized his

fpoils; and, after the death of the enemy's leader,

made himfelf mafter of their city at the firft affault.

From thence he led home his victorious army; and

being not only capable of performing fplendid ac­

tions, but aMb fond of difplaying his actions to ad­

vantage, he marched up in proceffion to the Capitol,

carrying on a frame, properly conftruifted for the

purpofe, the fpoils of the enemy's general whom he

had 'flain'; and there laying them down under an

oak, which the fhepherds accounted facred, he, at

the fame timey while he offered this prefent, marked

out with his eye the 'bbunds of a temple for Jupiter,

to whom he gave a new name, faying, " Jupiter

"Feretrius*, in • acknowledgment of the victory

"which I have obtained, I, Romulus, king, offer

"to thee thofe fpoils of a king, and dedicate a tem-

"ple to thee in that fpot which I have now mea-

"Aired out in my mind, to be a repofitory for thofe

"grand fpoils, which, after' my example, generals

"in future times fhall offer, on flayihg the kings

"and generals of their enemies." This was the

origin of that temple which was the firft confecrated

in Rome. Accordingly, it pleafed the gods fo to

order, afterwards, that neither the prediction of the

founder of the temple, intimating that'future ge­

nerals mould carry fpoils thither, proved groundlefs,

nor was the honour of making that offering rendered

common, by being imparted to many. In after-times,

during fo many years, and fo many wars, there have

* So called, from the feretnim, or frame, fnpportfng the fpoils. The  
eeond fpolia upima, or grand fpoils, were offered by Cornelius Coflus,

who killed Tolumnius, king of the Veiaitians; and the third by

Claudius Marcellus, who killed Viridorriarus, a king of the Gauls.

Tlie fpoiU, called fpolia O|,iaia, or grand, or chief, fpoils, were fo ^

denominated when they were taken from a king or general in chief,

command ing an army.
