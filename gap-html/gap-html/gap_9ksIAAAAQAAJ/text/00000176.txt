164 THE PELOPONNESIANWAR. B.VI.

no inclination to unite together in our common de-

** fence, in order to give them most signal proofs,  
** thatinSiiily are neither Ionians, nor Hellespontins,  
** noriflanders, who will be slaves, though ever chan-  
"g'ng their master, one while to the Mede, and soon

"after to whoever will please to govern — but, on the

"contrary, that we are Dorians, who from Pelopon-

"nesus, that seat of liberty and independence, came to

** dwell in Sicily. Shall we, therefore, protract our u-  
"nion, till, city after city, we are compelled to a fub-

** mission? we—? who are convinced that thus only  
"we can be conquered, and when we even behold that

"thus our foes have dressrd up their plan; amongst

** some of our people scattering dissentions, setting o-  
** thers to war down each other for the mighty recom-  
** pence of their alliance, cajoling the rest as may best  
** soothe the pride or caprice of each, and avail themselves  
** of these methods to work our ruin? We even in-  
* * dulge the wild imagination, that, though a remote  
** inhabitant of Sicily be destroyed, the danger can ne-  
** ver come home to ourselves; and that he who pre-  
** cedes us in ruin is unhappy only in and for himself.

"Is there now a man amongst you who imagines,

"that merely a Syracusan, and not himself, is the ob-

** ject of Athenian enmity, and pronounceth it hard  
** that he must be exposed to dangers in which I only  
** am concerned? Let such an one with more solidity  
"reflect; that, not merely for what is mine, but equally

** also for what is his own, he should associate with me,  
"though within my precincts; and that this may be

** done with greater security now, since as yet I am not  
"quite destroyed, since in me he is sure of a stedfast

** ally, and before he is bereaved of all support may  
** hazard the contention. And let him farther rest as-  
** lured, that it is not the fole view of the Athenian to  
** bridle enmity in a Syracusan j but, under the colour  
"of that pretext, to render himself the more secure,

"by gaining for a time the friendship of another.
