should be totally abandoned, and that their whole con­

federacy would go over to the Lacedæmonians. They

concluded that, through the prevalence of the Lacedæ­

monian arguments, the Bœotians had been persuaded to

level Panactum and accede to the treaty made with A-

thens, and that the Athenians were privy to all these

steps; and so, of consequence, they themselves were

now utterly excluded from an alliance with the Athe­

nians, and their former hopes entirely blasted, that, in

case disputes should arise, and their treaty with the La­

cedæmonians not be renewed, they might, at worst,

depend on gaining the Athenian alliance. The Ar-

their arrival had a conserence with the Lacedæmonians

about the terms of a peace; and at first the Argives in­

variance; in this district stand the cities of Thyrea and

Anthena, and the possession of it is in the hands of the

Lacedæmonians. But, at length, when the Lacedæ­

monians would not suffer any mention to be made of this,

declaring only, that, " were they willing to renew the

the Argive embassadors, however, prevailed upon the
