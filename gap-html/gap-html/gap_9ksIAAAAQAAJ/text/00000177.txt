'* If others, again, entertain any envy or jealousy

"of Syracuse, for, to each of these, great States are ge-

"nerally obnoxious, and would take delight in seeing

'* us depressed, in order to teach us moderation, though

*' not totally destroyed, from a regard to his own pre-  
*' scrvation, — these are such sanguine wishes, as, in the  
*' course of human affairs, can never be accomplished:  
*( Because it is quite impossible, that the same person  
*£ shall build up airy schemes to soothe his own passions  
"and then insure their success. And thus, should

"some sinister event take place, quite sunk under the

** weight of his own calamity, he would perhaps be  
*c soon wishing again, that I was so replaced as to ex-  
"cite his envy. Impossible, this, for one who aban-

"doned my defence, who refused before-hand toparti-

*' cipate my dangers, — dangers, though not in name,  
"yet in reality, his own! For, if names alone be re­

garded, he acts in the support of my power; but,

if realities, of his own preservation.

*' Long since, ye men of Camarina, it was incum­  
bent on you, who are borderers upon us, and must

be our seconds in ruin, to have foreseen these things,

and not to have abetted our defence with so much re-

missness as you have hitherto done it. You ought to

have repaired to our support with free and voluntary

** aid; with such as, in case the Athenians'had begun  
first with Camarina, you would have come with ear­

nest prayers to implore from us: So cordial and so a-

lert you should have appeared in our behalf, to avert

«' us from too precipitate submissions. But these things

*' never were; not even you, nor any other people,  
** have shewed such affection or alacrity for us.

*' From timorousnels of heart you will study perhaps  
** a manage both wirh us and the invaders, and alledge,  
that there are treaties subsisting between yourlelves and

"the Athenians. Yet theie treaties you never made to

** hurt your friends, but to repel the efforts of your  
f foes, should they dare to attack you. By them you
