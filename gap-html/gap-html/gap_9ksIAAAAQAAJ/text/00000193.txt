B.VI. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. i8x

"That these or any of these points be executed with

"dispatch and vigour, dependeth, ye Lacedæmo-

"nians, on yourselves alone. I can confidently aver

*' that all are feasible, and I think I shall not prove mis-  
M taken in my sentiments. I ought not to suffer in the

*' opinion of any Lacedæmonian, though, once ac-  
*' counted the warmest of her patriots, I now strenu-  
*' oufly join the most inveterate foes of my cuuntry;  
"nor ought my sincerity to be suspected by any as if I

** suited my words to the sharp resentments of an exile,  
** I am driven from my country, through the malice  
"of men who have prevailed against me; but not

*' from your service, if you hearken to my counsels.  
"Your enmity is sooner to be forgiven, who have hurt

*' your enemies alone, than their's, who by cruel treat-  
"ment compel friends to be foes. My patriotism is'

'* far from thriving under the injustice I have suffered;

"it was merely an effect of gratitude for that protection

". I once enjoyed from my country. Nor have 1 reason

"at present to imagine, that against my country I am

"now going to march, so much as to recover some

** country to myself, when at present I have none at all.  
"And 1 judge the person to be a true lover of his

"country, not him who, exiled from it, abandons

** himself without a struggle to his own iniquitous fate,

"but who, from a fondness for it, leaves no pro-

"ject unattempted to recover it again.

"As these are my sentiments, I may fairly, ye La-

*' cedæmonians, insist upon your acceptance of my ser-  
** vice without diffidence or fear, whatever dangers or  
"whatever miseries may hereafter result. You well

*' know the maxim, which universal consent will evince

"to be good, that if, when an enemy, I hurt you

*' much, when I am now become your friend, I can  
*' help you more. Nay, for the latter I am better qua-  
lifted on this very account, that I am perfectly ac-

"quainted with the state of Athens; whereas 1 was on-

** ly able to conjecture at your's. And, as you are
