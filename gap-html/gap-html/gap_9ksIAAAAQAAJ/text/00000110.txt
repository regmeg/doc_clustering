98 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VL

"the Selinuntians." And, in pursuance of this, the

embassadors from the Athenians were sent to Sicily.

The Lacedæmonians, in the same winter, joined by

their allies, those of Corinth excepted, and marching

into Argia, ravaged a small part of that territory, and

carried off the corn, having brought carriages for that

purpose. They also removed the Argive exiles to Or-

nea, and left them a small detachment from their main

army for the security of their persons. A temporary

truce being also made, during which the Orneatæ and

Argives were to abstain from all hostilities against one

another, they drew off the army to their respective

homes.

However, not long after this, the Athenians arrived

with thirty sail of ships and six hundred heavy-armed.

The Argives, in conjunction with the Athenians, took

the field with all their strength, and besieged those in

Grnea for the space of a day. But, as at night the be­

siegers removed to a distance in order for repose, those

of Ornea made their escape. On the day following,

the Argives, when sensible of their escape, levelled Or­

nea with the ground, and then withdrew. And after­

wards the Athenians re-embarked for Athens.

The Athenians also threw in by sea a party of horse-

'men into Methone, a frontier-town on Macedonia.

"With these, consisting of their own citizens and such

Macedonians as had refuged among them, they harras-

sed the country belonging to Perdiccas. But the Lace­

dæmonians sent a summons of aid for Perdiccas to the

Chalcideans of Thrace, who kept terms with the Athe­

nians by truces renewed every tenth day: These howe­

ver refused to march. Thus ended the winter, and with

it the sixteenth year of the war, of which Thucydides

hath compiled the history.
