B.VTIt. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 305

This being done, they again repaired to Miletus; and

from hence they detach Pædaritus, the son of Leon,

whom the'Lacedæmonians had sent expressly to be go­

vernor of Chios, to march over land to Erythræ, ha­

ving under his command the auxiliaries who had served

under Amorges; and appoint Philippus to command at

Miietus. And the summer ended.

The winter now succeeding, after Tissaphernes had

garrisoned and provided for the security of Iasus, he re­

paired to Miletus, and distributed a month's subsistence,

in pursuance of his engagements at Lacedæmon, to all

the ships, at the rate of an * Attic drachma to each ma­

riner by the day; but for the remainder of time he de­

clared he would only pay at the rate of Jdiree oboli, till

he had consulted the king's pleasure; and, in cs"; his

master's orders were for it, he said, he would make it

up a complete drachma. But, as Hermocrates, the Sy-

racusan commander, remonstrated sharply against this

usage, (for Theramenes, not regarding himlelf as ad­

miral, since he was now at the head of the fleet merely

to carry it up to Astyochus, was very indolent about the

article of pay,) it was at length compromised, that ex­

cepting the five supernumerary ships, the crews of the

reft should receive more than three oboli a man: For to

the five and fifty ships he paid -f thiee talents a month;

•f- Thrre is manifestly a fault here; for Tfia, three, in the original, should
be read

.j-gtaxorV, thirty, talents a month. Mr. Hobbes hath taken the pains to
compute,

and finds that the Peloponnesian ships carried eighteen men apitce. What i
only so

imall a crew as eighteen men for a ship of war with three banks of oars ? or,
where

(he complement was perhaps two hundred, did Tissaphernes only pay a tenth part
of

that number? Xenophon, in the first book of his Greek history, enables us to
set all to

light;, Lyfander is negotiating with Cyrus for an increase of pay. Cyrus
insists upon

Che former agreement, made by Tissaphernes, that every ship should receive but

*h:rty m'wa a month. The daily pay of each was of course one mha, or one hun­  
dred drachmas: Whence it appears, that, at chree oboli, or half a drachma, a
man, the

pay of sixty ships, each carrving two hundred men, would be just thirty
talents.

Thirty talents, therefore, paid to silty-five shifS for a month, wat two
talents and a half
