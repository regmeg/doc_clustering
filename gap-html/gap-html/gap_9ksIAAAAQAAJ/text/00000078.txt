M THE FELOPONNESIAtf WAR: B.V.

But, during the approach, Agis, the king, bethought

himself of making a new disposition.—It is the constant

cafe with all armies, that, upon the right, their wings,

whilst they approach one another, extend themselves

too far, so that constantly, on both sides, the left wing

is overreached and flanked by the enemy's right. This

proceedeth from the dread every soldier lieth under of

being exposed on his unarmed side, which maketh him

eager to get it covered by the shield of the next person

on his right, and positive that a firm closing together,

in this manner, will render them impenetrable to the

shock of the enemy. This turn of the body is first be­

gun by the right-hand man of the whole front, and is

the result of his constant care to shift his defenceless side

from the aim of the foe; and the dread of being in the

same manner exposed obligeth all the rest to follow his

motion. And thus, in the present approach, the Man-

tineans in their wing had far overreached the Skiritæ;

but the Lacedæmonians and Tegeatæ had done so, more

in regard to the Athenians, in proportion as they exceed­

ed them in numbers. «*- Agis, therefore, fearing lest the

left wing of the Lacedæmonians might be quite sur­

rounded, and judging that the Mantineans quite too

Arming to battle; and, instead of rage,

Deliberate valour breath'd, firm, and unmov'd

l With dread of death to flight dr foul retreat:

Nor wanting pow'r to mitigate and swage,

With solemn touches, troubled thoughts, and chafe

Anguish, and doubt, and fear, and sorrow, and puin(

From mortal or immortal minds. Thus they,

Breathing united force, with fixed thought,

Mov'd on in silence to soft pipes, that charm'd

Their painful steps o'er the burnt foils And nowa

Advanc'd in view, they stand, a horrid front

Of dreadful length and dazzling arms, in guise

Of warriors old with order'd spear and sliield,

Awaiting what command their mighty chief

Had to impose.- He through the armed files i

Darts his rxperiene'd eye j and soon, traverse

The Whole battalion, views their order due,
