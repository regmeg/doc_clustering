B.VI. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAft. 167

'** assailant be invigorated by success, what can such ab-

lt sensing of yourselves avail, but to help forwards the

"ruin of the one, and afford free scope to the pernicious

"schemes of the other? And how glorious would the

"reverse of this conduct be, would you exert your ef-

forts to redress the injured, who also by the ties

"of consanguinity have a right to expect it from you j

** to guard the common welfare of Sicily; and not suf-  
** fer your friends, your good friends, the Athenians,  
** to run out into a course of outrage!

** In a word, we Syracusans have now only this to  
'* add: That arguments are superfluous, either for the

"instruction of you or of others, in points whose ten-

** dency you know as clearly as ourselves. But we ear-  
** nestly conjure you, and, if prayers will not avail, we  
** boldly protest against you, that, as the worst designs  
** are formed against us by our eternal foes, the Io-  
"nians, you would act as you ought •,—-if not, that by

** you we are basely betrayed, Dorians by Dorians.  
"If such must be our fate, if by the Athenians we

** must be destroyed, they will be indebted for their  
*c success to your determinations, but the glory ,of it  
** will be totally assumed by themselves. Nay, the  
u chief reward they will reap from the victory will be

** this, to inflave the persons who enabled them to gaia  
** it. But then, should the victory rest with us, you are  
** the men from whom we shall exact revenge for all the*  
"dangers to which we have been exposed. Examine

** things, therefore, and declare your resolution, either  
** at once, without embarking into dangers, to put on  
•** the Athenian chains; or, with us, to face the storm

** and earn your preservation; not basely bending to  
"the yoke of foreign tyrants, and preventing an enmi-

** ty with us which will not quickly be appeased."

In these words Hermocrates harangued the Camark

peans: And, when he had ended, Euphemqs, embas­

sador of the Athenians, replied as follows:
