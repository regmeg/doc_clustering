B.VIIL THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 341

The party which at this juncture was subsisting atSa-

mos against the nobility, and were of the popular side,

having now altered their schemes, and followed the sug­

gestions of Pilander ever since his return from Athens,

and gained the concurrence of Athenians at Samos,

combined together by oath to the number of about three

hundred, and resolved to fall upon their antagonists, as

factious on the side of the people. Accordingly, they

murder one * Hyperbolus, an Athenian, a scurvy fel-

Z 3 low,

* Thii wai the person whom the ostracism made in some measure famous, and  
who made the ostracism quite infamous. Plutarch hath repeated the story
thrice.

The following extract is taken from the life of Nicias.

"When the opposition wai very hot at Athena between Alcibiades and Nicias,

*' and the day for ostracixtng was drawing on, which at certain intervals the peu-

'* pie of Athens were used to inforce, and fend away into a ten years exile
some

"one citizen suspected of designs against their liberty, or odious for being
too il-

"lustrious or rich, —— each of these grand competitors was under grievous
appre.

« hensions, and with reason too, that it might be hit own lot to be exiled on
this

"occasion. Alcibiades was hated for his way of life, and for his bold and
enter-

"prising genius. Nicias was envied on account of his wealth; hit way of living

"was neither sociable nor popular; as he avoided a crowd, and herded with a
few

"intimates, he gave great distaste ; besides, as he had often opposed the
caprices of

"the people, and constrained them to pursue their real interest, he was deep
in

** their displeasure. In short, the contest ran high between the young and military  
"men on one side, and the old pacific Athenians on the other, whilst each

"were endeavouring to throw the ostracism upon the hated object. But,

"Parties ran high, and scoundrels got renown,

"Such distensions in the community gave scope to knaves and incendiaries.
There

*' was one Hyperbolus, of Ferithadae, very assuming without the least reason to be  
"fo; however, by dint of impudence working himself into power, and the
disgrace

*' of his country so soon as he had made himself conspicuous in it. On this oc-  
"canon Hyberbolus could have no suspicion of becoming himself the butt of an

"eftratijm; he had a much better title to the gallows. Presuming, on the
contrary,

"that, when either of these great men were exiled, he himself could easily
make

"head against the other, he manifested great pleasure at the contest, and
irritated

"the fury of the people against them both. Nicias and Alcibiades, perceiving
hla

"roguish intent, conferred privately together; and, getting their several
factions to

"unite, secured one another, and threw the votes on Hyperbolus. Such a turn

"at first gave the Athenians much pleasure and diversion j yet soon after they
were

*' highly chagrined, by reflecting that making such a scoundrel the object of it was  
"fluming the ostraeijm for ever. There was dignity even in punishments: The

- ostracism was of such a nature u to suit a Thucydides, an Aristides, and men of
