30 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B. V,

They also again brought back the Delians to Delos,

induced to it by the many defeats they had suffered in

battle, and the express oracle of the god at Delphi.

The Phocians also and Locrians began about this

time to make war upon one another.

And now the Corinthians and Argives, united ifl

league, go together to Tegea, to persuade its revolt

from, the Lacedæmonians. They saw it was a large

district; and, in case they compassed its accession, they

imagined the whole of Peloponnesus would be ac their

"are confederates of the Lacedæmonians." And, up­

on the whole, the Bœotians absolutely refused to re­

upon ir, and urged, with some warm expostulations,
