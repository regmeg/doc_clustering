126 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.Vf,

"which,' though perhaps, inured as you are to domestic

indolence, ic may not gain your ready approbation,

rt I (hall however boldly recommend. Would all of

"us in general who are inhabitants of Sicily, or at least

** would only we Syracusans, with what other people  
"we Can get to assist us, put out instantly to sea with

** all the ships we have in readiness, and victualled  
** but for the space of two months;— would we then  
** giVe'these Athenians the meeting either at Tarentum  
** or cape Japygia, and there convince them, that, be-  
"fore they enter the lists of war for the conquest of

« Sicily, they must fight for their passage across the

"Ionian ; — we should then strike them with the utmost

** terror, and infinitely perplex them with the thought  
** * that from a friendly port we shall sally forth to guard  
** our out-works, (for Tarentum will readily receive us,}  
** whilst they have a long tract of sea to pass with all  
** their cumbersome train, and must find it hard,

** the regular order.' As their course must thus be slow,'  
"and must advance only in exact conformity to orders,

"we shall have a thousand opportunities to attack them.

** If again they clear their ships for action, and in a

body bear down expeditiously upon us"* they must

** ply hard at their oars; and, when spent with their  
** toil, "we'can fall upon them. Or, in case that may  
** not be judged adviseable, we have it always in our  
"power to retire into the harbour of Tarentum. And

** thus the Athenians, if, in constant expectation of be-  
"ing fought with at sea they must make their passage

** with a small portion only of their stores, will be re-

duced to great distress on coasts, which will afford

** them no supply. Should they choose to continue in  
** their station, they must infallibly be blockedupin.it.  
"Should they venture a passage, they must unavoidably

** leave their tenders and storeships behind; and, as  
** they have no assurance of a hearty reception from the  
** cities on the coasts, must be terribly dismayed.
