82 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.V.

"who are under no manner of tie, and who were never

** indebted for their settlement to you, and those, who*  
** revolting from you, have been again reduced?"

Athenians.

"WHY should they not? They know such a sense

"of things may be well grounded in regard to both;

** inasmuch as those, who are exempted from our yoke,  
** owe such exemption to their own superior strength,  
** and, if we attack them not, it is the pure result or  
"fear. And hence, the reduction of you, besides iri-

larging our empire, will invest it with more ample se-

** curity; especially, when seated on an island, you are  
** bound to submit to the masters of the sea, and to re-  
"main henceforth too weak for resistance, unless you

** are victorious at the present crisis."

M E L I A N S.

"DO you then conclude that what we have proposed

** is incompatible with your own security ?^—For since,  
"excluding us from the plea of justice, you endeavour

"merely to persuade us in;o subserviency to your inte-

"rest, we also are again necessitated to insist once more

* ** on the -profitable to ourselves, and, by shewing that  
"with our welfare your own also coincideth, endea-

** vour to prevail. — What think you of all those States  
?* which now stand neutral, in your disputes? How will

** you avoid their implacable hatred, when, terrified at  
"such your usage of us, they mult live in constant expec-

V tation of your hostilities? And whither can such con-

"duct tend, but to enlarge the number of your decla-

_** red enemies, and to constrain others, who never de-

signed to be your foes, to take up arms against you,

** though to their own regfet ?•" *
