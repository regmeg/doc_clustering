»i8 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VIL

the horsemen, mounted guard by night. The latter, e-

'ver under arms without, the rest on the constant guard

of the city-walls, and this for a summer and winter

without any intermission, were reduced to a very low

condition. But the point which pressed hardest upon

them was having two wars at once upon their hands;

and yet their obstinacy had rose to so high a pitch, as,

had it not been visible to all the world, the bare men­

tion of its possibility would hare been quite incredible:

For who would have believed, that this people, fo

closely blocked up at home by the Peloponnesians,

should scorn to give up Sicily? nay, should persevere

with unabating zeal, to carry on the siege of Syracuse,

a city in no respect inserior even to Athens itself? that

they should exhibit such an astonishing proof of their

strength and their courage to the eyes of Greece; where,

upon the first breaking out of the war, some people had

imagined, that, in case the Peloponnefians invaded Atti­

ca, they could not hold out above one year intire,

though others had allowed them two, and others three,

but nobody a longer space? and that, in the seventeenth

year after the first invasion of this kind, they should at­

in every parr, by one war already upon their hands,

should wilfully plunge into another, as formidable in

all respects as that waged against them from Peloponne­

sus? But now, when, besides what they had suffered

already, they were terribly annoyed from Decelea, and

other incidents had exacted from them very large dis­

bursements, their finances were reduced to a very low

ebb. At this period, therefore, instead of the tribute

paid them by their dependents, they exacted a twentieth

of the value of all commodities imported and exported,

which they thought would replenish their cofsers faster

than the former method: For, their disbursements were

not as they had been in preceding times, but had been

inflamed in the fame proportion as the scenes of war had
