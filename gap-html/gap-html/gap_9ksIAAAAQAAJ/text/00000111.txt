JB.VIi THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR.

;, YEAR XVII.J

IN the succeeding summer, very early in the spring, the

Athenian embassadors returned from Sicily, accompa­

nied by the Egesteans. They brought sixty talents

of uncoined silver, being a month's pay for sixty fail

of ships, the equipment of which for succour they were

instructed to solicit from the Athenians. Upon this,

an assembly of the people was called, and the reports

ef the Egistean and their own embassadors were recei­

ved, consisting of many points, specious indeed, but

false in fact; and, so far as related to their treasure,

that ** sums ample enough are already reposited in their

** temples and their public treasury." In consequence  
of this, a decree was made, that " a fleet of sixty ships

"should sail for Sicily; the commanders, Alcibiades,

"the son of Clinias, Nicias, the son ot Niceratus, and

i^amachus, the son of Xenophanes, to be invested

*: with full powers to act at their own discretion. The

* Lamachus, the third in this commission, seems to have been picked out for the  
command for the peculiar constitution of his own character, which was a proper

ifieari bet*veen the cautious and phlegmatic disposition of Nicias and the
siery impetu­

ous ardour of Alcibiades. He was now (according to Plutarch] a brave old
experien­

ced officer. In his youth he had been rtm.rkable for heat and fire; a length
of ser­

vice and years had mellowed him into the right temper, to deliberate
beforehand, and

then gallantly to carry the point into execution. But then, he wanted the
means

of properly supporting the authority and dignity of His post. He was now
ranked

with two of the most wealthy and noble Athenians; whereas his own condition
was

low; nay, he was (according to Plutarch) so exceedingly poor, that, berore he
went

to any foreign command, he was used to petition the Slate for a little money
to fur-

nifli him out, and even to buy him some (hoes. Mr. Wofli, in his notes on
Thucy-

dides, refers' in for his character to a comedy of Aristophanes (The
Acbarniam) j

that is, to enquire after the character of a plain blunt officer from a
professed droll,

or to seek ttuih from him who ridiculed all mankind. Aristophanes hath
represent­

ed Lamachus as a vain-glorious roaring bully, a mere thing of arms, a creature
of ver­

bal p^mp and parade; contrary to all the truth of history. Writers, who live
by

turnirtg great ard good men into ridicule, should never be reckoned good
evidence as

to the truth and reality of characters, when history dissents.
