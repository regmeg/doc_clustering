B.V. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 71

Lichas, son of Arcesilaus, the public host of the Ar­

gives, accordingly arriveth at Argos, charged to make

two demands in the name of the Lacedæmonians: The

one, " whether war be still their option?" the other,

how? if their choice be peace." Upon this a strong

debate arose, for Alcibiades was present. But the par­

ty, who acted in the Lacedæmonian interest, prevailed

with the Argives to accept their proposals of an accom­

modation i which were as followeth:

** THUS resolved, by the Lacedæmonian council,  
** to compound with the Argives.

"These to restore their children to the Orchome-

"nians, and their men to the Mænalians; to restore

"also to the Lacedæmonians their citizens now detain-

"ed at Mantinea 5 to evacuate Epidaurus and demo-

"lish their works.'

"And the Athenians, if they will not quit Epidau-

v rus, to be declared enemies to the Argives and to the

V Lacedæmonians, and to the consederates of the La-

"cedæmonians and to the consederates of the Argives.

** And, if the Lacedæmonians have in their power  
* * any young men, to release them to all the States.

** In relation to the god, * we consent that an oath  
"be administered to the Epidaurians, and we grant

"the form to be prescribed by the Argives,

The States of Peloponnesus, both small and grear,

** to be, none excepted, free, according to their own  
** primitive constitutions.

** And, if any State without Peloponnesus shall .en­  
s* ter offensively into the lands of Peloponnesus, suc-

** cours to be united, in pursuance of a general consult

of Peloponnesians about the determinate and most

*' expedient methods.

tl All confederates of the Lacedæmonians whatever,

"without Peloponnesus, shall enjoy the same privileges

* The Pythian Apollo. This article seems designed to adjust the quarrel about  
the victim, related in the transactions of the last year.
