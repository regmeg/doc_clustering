THE

BOOK VII.

(JYLIPPUS and Pythen, when they had refitted

their ships, stood along the coast from Tarentum to

Locri Epizephyrii. Here they received more certain

information, that Syracuse was not yet completely in­

vested, and that a succour of force.might be thrown

into the town by the way of Epipolæ. They went next

to consultation, — whether, "keeping Sicily on the

** right, they should endeavour at all hazards to enter  
*' Syracuse by sea; or, with Sicily on their left, should  
*' steer first to Himera from whence, attended by  
"the forces of that State and whatever additional

"strength they could persuade to join them, they should

first to Himera, especially as the four Athenian vessels

were not yet arrived at Rhegium, which Nicias at last,

upon the certain intelligence that they were now at

gium and Messene, arrive at Himera: whilst, in the

latter place, they prevailed upon the Himereans to con­

cur with them in the war, and not only to entrust their

troops under their command, but even to supply with

arms such of the mariners as had navigated the vessels,

and were therefore unprovided; for, their shipping

they had drawn ashore, and laid up at Himera. The
