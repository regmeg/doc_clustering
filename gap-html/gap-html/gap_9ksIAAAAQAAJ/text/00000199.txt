B.VL THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 187

called Trogilus, near to the line marked out for the cir-

cumvallation, which was to reach, by the shortest com­

pass, from the great harbour on one side to the sea on

the other. But the Syracusans, who were principally

guided by the advice of Hermocrates, gave up all

thoughts of sallying out for the future, with the whole

strength of the city, to give battle to the Athenians.

It was judged more adviseable to run along a wall in

length, which should cut the line in which the Athenian

works were designed to pass, and which (could they ef­

fect it in time) mull entirely exclude the enemy from

persecting their circumvallation. "Nay, farther, in cafe

the enemy should come up in a body to interrupt the

'work, they might give them full employ with one divi­

sion of their force, whilst another party might raise pa-

lilades to secure the approaches; at least, as the whole

of the Athenian force must be drawn out to oppose

them, they would be obliged to discontinue their own

works. To raise, therefore, the projected work, they

issued out ot the city; and, beginning at the foot of the

city-wall from below the Athenian circle, they carried

on srom thence a transverse wall, cutting down the o-

live-trees in the sacred grove, of which they buiit wood­

was not yet come round from Thapsus into the great

harbour, but the Syracusans continued masters of all

the posts upon the sea, and consequently the Athenians

'were obliged to fetch up all necessary stores from Thap­

sus across the land,

When it appeared to the Syracusans that all their

palisades and the transverse-wall were sufficiently com­

pleted, in which the Athenians had given them no

manner of interruption, as they were under apprehen­

sions that, should they divide their force, they might

be exposed to a defeat, and at the same time were ar­

dently intent on perfecting their own circumvallation;—

the Syracusans drew off again into the city, leaving only
