B. VI. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 107

"tacked me;â€”-and I also judge myself deserving of the

** trust. In regard to those things which have caused  
"me to be so loudly censured; those very things give

"splendor to my ancestors and to myself, and are of

"public emolument also to my country. The great

"magnisicence I displayed at the Olympic solemnities
