240 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR/ B.VII.

Eurymedon then declared that his sense of things co­

incided with that of Demosthenes; and, Nicias persist­

ing in the contrary opinion, a sit of languor and sus-

pence ensued, attended with the secret imagination that

the pofitiveness of Nicias resulted from some stronger

hopes of success he had conceived above his colleagues.

And in this manner the Athenians fell into dilatory mea­

sures, and continued in their camp before Syracuse.

But in this interval Gylippus and Sicanos returned

to Syracuse: Sicanus, truly, disappointed of Agrigen-

tum, for he was advanced no farther than Gela when

the sedition in favour of the Syracusans was brought to

passage of two days and a night. Hence therefore they

stood across, and landed at Selinus. . . ,

and sea. But the Athenian generals,—finding they had

received so large an augmentation, and that the posture

of their own affairs was so far from being changed for

the better that day after day it grew worse in every re­

spect, and, what was worst of all, that their troops were

quite exhausted with fatigue and sickness, — they repent­

ed now in earnest that they had not drawn off in time;

and, as Nicias now no longer opposed that step with the

same vehemence as he had done before, but merely en­
