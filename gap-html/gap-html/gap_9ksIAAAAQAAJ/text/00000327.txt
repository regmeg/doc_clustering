compassed them round on all sides. Then, taking to

open flight, they lost six of their ships; but with the

remainder reach in safety the iste of Teuglussa, and

from thence proceed to Halicarnassus.

This being done, the Peloponnesians, putting back

to Cnidus,, and the twenty-seven fail from Caunus com­

dus.

"it would be, should the king now claim, upon that

pretext* the possession of that tract ofcountry of which,

**• either he or his ancestors had formerly, been masters:  
"For thus he might be enabled once more to inflave

"of freeing, would be obliged to impose the Median
