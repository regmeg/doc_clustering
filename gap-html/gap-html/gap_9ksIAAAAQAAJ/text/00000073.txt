B-V. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 6,t

with such Arcadian parties as were already come up,

marched on and broke into the Mantinean; and, having

formed their camp near the temple of Hercules, they

ravaged the country.

The Argives and their allies, when their enemy was

thus in sight, having posted themselves on a spot of

ground by nature strong and difficult of approach, drew

up in order, as ready to engage. The Lacedæmoni­

ans also immediately advanced towards them, and even

approached so near as within the cast of a stone or a dart.

But qne of the old experienced Spartans, perceiving that

what it meant. At length, when the enemy was totally

concerning their enemies, " How many are they?" but " Where are they?" And

that, when he was hindered from righting at Mantinea, he said, "They, who

"would rule over many, must fight against many:" And, being asked what was the
