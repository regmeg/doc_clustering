turned the popular government. At length, with great

difficulty, being quieted, they gave them a hearing.

The deputies remonstrated, that " not for the ruin

"of Athens was this new change introduced, but

"purely for its preservation — in no wise to betray it

"into the hands of the enemy ; because that might

by reprimanding those whose private resentments burst

out most violently against the deputies, prevented mis­

chief. At length, he himself dismissed them, with the

following answer. — That " the administration in the

"hands of five-thousand he had no intention to oppose:

** But he ordered them to give an immediate discharge  
"to the four-hundreds and to restore the council of

"five-hundred to their prior state. If, farther, from a
