fc.V. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. i$

expofing himself, as little as possible, to the uncertain­

ties of fortune; and vacuity from danger was compatible

solely with peace. Pleistionax had been calumniated by

his enemies on the account of his restoration; and they

invidiously suggested to his prejudice, upon every loss
