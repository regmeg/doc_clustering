B.VI. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 133

** But, if not one tittle of these intended invasions be true,  
"which is my firm opinion, the State will not be struck

** into a panic by your rumours, will never place the  
** command of her forces in your hands, so as to rivet  
"a voluntary servitude upon herself. She, on the con-

"trary, will exert her own vigilance and discretion j she

"will interpret the rumours you have spread as so many

delivering himself thus":

*c individual and this community may be timely prepa-  
** red to repel the invaders. Andj if this should prove  
** at last to be mere superfluity of care, yet what harm  
** can possibly accrue from such an equipment of the  
"State with horses, and arms, and such other habili-

** ments as are the glory of war? We ourselves shall  
** take all proper care os the provisions of war and the  
** levy of soldiers j and at the fame time shall circulate  
"our messengers to the cities around us, and to watch

** the appearance of the foe; and shall expedite every  
** point judged needful in the present emergence Some  
** care of these points hath already been taken, and,  
** what more we shall perceive to be expedient, we shall
