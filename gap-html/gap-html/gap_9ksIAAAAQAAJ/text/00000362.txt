3so THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VIII.

the universe. Nay, they were ready this very moment,

upon the strength of what Alcibiades had said, to flight

the enemy now at hand, and steer directly for the Pi­

ræus. But, though numbers with vehemence recom­

mended the step, he stopped their ardour by remon­

strances, that " they ought by no means to think of

"steering for the Piræus, and leave their nearer ene-

"mies upon their backs: But, in relation to the ope-

*' rations of war, since he was elected a general, (he  
"said,) he would first go and confer with Tissaphernes,

the assembly was no sooner dissolved than he immedi­

ately departed, that he might appear in all respects to

be perfectly united with Tissaphernes ; desirous also to

raise himself in his esteem, and give him a sensible proof

that he was appointed a general; and, by virtue of this,

enabled either to do him service or to do him harm.

It was the peculiar fortune of Alcibiades to awe the

Athenians by Tissaphernes, and Tissaphernes by the

Athenians.

The Peloponnesians at Miletus had no sooner heard

of the recal of Alcibiades, than, as before they suspected

treachery in Tissaphernes, they, now loudly vented in­

vectives against him. What more inflamed them was,

that, ever since the Athenians shewed themselves before

Miletus and they had refused to put out to sea and en­

gage them, Tissaphernes had flackened more than ever

in his payments; and thus, hated by them for that

reason sufficiently before, he now became more odious

on account of Alcibiades. The soldiery again, as on

former occasions, ran together in parties, and enume­

rated their grievances. Nay, some of higher ranks,

persons of real importance, and not merely the private

men, were full of remonstrances, that ** they had at

*' no time received their full subsistence; his payments  
u had been always scanty, and even those had never

*' been regular: In snort, unless they were led di-  
*' rectly against the enemy, or carried to some other

and would then proceed to action.
