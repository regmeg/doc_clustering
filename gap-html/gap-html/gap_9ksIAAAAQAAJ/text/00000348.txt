few, as it kept alive that mutual distrust which reigned

among the people.

Pisander, therefore, and his associates, arriving at

this very juncture, gave the finishing stroke without de­

lay. In the first place, having called an assembly of the

people, they moved for a decree, —" That a commit-

bring him into any trouble whatever.

serve or ambiguity, moved, — That *' no magistrate

** establishment, nor receive a public salary; but that  
** five f presidents be chosen, who should choose one  
** hundred persons, and each of these hundred should  
*' name three persons for associates: That these per-  
** sons should enter into the senate, be invested abso-  
** lutely with the administration, and should farther be  
*' impowered to convene the five thousand whenever  
*' they should deem it proper."

Pisander was the person who made this proposal, and

who also in other respects shewed himself openly one

of the most zealous to pull down the democracy. But

steps the affair should be thus carried into execution,
