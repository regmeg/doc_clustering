B.VI. THE PELOPOtfNESIAN WAR. fft

*' Because every hostile force is always most terrible on  
"its first approach; and, in case it protract- tlve time of

"encountering the eyes of its foes, they twist recover

"their courage through familiarity with danger, and

"then the sight of an enemy is more apt to inspire

»' contempt: — But, should they assault them on a sud-

"den whilst yet their approach is with terror expected,

** the victory must insallibly be their own: — In this  
"cafe, all things would co-operate with them to terrify

"the foe; such as, the sight of their numbers, which

"now only could appear in their greatest inlargement;

*' the forebodings of their heaits what miseries were like  
"to ensue; andj above all, the instant necessity they

*' must lie under of hazarding a battle: Thar, moreover,  
"it was likely* that numbers of the enemy might be"

"surprised yet roaming abroad in the adjacent country,

'* as still they were incredulous of the approach of the

*' Athenians: Or, even though the Syracusans were safely  
*' retired with all their effects into the city, the army  
*' must needs become masters of prodigious wealth, if  
** they should besiege the city and awe all around it:  
*' That, by taking this step, the other Sicilians would be  
"more discouraged from succouring the Syracusans,

"and more easily inclined to concur with the Athenians,

"and all shifts and delays to keep clear of the contest,

** till one side was manifestly superior, would be pre-  
"eluded." He added farther, that "they should take

"care to possess themselves of Megara, which was now

** deserted and not far from Syracuse either by sea or  
** land, as it would afford a fine station for their ships-  
*' to lie in, would shelter them upon a retreat, and give  
"expedition to their approaches."

But, though Lamachus delivered his sentiments thus, he

soon gave up his own opinion and went over to that of

Alcibiades. And, in pursuance of this, Alcibiades with

his own single ship passed over to Mesiene; and, having

gained a conserence with the Mesienians about an alliance

offensive and defensive, when no arguments he broughe
