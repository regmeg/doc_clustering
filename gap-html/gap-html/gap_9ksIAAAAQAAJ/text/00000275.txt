B. VII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 263

But the Athenians, quite funk with the weight

of their present misfortunes, never so much as once en­

tertained the- thought of recovering their mattered ves­

sels Or their dead, but were contriving how to decamp

by favour of the approaching night. Demosthenes,

upon this, repairing to Nicias, declared it as his own

Opinion, that, " manning at once the whole number

** of their vessels, they mould exert their utmost efforts  
M to force their passage out of the harbour early the

were sensible, as much as he who gave this advice, how

reasonable it was, and declared themselves forks execu­
