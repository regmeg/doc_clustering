ao6 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VII.

*' must either be recalled, or be reinforced with a body

not inferior to the first equipment, with both a land

"For myself, I must insist that a successor be sent me;

"since I am quite disabled, by a nephritic disorder,

rymedon the son of Thucles. Eurymedon, by order,

began his passage for Sicily about the winter-solstice, at
