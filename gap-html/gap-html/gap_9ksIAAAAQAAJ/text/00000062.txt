50 THE PEtOPONNESIAN WAR. B.V,

Mantineans, a thousand of each, and a party of Athe­

nian horse who were at Argos in readiness to attend the

festival. But a great consternation had seized the whole

assembly of united Greece, lest the Lacedæmonians

should return with an armed force; more especially,

when Lichas, the son of Archesilaus, a Lacedæmonian,

was scourged in the course by the under-osficers, be­

cause, when his chariot had gained the prize, and the

chariot of the Bœotian State was proclaimed victor,

pursuant to the exclusion of the Lacedæmonians srom

the race, he stepped into the midst of the assembly, and

crowned the charioteer, desirous to make it known

that the chariot belonged to him. Upon this, the

whole assembly was more than ever alarmed, and it was

fully expected that some strange event would follow:

The Lacedæmonians, however, made no bustle > and

the festival passed regularly through its train.

After the Olympics, the Argives and their consede­

rates repaired to Corinth, in order to solicit the concur­

rence of that State. A Lacedæmonian embassy hap­

pened also to be there. Many conserences were held,

and nothing finally determined; but, upon feeling the

shock of an earthquake, they parted each to their re­

spective cities. And here the summer ended.

In the ensuing winter, a battle was fought, by the

Haracleots of Trachis, against the Ænianians, and Do-

lopians, and Meliensians, and some of the Thessalians.

For the bordering nations were enemies to the city

of Heraclea, as this latter place had been fortified for

their more especial annoyance. From its foundation

they had ever opposed it, preventing its growth to the

utmost of their power; and at this time they deseated the

Heracleots in a battle, in which Xenares, the son of Cni-

dis, the Lacedæmonian commandant, was stain; a

number also of the Heracleots perished. And thus the

winter ended: and the twelfth year of the war came al­

so to an end.
