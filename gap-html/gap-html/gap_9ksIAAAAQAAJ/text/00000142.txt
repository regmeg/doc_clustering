i3o THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B. VI.

*' a total destruction. And what therefore, in all human  
*' probability, must be their fate, when all Sicily to a  
*' man will' be combined to oppose them? For now  
f' their war must issue from a camp on the beach of the

sea, of which their ships must form the ramparts.

M They will not be able to make long excursions from

"their tents and magazines of needful stores^ as our

"cavalry will bridle and controul them. But, in short,

*1 it is my firm opinion that they never will be able to  
*' accomplish a descent, so far am I convinced that our

"To guard the present times from such disastrous
