56 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. E.V.

gives should march into the plain to make head against

the Lacedæmonians, the last wuh their cavalry might

press upon their rear.

After these dispositions, and such a descent into the

plain, Agis ravaged Saminthusand other places; upon

intelligence of which, the Argives, so soon as it was

day, dislodged from Nemea to stop the depredations,

and on their march met with the body of Phiiasians and

Corinthians; and, encountering, flew some few of the

Phiiasians, whilst not a much greater number of their

own men were destroyed by the Corinthians. The Bœ­

otians also, and Megareans, and Sicyonians, took the

route of Nemea conformably to orders, and found the

Argives already dislodged; but the latter, upon enter­

their lands, drew up in order of battle. The Lacedæ­

monians stood regularly drawn up on the other side.

And now the Argives were shut up in the middle of their

enemies: For, on the side of the plain, the Lacedæ­

monians, and those in their body, intercepted their re­

turn to the city; on the high ground above them were

the Corinthians, and Phiiasians, and Pellenians; on the

other part, towards Nemea, were the Bœotians, and

Sicyonians, and Megareans. Cavalry they had none:

For the Athenians were the only part of their confede­

racy who were not yet come up. •

The bulk, indeed, of the Argives and confederates

apprehended not the danger, which at present environ­

ed them, to be so great; but rather concluded they

might engage with advantage, and that they had caught

the Lacedæmonians fast within their territory, and near

to Argos itself. Two Argives, however, Thrasyl-

lus, one of the five in command, and Alciphron, the

public host of the Lacedæmonians, the very instant

the armies were moving to the charge, had addresied

themselves to Agis, and proposed expedients to pre­

vent a battle; giving their word, that "the Argives
