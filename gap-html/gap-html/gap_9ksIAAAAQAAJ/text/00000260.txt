248 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B. VII.

than the rancour they bore the Lacedæmonians, and

the gratification of private spleen, though Doric, yet

followed the Ionic Athenians against their Doric kin­

dred. But the Mantineans and the reft of the Arca­

dians, who are mercenaries, and eternally habituated to

act against any foe pointed out to them, were now so far

influenced by gain as to regard those Arcadians as their

enemies who came over on this occasion in company with

the Corinthians. The Cretans also and Ætolians were

there, allured by an advantageous pay; and thus it

happened that the Cretans, who, in concert with the

Rhodians, had founded Gela, readily took part, for

the fake of gain, not with but against a colony which

themselves had planted. There was also a body of A-

carnanian auxiliaries, partly induced to join by the pay

they received, but principally by their personal regard

Tyrrhenes, from enmity to the Syracusans, and the

mercenary Iapygians. So many nations were assembled

together at present under command of the Athenians.

The auxiliaries, on the side of the Syracusans, were

the Camarineans, who border close upon them, and the

Geloans, who are situated next the Camarineans. To

proceed regularly: As the Agrigentines were neutral,

the Selinuntians next occur, who are seated beyond the

Agrigentines, since they inhabit that tract of the island

which faceth Afric. Then the Himereans, the only

Grecian people who inhabit that part of the ifland

which lies off the Tyrrhene sea, and were the only body

which came from thence to the aid of Syracuse. The
