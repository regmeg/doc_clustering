B.VIII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 361

patrole assigned for Munichia; and, what was of most

importance, it was openly countenanced by the whole

body of the heavy-armed. The news of it was imme­

diately carried to the four hundred, who were this mo­

ment assembled together in council; and all, except­

ing those dissatisfied with their measures, were ready to

run to arms, and vented terrible threats against Thera-

menes and his associates.

But he, apologizing for himself, declared his readi­

ness to take up arms along with them, and attend them

to the rescue of Alexicles; and, taking with him one

of the generals who was in his secret, he hurried down

to the Piræus. Aristarchus also ran down to assist; as

did, farther, the young men belonging to the cavalry

of the State.

Great, in truth, was the tumult, and full of horror:

For those who were left in the upper-city imagined that

the Piræus was already seized, and that Alexicles was

/lain; and they in the Piræus each moment expected an

assault from those in the city. Not without difficulty

could the men of years and experience stop such as were

wildly running up and down the streets, and rushing

to arms. And Thucydides, the Pharsalian, public host

of the State, who happened then to be at Athens, threw

himself with lively zeal in the way ot all who were flock­

ing down; conjuring them earnestly " not to finish

f' the ruin of their country, when the enemy lay so

"near to strike the blow." But thus, at length, their

fury abated, and the effusion of one another's blood was

prevented.

As for Theramenes, he was no sooner got down to

the Piræus, than, assuming authority, (for he himself

was at this time a general,) he pretended to rate the

heavy-armed for this piece of mutiny, at least so far as

mere making a noise could do it; whilst Aristarchus and

all the opposite faction were angry with them in earnest.

But the bulk of the heavy-armed drew together in a

body, and betray no sign of regret for what they had

done.
