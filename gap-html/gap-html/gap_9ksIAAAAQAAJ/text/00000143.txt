B.VI. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 131

** if favoured with your concurrence, my care mall be  
"successful. To this end I must prevail upon you,

"who are the many, to co-operate with me, whilst I

"inflict, upon these artificers of faction, the punishment

"they deserve, not barely for overt commissions, (fog
