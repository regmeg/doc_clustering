224 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VII.

together composed the center of their arrangement, and

Polyanthes, the Corinthian, commanded the fleet.

The Athenians, with three and thirty sail, under the

command of Diphilus, weighed from Naupactus, and

stood in against them. At first, the Corinthians lay

still without motion; but, so soon as it was judged ne­

cessary for them to act, and the signal-flag was accord­

ingly hoisted, they advanced to charge the Athenians,

and an engagement ensued. The contention was main­

rinthian vessels are destroyed, whilst not a single ship on

the Athenian side was funk, though seven were disabled

for service by blows they had received from the ene­

mies beaks, by which their forecastles had been shat­

for this very purpose by stays on each side of the beak.

The event of the engagement remaining doubtful,

from whence both sides took occasion to claim the vic­

shatters of the enemy's fleet, which the wind drove

right into the sea, and which the Corinthians made no

efforts to recover, they dropped away from each other.

Yet no kind of pursuit was attempted, and no prisoners

were taken by either: for the Corinthians and Pelo-

ponnesians, who fought close under the shore, were by

that enabled to make an easy escape; but, on the Athe­

nian side, not even a single ship was funk. And yet,

when the Athenians were sailed back to Naupactus, the

Corinthians immediately set up a trophy, as if the vic­

tory was their own, because they had disabled a larger

number of the enemy. They farther looked upon

themselves as not defeated, because their enemies were

not clearly victorious: for it is the way with the Corin­

thians to pronounce themselves victors if they are not

ladly beaten; whereas the Athenians esteem themselves

defeated if they have not made a signal conquest. But,

farther, when the Peloponnesians were retired from

their station, and the land-army was dismissed, the A-
