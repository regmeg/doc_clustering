25.6 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B. VlL

"that we are really the best, since we have beat the

"best, seamen in the world, our hopes of success are

"in every light redoubled; and then human experience

** teacheth us, that, in every competition, the warmest  
"hope is ever accompanied with the greatest resolu-

"tion.

"But farther, those late alterations which they have

"introduced among their shipping, in order to equalise

** and balance ours, have been a long time familiar to  
"our own practice; and each of their new preparations

"we shall dexterously improve to our own advantage:

"For when, contrary to the long and inveterate disci-

** pline of their fleet, there are crouded together upon  
"their decks a numerous body of heavy-armed, as well

** as another numerous body of mere terra firma dart-  
"ers, as they may properly bestiled, — when thus A-

carnanians and other landmen are forced on-board,

** who even sitting would be unable to poise and direct  
** their weapons,—how can they avoid indangering their  
** vessels? or, jumbled confusedly together, and tot-  
"tering under motions to which they are not inured,

"how can they escape a total disorder?

"What still makes more against them, the multi-

** tude of their shipping will only serve the more to  
"embarrass them,; and let this dispel the fears of those

"who may be afraid of engaging against their superior

** numbers; for a multitude ot ships in a contracted  
"space will be more stow in executing orders, and are

** at the fame time most easily exposed to the annoy-  
** ance which our preparations are contrived to give  
"them. And now attend to the true and real situation

** of the foe, as from good intelligence we are enabled  
"clearly to declare it to you.

"Environed on all sides with misfortunes, and dif-

"tressed in a present want of the necessaries of life, they

"are become quite desperate: And hence, though

"they have resigned all considence in their real

"strength, yet in the fury of despair they are throwing

"themselves
