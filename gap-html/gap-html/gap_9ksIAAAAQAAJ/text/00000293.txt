THE

PELOPONNESIAN WAR.

BOOK VIII.

W HEN the news was reported at Athens, no be­

lief tor a long time was given, — even though the most

creditable part of the soldiery, who had made their es­

cape from this disastrous business, proved it by a cir­

cumstantial relation, — that so total a destruction was

become their lot. But no sooner were they convinced

of its *reality, than their resentments burst forth against

those of the orators who had advised and recommended

the expedition, as if their own suffrages had never con­

curred to its execution. They farther vented their gall

against those retailers of oracles and foretellers of future

events, against all in general, who, pretending privity

* P.'utarcb, from report, tells an odd story on this occasion.—" A stranger, wh*  
"(it seems) had come ashore at the Piræus, and had set him down in a bar-

"ber's /hop, began to talk about the overthrow in Sicily, as of a point well

"known at Athens. The barber, hearing it before any other person had the

*' news, ran with all speed up into the city; and, having first informed the  
"magistrates of it, spread the report in an instant all over the forum.
Consterna-

"tion and tumult at once ensued. The magistrates convened an assembly of the

'' people, and produced the barber before them. He was called upon to tell
from

"whom he had the news; and, when he could not name the person, being looked

— upon as an idle fellow and a disturber of the public peace, he was
immediately

*' tied upon the wheel, and a long time whirled round upon it, till several per-  
'* sons arrived who gave a minute and circumstantial account of the whole."
