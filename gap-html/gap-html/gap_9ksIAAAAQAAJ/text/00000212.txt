200 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VII.

It was the opinion of Nicias, and in general of all

the Athenians, that, " though.it was not their own in-

** terest to bring on an engagement, yet it highly con-  
"cerned them to put a stop to the counterwork which

"the enemy was raising to hinder their progress:" For,

by this time, the wall of the Syracusans had only not

over-reached the extreme point to which the Athenians

had brought their circumvallation: " And, should it

gained this great point, that they could no longer be

invested on all sides by the Athenians; and the latter,

though masters in the field, were henceforwaids effectu­

ally stopped srom perfecting their circumvallation.

After this, twelve (hips of the Corinthians, and Am-

bracicts, and Leucadians, the remainder of the squa­

dron designed for this service, having given the Athe­
