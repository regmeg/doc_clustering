fe.V. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 6y

far overreached them, sent orders to the Skiritæ arid

Brasideans to wheel away from the spot where they were

first posted, and fill up the extremity of the line, so as

to render it equal to the Mantineans; and, to supply

the void thus made, he ordered, from the right wing,

two battalions, commanded by general-officers, Hippo-

no'idas and Aristocles, to repair thither, and, salling in*

to close up the ranks; judging, that their own right

would still be more than sufficient to execute their parts*

and the wing opposed to the Mantineans might, by this

disposition, be properly strengthened. But, as he issu­

it happened that Aristocles and Hipponoi'das absolutely

refused to change their post (though for such disobedi­

afterwards banished from Sparta); and, before the new

disposition could be completed, the enemy had begun

to charge. Upon the refusal of these two battalions to

change their post, Agis countermanded those marching

to strengthen the Skiritæ to their former places, who

now were unable to fall into the ranks, or close together

with those whom they had quitted: But, on this occa­

though irr all respects outdone in the military art, gave

signal proofs of their superiority in true manly valour.

For, to come to particulars, when once they were at

blows with the enemy, the right wing of the Mantineans

routs their Skiritæ and Brasideans. Then the same

Mantineans, supported by their confederates and the

thousand picked Argives, falling in at the void in the

Lacedæmonian line, which was not yet filled up, did

great execution upon them; for, taking them in flank,

they intirely broke them, drove them for shelter among

their carriages* and made a slaughter of the old men

who were appointed for their guard. And in this quar­

ter the Lacedæmonians were clearly vanquished.

But in the other quarters, and especially in the cen­

ter, where Agis, the king, was posted, and round him
