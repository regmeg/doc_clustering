B.VI. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. i7r

"as you know, that over our dependents in Greece

"we either hold tight or slacken the rein, as squares best

** with the public service. We permit to the Chians  
** and Methymneans the free use of their liberties and  
** laws for a quota of shipping; we do the same  
** to many for an annual tribute, exacted perhaps  
** with somewhat of rigour. Others amongst them,  
"who fight under our orders, are absolutely free,

** though seated upon islands and easy to be totally re-  
** duced, because they are commodiously situated to an-  
"noy the Peloponnesian coast. And hence it may be

* * depended upon, that we shall make such dispositions  
*'• allo here as are most expedient for our own interest,  
"and may best lessen the dread, which, as was said be-

** fore, we entertain of the Syracusans.

"The point at which they aim is an extent of their

** rule over you; and when, by alarming your suspicions  
** of us, they have wrought you to their own purpose,  
"either by open force or taking advantage of your de-

** solate condition, when we are repulsed and obliged  
1* to abandon your desence, they intend to subdue all

** Sicily to their yoke. Such the event will unavoidably  
** prove, if at present you adhere to them: For, never  
"again will it be easy for us to assemble together so

** large an armament to give a check to their ambition j  
** nor, when we are no longer at hand for your support,  
** will their strength against you be insufficient. It is  
•* vain in any man to indulge an opinion that this may

*s not be the cafe, since the very train of things evin-  
** ceth its truth. For, when first you invited us hither,  
** it was not upon the suggestion of any other fear than  
** this, that, should we suffer you to be subjected by the  
*f Syracusans, the danger then would extend itself to  
** us. And highly unjust it would be now, if the argu-  
** ment you luccessfully inforced with us should lose all its  
** influence upon you, or should you ground suspicions  
"on our present appearance against them with a force

.** superior to theirs, when you ought much more to en-
