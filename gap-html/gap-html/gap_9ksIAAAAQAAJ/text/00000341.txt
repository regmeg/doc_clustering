B. VIII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 329

or, necessitated to engage with the Athenians, should

susfer a defeat, or should the mariners quit their vessels,

the, Athenians then would carry their point without

thanks to him j but his greatest fear was this, lest for

the fake of subsistence they should ravage the continent.

Upon all these considerations, and the prudential mo­

tives arising from each, co-operating with his principal

maxim of balancing the Grecians against one another,

he sent for the Peloponnesians, pays them their arrears of

subsistence, and makes the following treaty, the third

of the kind, with them:

"IN the thirteenth year of the reign of Darius, A-

"lexippidas presiding in the college of Ephori at Lace-

*^ dæmon, articles are signed, in the plain of Mæan-  
"der, between the Lacedæmonians and consederates

"on one side; and Tissaphernes, Hieramenes, and the

"sons of Pharnacus, on the other; concerning the af-

** fairs of the king and those of the Lacedæmonians and  
** confederates.

"The whole of the king's dominions situate in Asia

"belongeth to the king; and all his own dominions let

** the king govern as to him seemeth meet. -

** The Lacedæmonians and confederates are not to  
** enter the dominions of the king to commit any act  
"of hostility whatever: Nor he those of the contract-

** ing parties for any act of hostility whatever.

"And, in case any of the Lacedæmonians or confe-

M derates enter in a hostile manner the dominions of the

** king, the Lacedæmonians and consederates are bound

to restrain them: And, in case any subjects of the

'* king act in a hostile manner against the Lacedæmo-

** nians and confederates, be the king also bound to re-  
** strain them.

"Tissaphernes shall pay subsistence to the ships now

** upon the station, according to the rates agreed on,  
** till the king's fleet come up.
