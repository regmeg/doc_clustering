&V. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. sr

YEAR XIII. J

THE succeeding summer was no sooner begun, than

the Bœotians, viewing the low estate to which it had

been reduced by the late battle, took into their own

hands the city of Heraclea, and discharged Hegesippi-

das, the Lacedæmonian commandant, as guilty of mal­

administration. They took this city into their own

hands, from the apprehension that, during the em­

broilments of the Lacedæmonians in Peloponnesus, the

Athenians might seize it. The Lacedæmonians, howe­

ver, were chagrined at this step of the Bœotians.

This fame summer also, Alcibiades, the son of Cli-

nias, being general of the Athenians, with the concur­

rence of the Argives and their allies, entered Pelopon­

nesus with a small party of heavy-armed Athenians and

archers, and enlarged his forces upon his route by the

aids of the confederates in those quarters j where he not

only made such a disposition of asfairs as might best an­

swer the views of the alliarrce, but also, traversing Pe­

loponnesus with his force, he both persuaded the Pa-

treans to continue their works quite down to the sea

and intended also to execute a plan of his own for erec­

ting a fort upon the Rhium of Achaia. -f But the Co­

rinthians, and Sicyonians, and all such as were alarmed

at the annoyance this fort might give them, rushed out

to prevent him, and obliged him to desist.

The same summer a war broke out between the Epi-

daurians and the Argives. The pretext was grounded

on a victim due from the Epidaurians to the'Pythian

Apollo, as an acknowledgement for their pastures; for

J Before Christ 419.

•f This was a graed project indeed! It aimed at no less than the total ruin of
Co­

rinth, and putting an end to all the navigation of that trading and opulent
city

through the hay of Crisla, The Athenians were already intire masters of the
sea on

the other side of the isthmus.
