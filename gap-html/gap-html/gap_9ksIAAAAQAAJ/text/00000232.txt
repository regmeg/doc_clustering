*20 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VII.

was exemplified in act: They even sell upon the public

school, which was a very large one, when the youth

of the town were but just got in, and hacked all the

children to pieces. And thus this whole city was invol­

ved in a calamity, a greater than which no city had ever

felt nay, a calamity unexpected and dreadful indeed!

The Thebans had no fooner intelligence of it, than they

marched to their assistance; but came not up with the

Thracians till they were retired to some distance from

the town, where they recovered from them their booty,

and, having put them to flight, continue the chace

down to the Euripus and the sea, where the vessels

which had brought them lay at anchor. Here they

make a staughter of most of those who endeavoured to

get on-board, but could not swim; since the persons left

in the vessels, when they law what passed on the shore,

put them off beyond their reach. But, in the otherparts

of the retreat, the Thracians behaved with some gal­

lantry against the Theban horse, which attacked them

first since, sallying frequently out on the pursuers, and

rallying again after the discipline of their country, they

made good their retreat; and thus few of this body were

destroyed. A number, farther, who staid behind in the

city to plunder, were found there and put to the

sword. The whole number of the slain, amongst this

body of thirteen hundred Thracians, amounted to two

hundred and fifty men; though, in return, they killed,

of Thebans, and others who accompanied by way of aid,

of horse and heavy-armed together, about twenty, and

Skirphondas of Thebes, one of the rulers of Bœotia;

the lives of some more Mycalessians were also lost in

their company. Such was the calamity which fell to

the unhappy lot of Mycalesius; and which, for excess

of horror, is more to be deplored than any other of the

tragical events of this war.
