B.VI. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 129

"But you, Syracusans, I exhort, to apply your good

"sense on this occasion, and search after probability;

"not by considering such accounts as these men have

pompousiy detailed, but such enterprises as a wise and

4t abundantly-enlightened people (for such I esteem the

"Athenians) are likely to undertake. For, whatpro-

"babilky is there, that, leaving the Peloponnesians on

** their backs, when the war at home is not yet brought  
** to any settled conclusion, they would wilfully embark  
** into another of no less importance? For my part,  
** I am persuaded they rest well contented, that, so  
"many and so powerful States as we Sicilians are, we

** have not yet thought proper to invade them.

** But, allowing these informations true, and that  
** they are actually coming, — I am firmly persua-  
** ded, that Sicily is better able than Poloponnefus to  
** war them down, by how much in all respects it is  
<l better furnished with every resource of war; and

** that this our Syracuse alone is far superior in strength  
** to that, nay double that armament, which by report  
** now threatens its invasion. For I know, assuredly,  
** that no horse can follow in their train; that, farther,  
** none can be procured for them in this country, if we

abate an inconsiderable party which the Egesteans

** may furnish. And I know, that a body of heavy-  
** armed, equal in number to our own, can never be  
'* transported by them across such a length of sea.

-** The enterprize is bold indeed, to attempt so long a  
** voyage hither with only light and nimble ships, and to

bring all those military stores, the roll of which mult

** be excessively large, in order to attack so great a city.  
'** Shall I therefore be terrified at vain reports? I, who

am firmly persuaded, that, if the Athenians were

** possessed of a city on our coasts as considerable in all  
"respects as Syracuse itself, and should dare to pro-

** voke us; if masters of the neighbouring territory,  
** they should from thence make war upon us; — even  
• f * with such advantages they would with difficulty escape
