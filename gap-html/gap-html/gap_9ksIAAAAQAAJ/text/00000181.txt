B.VI. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 169

** been glad to invelope us. Thus solid are the  
** grounds on which we found our title to that extensive  
** rule we now enjoy. We honestly deserve it: Since,  
"in the cause of Greece, we equipped the largest fleet,

*' and exerted the greatest ardour, without the least e-  
** quivocation; and since those others, acting with im-  
** plicit obedience to the Mede, did all they could to  
4* distress us. To which let it be added, that we were

** at the fame time desirous to obtain a strength suffi-  
** cient to give a check to the ambition of Peloponne-  
** sians. Submissive, therefore, to their dictates, we are  
** not, will not be because, either in return for the  
** repulse of the barbarian by our single efforts, or in  
** requital of the dangers we bravely encountered in de-

** fence of the liberty of those Ionians, greater than

** all the rest of Greece, or even they themselves, durst  
** hazard for their own, . we have an undoubted  
** right to empire.

** But, farther, to guard its own liberties and rights  
** is a privilege, which, without either murmur or en-  
** vy, will be allowed to every State: And now, for  
** the security of these important points to ourselves,  
** have we ventured hither to beg your concurrence;  
** conscious, at the fame time, ye inen of Camarina,  
** that your welfare too coincides with our own. This  
** we can clearly demonstrate, even from those crimina-  
** tions which our adversaries here have lavished upon  
** us, and from those so terrible suspicions which you  
** yourselves are inclined to entertain of our proceed-  
4* ings. We are not now to learn, that men, who

** with some high degrees of horror suspect latent mis-  
** chief, may for the present be soothed by an insinua-  
** ting flow of words; but, when summoned to action,  
** will so exert themselves as is expedient for their wel-  
** fare: And, consonant to this, we have already hint*  
** ed that through fear alone we seized that power  
** which we now possess in Greece; that through the  
Â« fame motive we have ventured hither, to establish our

"own
