3i6 THE PELOPOMNESIAN WAR. B.VIII.

** subjection on, the Grecians. He insisted, therefore,  
** that a better treaty should be made, or at least the  
** former (hould be instantly disannulled; for on terms  
** like the present they would scorn to take pay from  
** the king." Nettled at this, Tissaphernes went from  
them in a fit of choler, without bringing affairs to any

kind of settlement.

The scheme now next in agitation was a voyage to

Rhodes, which the most powerful persons there had by

embassies solicited them to undertake. They were full

of hopes to bring into their subjection an island by no

means inconsiderable either for number of mariners or

soldiers; and at the fame time judged themselves able,

by their present alliances, to defray the expence of their

fleet without requesting pay from Tiflaphemes. Ac­

cordingly, this winter, with great dispatch, they put to

sea from Cnidus; and, arriving first at Camirus, on

the Rhodian coast, with ninety-four ships, they struck

a consternation into the multitude, who knew nothing

of past transactions, and were the sooner tempted to a-

bandon their dwellings as the city was not guarded by

the least fortification. The Lacedæmonians, after­

wards, summoning to a conference these, and the Rho-

dians also from two other cities, Lindus and lelysus,

persuaded them to revolt from the Athenians. Rhodes

accordingly went over to the Peloponnesians.

At the fame juncture of time, the Athenians, who

had discovered their design, put out with their fleet

from Samos, earnestly bent on'preventing the scheme.

They were seen indeed out at sea by the enemy, but

made their appearance a little too late. For the present,

therefore, they put back to Chalce, and from thence to

Samos; and asterwards, making frequent trips from

Chalce, and Cos, and Samos, they warred against

Rhodes.

The Peloponnesians exacted from the Rhodians a

sum amounting to about * two and thirty talents; and,

* 6zoo/. Sterling.
