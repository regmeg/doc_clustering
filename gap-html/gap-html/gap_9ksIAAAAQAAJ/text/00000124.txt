U2 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B. VI.

"for want of exercise, must infallibly droop and pine

"away, and the whole of her skill grow old and obso-

"lete; but, when inured to uninterrupted conflict, ic

"is continually improving by practice, and will gain a

"persect habit of surmounting every obstacle j not by

"a parade of words, but by active perseverance.

"Upon the whole 1 am firmly convinced, that a

"State, which hath been accustomed to full employ,

"must soon droop into destruction if it resigns itself to

"stoth v and that such persons take the best method

"of infallibly securing their welfare, who adhere most

"steadily to their present customs and laws, though

** possibly better might be substituted in their stead."

In this manner Alcibiades spoke. And the Athe­

nians, moved by his arguments, which were also se­

conded by the intreaties of the Egestean and Leontine

exiles, who, standing forth in the assembly, implored

their protection, and, reminding them of their oaths,

adjured them to redress their wrongs, — declared for the

expedition with a warmer zeal than at any time before.

Nicias was convinced by this, that whatever dissuasion

he could alledge would be quite incapable to change

their refolves. Yet as possibly, by a minute detail

of the immense preparations he was going to demand,

he might caule them at once to change their sentiments,

he stood up again, and re-addressed them as follows:

"I PERCEIVE, Athenians, that your resolutions

"are fixed on this expedition beyond the power of dis-

"suasion; and may its event be such as your wishes

"portend! But I shall once more beg leave to com-

** municate to you my own sense of the affair.

"According to the best informations I have been a-

** ble to procure, we are now going to invade a num-  
"ber of powerful cities, cities independent ofonean-

** other, nor standing in need of public revolutions,  
"which people who cringe under the yoke of slavery

'** mighe
