THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. ,6s

** for the many injuries a neighbouring State, unrelent-  
"ing in its enmity, had done them."

But, to the Athenians, That, in honour, they

"were obliged to signalize their valour in a conspicu-

"ous manner, in the company of numerous and gal-

"lant allies: That, should they gain a victory over

*' the Lacedæmonians on Peloponnesian ground, their  
*' own empire would be established and inlarged, and  
"no enemy would ever again presume to invade their

"territories."

And in this manner were the Argives and their con­

federates animated to the fight.

But the Lacedæmonians were encouraging: one ano-

ther, and, during martial strains injoined by their disci­

pline, like men of bravery as they were, each animated

his neighbour with the recital of the gallant acts they

had performed together. They were persons, who

knew that a long experience in the toils of war condu-

ceth more to preservation, than a short verbal harangue,

how finely soever delivered.

And now the armies were mutually approaching:

The Argives and their allies advanced in a brisk and an­

gry manner; but the Lacedæmonians moved slowly for­

wards to the found of many flutes, the music which

their laws ordain; not from any religious motive, but

for advancing with equal steps, keeping time with the

notes, to prevent all disorders in the ranks; accidents

very frequent in large armies whilst drawing to an en­

counter.*

* Milton hath made use of this Lacedæmonian march to adorn and raise his own  
noble poetry. It was full and strong in his imagination, when he wrote the
following

lines. Paradise Icjl, book J.

—— Anon they move

In prtrfect phalanx, to the Dorian mood

Of flutes and soft recorders; such as rais*d

To height of noblest temper heroes old,
