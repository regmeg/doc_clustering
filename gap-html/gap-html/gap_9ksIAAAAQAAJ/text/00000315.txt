BtV1II. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 303

fleet, even though his collegues declared openly for

keeping their ground and hazarding an engagement by

sea, protested boldly, that " such a step, for his own

"part, he could not take 5 *and, were he able to hin-

** der it, that neither they nor any one should force  
** him to it: For, since it would be afterwards in their  
** power, when they had got better intelligence of the  
"numbers of the enemy, and made what possible ac-

"prepared for action in an ample and leisurely man-

"the dread of a shameful or reproachful imputation

** involve the State, not only in reproach, but in the  
** greatest of dangers;—the State which, but just now  
** respiring from the terrible blows it had received,  
* * scarce thought it prudential with most ample prepa-  
** ration to choose voluntary hazards, or even, when  
"the last necessity demanded, to strike first at the ene-

"my, — why now, when no necessity compelled, must

** it be thrown into wilful spontaneous dangers?" He  
exhorted them, therefore, " without loss of time to

** carry the wounded on-board, to re embark their  
** troops, and, securing what baggage they had brought  
** along with them, to leave behind what booty they  
"had got from the enemy, that their ships might notv

** be too deeply laden, and make the best of their way  
** to Samos; and from thence, after collecting together  
** what additional force they could, to watch for and  
** seize the seasons of advantage to attack their foes."  
The advice of Phrynicus, thus given, was prevailing,

and accordingly was put in execution. He was regar­

ded, not only on the present but on future occasions,
