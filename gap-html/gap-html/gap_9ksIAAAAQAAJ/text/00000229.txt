B. VII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 217

united army, continued to be garrisoned by detachments

from the several States, which at certain intervals of time

relieved one another in a regular succession, it gave ter­

rible annoyance to the Athenians, and caused amongst

them such havoc of their effects, and such a destruction

of their men, as threw them into great distress. All

preceding incursions of the enemy, having been only

transient, had left them in the peaceable enjoyment

want also of all foreign commodities the city was equal­

a place ofarms. To keep guard on the battlements by

day, the citizens were obliged successively to relieve

one another; but the whole body of the city, except
