B.VII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 231

the annoyance which Decelea, now fortified, gave them,

the Athenians were arrived before Syracuse with ano­

ther armament as great and as formidable as the for­

mer *, and that, in every view, the strength of Athens

must be quite unsurmountable. And now also the A-

thenians, who remained of the former armament, re­

spired from that dejection of spirit into which a series of

misfortunes had plunged them.

Demosthenes, after taking a view of the present pos­

ture of affairs, thought it absolutely necessary to avoid

delays, and keep clear of those errors which had done

so much prejudice to Nicias: for Nicias, at his first ap­

pearance, struck an universal consternation ; and yet,

by declining the immediate attack of Syracuse, and loi­

tering a whole winter away at Catana, he became an ob­

ject of contempt; and Gylippus had time to land a suc­

cour from Peloponnesus, which disconcerted all his

measures. That succour, however, the Syracusans

could never have lent for, had Nicias assaulted them on

his first approach: for, deluding themselves with the

thought that they were a match for their foes, they

would have found, by sad experience, that they had

indulged a cruel mistake, and must the same moment

have been invested on all sides: and, in such a state,

though they had invited those succours, yet no effectual

relief could have been obtained from them.

Demosthenes, therefore, reflecting on these past mis­

takes, and sensible that he himself, this very moment,

on the first day of his arrival, appeared most terrible in

the eyes of the enemy, resolved' without loss of time to

improve the present consternation which his reinforce­

ment had struck amongst them. He farther took no­

tice, that the counterwork of the Syracusans, by which

the Athenians had been excluded from perfecting their

cireumvallation, consisted only of a single wall ; and,

in case the heights of Epipolæ could again be regained,

with the camp which at first had been occupied there,

that work might easily be carried, since the defendants
