B.VI. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. Ml

*' ought peace to be so much the object of regard to  
"you as it is to other people, unless you new-model

,c your government, and render it conformable to that

** of your neighbours.

"Weigh therefore these arguments; and be convin-

** ced, that thus only our interest is capable of any con-  
** siderable advancement,—if we proceed against Sicily,  
"and execute the expedition in order to deject the

** haughty Peloponnesian spirit, by so plain art instance  
"how much we despise them, how little fond we are at

"present of this inactive interval, and how eager to

"begin again with a Sicilian voyage. And, by acting

"thus, there is probability on our side, that, in cafe

"we subdue the people there, we may gain the sove-

"reignty over all Greece; or, at worst, we shall de-

"press the Syracusan power: The latter point alone

will be an important service to ourselves. and our at-

"lies. But, in case any measure of success attends us,

** our ships will enable us to secure our acquisitions, or  
** at worst our departure: For, though the whole body  
"of the Sicilians combine together against us, we shall

"be absolute masters of our own retreat.

"Let not therefore the words of Nicias, calculated

*• merely for the service of sloth, and to raise dissentions  
** between the young and the old, disconcert your plan.  
"But let the usual decorum take place, observant

- ** of which our forefathers, at whose consultations both  
"the seniors and the youths assisted, exalted this State

** to its present height; and do you now, adhering to  
** the established practice, endeavour its farther exasta-

** red one another's reciprocal assistance, lose all their  
** influence and weight; that, on the other hand, from  
ct the wildness of youth, and the moderation of the

"middle-aged, and the consummate prudence of the

"old, when tempered harmoniously together, the most

** persect strength must infallibly result that a State,  
"which supinely gives way to sloth, like other things

** for
