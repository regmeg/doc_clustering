B.VII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 237

urged ** the immediate execution of the scheme he had

*' formed before he made the late dangerous attempt  
"upon Epipolse; which since it had miscarried, they

"should no longer protract their departure, whilst yet

*' the season of the year was proper for their voyage

hope that the state of the latter would soon become

worse than their own, would they only continue to press

the siege. A want of supplies must soon reduce them

to great straits -, and this the sooner, as, by the acces­

masters of the sea. And, what is more, in Syracuse

itself there was a party which wished to see the city fall

into their hands. These had dispatched their agents to

Nicias, and insisted he should not quit the siege. Yet,

thus enlightened as he was, in reality he knew not how

to act, as his mind was balanced between two mea­

sures, which equally required mature deliberation. But,

for the present, he openly declared himself in council
