34o THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VIII.

even they caused their cavalry, and detachments of their

heavy-armed, light-armed, and archers, to sally out

into the field, who made a slaughter of such as were too

far advanced, and became masters of their arms and

dead bodies ; — finding then he had proceeded upon

'wrong presumptions, he again drew oft7 his army. Af­
