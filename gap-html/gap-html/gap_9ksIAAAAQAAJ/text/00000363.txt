B.VIIL THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 35s

** station where they might be sure of subsistence, the  
"crews would abandon their vessels. And the whole

"blame of all that befel ought to be charged upon

"Astyochus, who for private lucre endured patiently

"the caprices of Tissaphernes." Employed as they

were in thus enumerating grievances, a tumult actually

broke out against Astyochus: For the mariners belong­

ing to the Syracusan and Thurian vessels, by how much

they enjoyed the greatest liberty of all others in the fleet,

by so much the more heightened confidence did they

flock about him and demand their pay. Upon this,

Astyochus returned an answer too full of spirit, threat­

ening hard * that Dorian, who seconded and encoura­

ged the demands of his men, and even lifting up his

stars and shaking it at him. This was no sooner per­

ceived by the military croud, than, seamen as they

were, with a loud uproar, they rushed at Astyochus to

knock him down: But, aware of their design, he flies

for refuge to an altar. He escaped, indeed, without

any blows, and the fray was ended without any harm

committed. '' .

The Milesians also made themselves •masters, by fur-

prise, of a fort erected by Tissaphernes at Miletus,

and oblige the garrison left in it to evacuate the place.

These things pleased the rest of the allies, and not least

of all the Syracusans. Lichas, however, was by no

means satisfied with these proceedings. Ht insisted

** the Milesians were obliged in duty to be submissive  
** to Tissaphernes; and that all others who lived in the  
*' dominions of the king lay under the same obligation,  
"and were bound to pay due regard to his juct autho-

** rity, till such time as the war was handsofnely com-  
*' pleted." This drew upon him the re sent mem of the  
.Milesians; and., because of these expressions and some

others of the fame nature, when he afterwards died of

a natural disease, they woutd not suffer him to be bu-
