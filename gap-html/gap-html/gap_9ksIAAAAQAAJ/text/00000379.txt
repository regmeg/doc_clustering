E.VUI. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 367

aright. A moderation, finely tempered between the

few and the many, was now inforced. And, from the

low situation into which their affairs were now plunged,

this enabled Athens co re-erect her head.

They decreed, sarther, the recallroent of Alcibiades

and his adherents; and, dispatching a deputation to him

and the army at Samos, exhorted them to exert their

utmost efforts for the public service.

In the first moments of this new revolution, Pisander

and Alexicles, with their partisans, and in general all

the great sticklers for the oligarchy, withdraw privately

to Decelea. But Aristarchus, who was one of the ge­

nerals of the State, took a different route from all the

rest; and, carrying off a party of archers, though rank

Barbarians, went off towards Oenoe: Oenoe was a for­

tress of the Athenians on the frontiers of Bœotia. But

the Corinthians, on a provocation peculiar to them­

selves, having procured the concurrence of the Bœo­

tians, held it now blocked up, because a party of their

countrymen, drawing off from Decelea, had been put

to the sword by a sally of the garrison from Oenoe. A-

ristarchus, therefore, having in a conference settled mat­

ters with the besiegers, deceives the garrison in Oenoe,

by afluring them, that, " as their, countrymen in A-

"dasmonians, they also were bound to deliver up this

*' place to the Bœotians; and that this was an exprese  
"provision in the treaty." Qiying credit therefore to

htm as in public command, and ignorant of all the late

transactions because closely blocked up, they agree with

the enemy and evacuate the fortress. In this manner

the Bœotians regained possession of abandoned Oenoe:

And thus the oligarchy and sedition were suppressed at

Athens.
