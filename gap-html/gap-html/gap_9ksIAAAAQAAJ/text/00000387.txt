B.VIII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 375

having procured from Abydus a party of heavy-armed

.who marched across mount Ida, received them into

their city, provoked to this step by the injurious con­

duct of Arsaces, a Persian, lieutenant to Tisiaphernes.

This man, pretending he had enemies to cope with

whom yet he never named, prevailed with the Delians

settled in Adramittium, because they had been obliged

by the Athenians to quit Delos in the affair of the ex­

piation, to attend him in this secret expedition with the

flower of their strength; and, leading them forwards

with ail the shew of friendship and alliance, watched

the opportunity when they were busy at their meal,

surrounded them with a body of his own soldiers, and

shot them to death with darts. Fearing him, therefore,

because os this instance of a cruel temper, lest some

such act of violence he might execute also upon them,

as in other respects he had imposed some burdens upon

them which they could not bear, the Antandrians eject

his garrison out of their citadel. But Tissaphernes,

perceiving how deeply the Peloponnesians were con­

cerned in this affair, and esteeming himself sadly in­

jured also at Miletus and Cnidus (since in those places

too his garrisons had been ejected); and fearing they

would proceed to other commissions of the same nature;

chagrined moreover that perhaps Pharnabazus, in less

time and with less expence, having obtained their con­

currence, should make a greater progress against the

Athenians; — he determined in person to repair to Hel­

lespont, in order to expostulate with them about their

late proceedings at Antander, and to wipe off, as hand­

somely as he could, the aspersions thrown upon his own

conduct in regard to the Phœnician fleet and other points.

Arriving therefore first at Epheius, he offered sacrifice
