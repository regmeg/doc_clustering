£.V. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 21

Their remonstrances had no effect upon the Lacedæmo­

nians, who sent them away without redress, and struck

up forthwith an alliance, offensive and defensive, with

the Athenians. They had reason to conclude that

*' the Argives would come to no agreement with  
"them," fince they had lately declared a negative to

their embassadors, Ampelidas and Lichas; "and yet

'* these Argives," theyjudged, " could be no dreadful

M foe without the Athenians; and that the rest of Pelo-

"ponnems would not now presume to interfere, who,

"without this method of prevention, would certainly

*' have gone over to the Athenians." An Athenian  
embassy, therefore, being at this crisis resident amongst

them, a conference was holden, and the terms complete­

ly adjusted. The ratification was made by solemn oath,

and the articles of this alliance, offensive and defensive,

were these:

"THE Lacedæmonians enter into this alliance for

"the term of fifty years.—Provided that,

"If any enemy enter the territories of the Lacedæ-

"monians, and commit any manner of hostilities to

*' their prejudice, the Athenians march forthwith to  
"their succour, with all the possible means of redress,

** and with their whole united force.

"And, in case fucji invaders shall have withdrawn

** themselves, that the State under which they acted be  
*' declared an enemy both to the Lacedæmonians and  
** the Athenians, both which are to join in acting of-  
*' fensively against that State, nor to lay down their  
*» arms without the mutual consent of both the con-  
*' trailing States.

** These terms to be observed with honour, with ala-  
*' crity, and without any fraud whatever.

** Provided, farther,— That, if any enemy enter  
M the territories of the Athenians, and commit hostili-

*' ties to the prejudice of the Athenians, the Lacedæ-  
M monians march forthwith to their succour, with all
