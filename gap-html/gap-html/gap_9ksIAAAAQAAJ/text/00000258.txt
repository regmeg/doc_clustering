246 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.V1I.

with the Lacedæmonians and Corinthians, they had ob­

jected their own State to the fury of a storm which

threatened them all, and, by their own personal valour

in naval engagements, had contributed most to such a

height of success.

The various people, now got together at this one city
