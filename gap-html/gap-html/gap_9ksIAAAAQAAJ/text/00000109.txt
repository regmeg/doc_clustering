war with the latter, about some connubial points, and a

certain tract of land to which both laid claim. The

Selinuntians, farther4 assisted by their Syracuf'an allies,

pressed hard upon them both by land and sea. And

hence, the Egesteans were now suggesting at Athens,

that *' they ought not to forget their alliance with the

*' Leonttnes, made by Laches in the former warre*  
questing farther, that a naval force might be sent thither

for their succour. To this purpose many other argu­

decreed, that "embassadors should be previously dis-
