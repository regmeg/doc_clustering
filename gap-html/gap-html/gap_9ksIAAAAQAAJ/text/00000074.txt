62 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR: 6.V,

withdrawn, and quite out of their view, after lying in­

actively in their posts, and no orders received sor a

pursuit, they began a second time to lay heavy imputa­

tions on their own commanders;—that, "on the for-

"mer occasion, the Lacedæmonians, when fairly

* * caught near Argos, had been susfered to escape y  
** that now again, though they were openly flying, not  
"a soul must pursue them, but, through shameful in-

* * dolence, their enemies are preserved, and themselves  
** are treacherously betrayed." The commanders, up­  
on the first noise of these clamours, were highly chagri­

ned, but afterwards they marched them down srom the

eminence, and, advancing into the plain, encamped

them there, as determined to fight the enemy. The

day following, the Argives and allies were drawn up

to be in readiness for action, should the enemy appear.

And the Lacedæmonians, marching away from the

stream, to re-occupy their former camp near the tem­

ple of Hercules, on a sudden perceived that the whole

body of their foes were ready drawn up in order of bat­

tle, and had quitted their strong post on the eminence.

At this crisis, the Lacedæmonians were struck with a

grearer astonishment than the memory of man could

parallel. For now, in an interval os time excee­

ding short, they were bound to get every thing in rea­

diness for fight: Yet, such was their diligence, that in

an instant they were formed into a beautiful array, A-

gis, their kingjissuing all the necessary orders, according to

law; for, when a king leadeth their armies, all orders

are given by him: He himself declareth what he willeth

to be done to the * general-officers; they carry his orders

to the -f colonels; these to the J captains; who after­

wards forward them to the § subalterns; by whom they

are communicated to all the private men under their re-
