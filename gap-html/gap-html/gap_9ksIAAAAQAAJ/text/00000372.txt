360 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VIII.

Hitherto, indeed, this charge against them had only

been whispered with an air of secrecy amongst a few.

But, when Phrynichus, upon his return from the em-

bassy to Lacedæmon, was treacherously stabbed, by one

of the patrole in the forum, at the hour of public resort,

bjing got but a few steps from the house where the

council was sitting, and dropped down dead upon the

Aristocrates himself was employed at the head of his

own band, lay under an arrest Alexicles, who com­

manded there for the oligarchy, and was a most vehe­

him into a houie, put him under confinement. To this

action they were also emboldened by the concurrence
