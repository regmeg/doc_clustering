*' cipline to service, and force such to join as on choice  
"would refuse their concurrence: for, by such a step,

'* those who are already your friends will be animated

"with higher degrees of resolution, and those who

"fluctuate at present will join you with a smaller sense

"of fear.

"It behoves you also to make war upon the Athe-
