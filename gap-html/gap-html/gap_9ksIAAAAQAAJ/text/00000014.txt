a THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.V.

soon as the suspension of arms expired, having under his

command twelve hundred neavy-armed Athenians, three

hundred horsemen, and larger numbers of their allied

forces. His whole armament consisted of thirty sail.

Touching first at Scione, yet blocked up, he drew from

thence the heavy-armed, stationed there as guards; and,

standing away, entered the haven of the Colophonians,

lying at no great distance from Torone. Being here

informed, by the deserters, that Brasidas was not in

Torone, nor the inhabitants able to make head against

him, he marched his forces by land towards that city,

and sent ten of his ships about, to stand into the harbour.

His first approach was to the new rampart, which Bra­

sidas had thrown up quite round the city, in order to

inclose the suburbs within its cincture, and thus, by the

demolition of the old wall, had rendered it one intire ci­

ty. When the Athenians came to the assault, Pasiteli-

rhe Knights of Aristophanes. Arid, to set it in the most ludicrous view, the
poet opens

his play with Nieias and Demosthenes, whom he paints in a very injurious
manner;

and, no doubt, it must have been very grating to them, to fee themselves
represented

in fo low buffoonery upon the stage at Athens. *' Demosthenes begins with a
shower

"of curses on that execrable Paphlagonian, Cleon; Nicias seconds him j and,
then,

<* both of them howl together in a most lamentable duetto. They next lay their

"heads together about some means of redress. Demosthenes proposeth getting out

"of their master Cleon's reach. Lei us go then, fays Nicias. Ay; let us go,
cries

*' Demosthenes. Say mere, fays Nicias, lit us go ever to the enemy. Ay, ever to tie  
"enemy, adds the other. But first, ftys Nicias, let us go and f rostrate
ourselves before

** the Images of the Gods. What images? fays Demajthenes; dost thou think then there  
"are any Cods? I do. Upon ivhat grounds? Because I am undeservedly tbetbjetl
of

*' their hatred. Such are the daring misrepresentations Aristophanes makes of  
*' characters that by no means deserved it t Demosthenes afterwards describes the  
*' arrogance of Cleon thus; He hath one foot fixed in Py/ut, and the other in the astern-  
** hly of the feofle. When he moves, he struts and stretches at such a rate, that bis turn*  
"is in Thrace, hit bands in Ætolia, and bis attention amongst the tribes at
home, •

"Nicias then proposeth poisoning themselves by drinking bull's blood, like
ThemiC

** tocles;—Or rather, fays Demosthenes, a dose of good-wine. This is agreed upon,  
* in order to cheer up their spirits, and enable them to confront Cleon, and play off  
"against him the seller of black-puddings. Nicias accordingly goes and steals
the

"wine." Yet, in spite of the most outrageous ridicule, and the opposition of
alL

wife and honest men at Athens, we fee Cleon now at the head of an army, to
stop the

rapid conquests of Brasidas,
