** tertain an endless distrust of them. The truth is this,  
"that without your concurrence we are not able tocofl-

** tinue here. And in case, with perfidy open and a-  
** vowed, we make seizure of your cities, yet we are  
** unable to retain their possession, remote as they lie  
** from Athens; as cities fo large we never could gar-  
** rison; and as they are farther provided in all respects  
** as well as any on the continent. But, on the contra-  
** ry, the Syraculans will not rush upon you from a  
** camp upon the beach; but, posted in a city more  
** formidable in strength than the" whole of our arma-  
ment, they are ever meditating your ruin, and, when

they have seized a proper oppoitunity, will strike the

** blow. They have afforded you instances of this al-  
"ready, and a flagrant one indeed in the cafe of the

Leontines. And yet they have the effrontery now,

by words, as if you were so to be deluded, to exas-

"perate you against us, who have hitherto comrouled

"their views, and deterred them to this moment from

** making all Sicily their prey.

Our arguments have a tendency directly opposite.

** We have nothing in view but your certain and affu-  
** red prelervation, when we earnestly conjure you not  
wilfully to betray the mean's which at present will rtf-

** suit from our union, which we can mutually exert in  
** one another's behalf; and strongly to represent to  
** your own reflexions, thar, even without the concur-  
"rence of allies, a road to your reduction will at any

** time be open to these Syracusans through their own  
** superior numbers; but an opportunity exceedingly  
** seldom afforded you to make head against thettl  
** with so large an auxiliary body. And if, from  
** groundless suspicions, you suffer now fo large a body  
** to depart either unsuccessful or defeated, yet a time  
will come when you will ardently wish to see them

** return, though in a much less proportion of strength,  
** and they have it no longer in their power to cross the  
<* lea for your lupport. Take care, theresore, Cama-
