io8 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B. VII.

But the motives, which at this present juncture anima­

ted the Lacedæmonians most, were, that the Atheni­

ans, if engaged in a double war both against themselves

and against the Sicilians, must become a much more

expeditious conquest; and, farther, the Athenians were

the first aggressors in violating treaties. In the former

war they were well convinced the first offence was

chargeable on their own heads, because the Thebans

had surprised Platæa whilst treaties were in fact subsist­

ing. Nay, contrary to an express stipulation in a pre­

ceding treaty, that " arms should never be taken up

*' against the party which was willing to abide by a ju-

submit to a trial, though claimed by the Athenians.

To a conduct so ungenerous they concluded that their

ill success in the war ought fairly to be imputed; and

reflected, with self-accusations, not only on the cala­

mity they had suffered at Pylus, but On all their other

losses in every quarter of the war. But now, since the

Athenians, with an equipment of thirty fail, had com­

mitted devastations at Epidaurus, at Prasiæ, and at

other places, and continued to infest their dominions

by robberies from Pylus; nay, as often as disputes had

intervened about the intent of articles in the last treaty,

in which the Lacedæmonians appealed to a judicial de­

termination, the others had haughtily refused it j — con­

cluding hence, that the Athenians were become as

guilty aggressors now as themselves had been on the

former occasion; with cheerful presages of success, they

determined for war. In order to it, they demanded

this winter, from their allies, their contingents of iron,

and got all the needful materials in readiness to execute

their plan of fortification. Resolved at the same time

to transport an aid to Sicily in vessels of burden, they

began to levy it at home, and exacted the quotas of

augmentation from their consederates. And thus the

winter ended; and the eighteenth year of this war, of
