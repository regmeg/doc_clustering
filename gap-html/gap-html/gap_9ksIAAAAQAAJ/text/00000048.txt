whole plan to fink away in careless and dilatory uncon­

cern.

In this fame winter, the Olynthians, after a sudden

assault, took Mecyberne, which was garrisoned by A-

thenians..,

After the former proceedings,—for conferences were

still continued between the Athenians and Lacedæmo­

nians about those places they held from one another, —

the Lacedæmonians, conceiving some hope that, if the

Athenians could recover Panactum from the Bœotians,

they also might regain Pyius, addressed themselves in

solemn embassy to the Bœotians, and importuned them

to deliver up Panactum and the Athenian prisoners,

that they in return might get Pylus from them. But

the Bœotians persisted in a resusal, unless they would make

a separate alliance with them, as they had done with the

Athenians. Upon this the Lacedæmonians, though

convinced that such a step would be injustice to the A-

thenians,— since it had been stipulated that, " without

"joint consent, they should neither make peace nor

they might exchange it for Pylus, the party at the fame

time amongst them, who were meditating a fresh rupture,

inclining to the Bœotian interest, made the requisite alli­

ance in the very close of this winter on the approach of

spring. The consequence was, that Panactum was im­

mediately levelled with the ground; and the eleventh

year of the war was brought to a conclusion.
