46 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B. V*

* * vade the territory of the Eleans, or that of the Man-  
"tineans, or that of the Argives, in strict conformity to

** a summons received from any of those States, in the  
"most vigorous manner they may be able, to the ful-

** ness of their abilities.

"But if the enemy, after ravaging, be again with-

"drawn, the State under which they acted to be decla-

** red an enemy to the Athenians, and Argives, and  
"Mantineans, and Eleans, and to be pursued with the

"ofsensive arms of all these confederate States.

"And farther, that it be not lawful to lay down

* * their- arms against the Stale which hath so ofsended,  
** without the joint consent of all these contracting  
** States.

"That no armed force be admitted to pass in order

** for war through any of their respective dominions, or  
"those of their respective dependents, nor along their

"sea, unless such a passage be granted unanimously by

** all the contracting parties, by the Athenians, and Ar-  
"gives, and Mantineans, and Eleans.

** Agreed farther, that, when the auxiliaries attend4  
"the State which summoned them supply them with

"thirty days provision so soon as they shall have enter-

"ed the territory of the State which summoned their

"attendance, and the same at their departure. .

"And, it there be occasion for the attendance of such

"an auxiliary force for a larger space, that the State

** which sent for it maintain that force, by paying to e-  
** very soldier, heavy-armed and lighc-armed, and e-  
** very archer, three oboli of Ægina f a day, and a  
"drachma of Ægina to every hoiieman.

'** But the State which sent for auxiliaries to have the

** supreme command, lo long as the war continueth  
"within its district.: :•,

•s- The value of three oboli of Ægina is about six-pence, and the drachma of
Æ-

gina nearly one sliilling, EngliJIi': For, according to Dr. Arbuthnot, the
talent

of JEgina consisted of a hundred. Attic, win*, and therefore was larger than
the Attic

talent in the proportion of one hundred to sixty.
