2S8 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.Vlh

When the Syracusan generals, seconded by Gylippus,

had finished this their exhortation to their own soldiers,

they also, in their turn, repaired immediately on-board

their fleet, as they found was already done by the Athe­

nians. • •. t

But Nicjas, whose mind was surcharged with present

cares, sensible how extreme the danger, and how nearly

approaching! since this very moment they were only

not in motion; and once more reflecting, that, as ge­

nerally happens in affairs of such prodigious moment,

some points might yet be left imperfect, something of

energy, and weight, and influence, be yet left unlaid j

he called out again upon every single captain in the fleet,

addressing himself separately to them, with the honour­

able mention of their fathers, themselves, and their tribe;

and conjuring each, by his own distinguishing splendor,

whatever it was, "not now to betray it, nor tarnish

** those hereditary virtues on which their ancestors had  
"sounded their gloryreminding them earnestly

of the uninterrupted freedom of their country, and

"the privilege they had ever enjoyed of living in it

"quite free and uncontrouled •" asserting other argu­

ments, soch as, with men who had their all so much at

stake, might have influence and weight; no matter

now how trite or hackneyed by frequent repetitions,

pr how equally applicable to every case, as fetched from

the endearments of their wives, and their offspring, and

their paternal gods; such as from every topic, in a

plunge of horror and distress, are rung in the ears

of men, as likely to animate and persuade. And thus

at last, though fearful that not even yet he had said c-

nough, but all that the time would permit, he parted

from them; and, placing himself at the head of the

land-army, marched down to the beach; where he

drew them up in as large a line as they could possibly

form, that their appearance might have the greater ef­

fect in emboldening those on-board the fleet.
