B.VIII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 285

Amidst these employments of both parties, which

.were nothing less than most earnest preparations on all

sides, as if war was just in its commencement, the Eu-

bœans took the lead, and sent embassadors this winter

to treat with Agis about a revolt from the Athenians.

Agis accepted what terms they proposed; and sends

for Alcamenes, the son of Sthenelai'das, and Melanthus,

frorrr Lacedæmon, to pass over as commanders into

Eubcea. Accordingly they arrived, with a body of *ci­

tizens newly infranchised, to the number of about three

hundred; and Agis was preparing for their transporta­

tion. But in this interval the Lesbians arrived, with

declarations of their readiness to revolt; and, as they

were seconded by the recommendations of the Bœotians,

Agis is persuaded to put off for a time the affair of Eu­

bcea, and began to expedite the revolt of the Lesbians,

having assigned them Alcamenes for their governor, who

was to have passed over to Eubœa. The Bœotians

promised to send them ten ships, and Agis ten. These

points were transacted without the privity of the Lace­

dæmonian State: For Agis, so long as he continued at

Decelea, having under his command the army of the

State, was invested with a power of sending detachments

whithersoever he thought proper, and to levy men and

money at his own discretion; and it may with

truth be affirmed, that the confederates, during

this period, paid a much greater deference to him

than to the State of Lacedæmon; for, having a power­

ful force under his own orders, he was formidable in his

every motion. And thus he arbitrarily settled the ne­

gotiation of the Lesbians.

But then the Chians and the Erythræans, who were

also desirous to revolt, addressed themselves, not to A-

gis, but at Lacedæmon. In their company also went

thither an embassador from Tissaphernes, who was lieu­

tenant for Darius, the son of Anaxerxes, in the mari-

* Neodamodes.
