B.VI. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 173

rineans, that neither yourselves nor others be decei-

** ved by a too credulous belief of the bold calumnia-  
** tions these Syracusans utter. We have now laid be-  
"fore you the true ground of all those sad suspicions

"which are fomented against us; but shall again recal

** them to your remembrance by a short recapitulation,  
"that they may have the proper influence upon you.

"We declare, therefore, that we rule in Greece

"merely to prevent our being inflaved; but are intent

"on vindicating liberty in Sicily, to suppress that an-

** noyance which might otherwise be given us from  
"hence ;— that mere necessity obligeth us to embark in

t* many undertakings, because we have many sinister

** incidents to guard against; — that now and formerly  
** we came hither to support those Sicilians who have  
"been unjustly oppressed; not uninvited, but solemnly

** conjured to take such steps. Attempt not, there-  
** fore, to divert our pursuits, either by erecting your-  
"stives into censors of our proceedings, or into correc-

"tors of our politics, a point too disficult for you to

"manage. But, so much of our activity or conduct

** as you can mould into a consistency with your own  
** welsare, lay hold of that, and employ it to your best  
** advantage; and never imagine that our politics are  
"equally prejudicial to all the world besides, but high-

"ly benesicial to the bulk of the Grecians. For,

** through every quarter, even those which we cannot  
** pretend to controul, both such as dread impending  
** mischiefs and such as meditate incroachments,— lay-  
"ing hold on both sides of the ready expectation; the

** former, that redress may be obtained by our interpo-  
"fition; the latter, that, if we think proper to oppose

** them, their own sasety will be greatly endangered;—'  
** both sides, I fay, are hence obliged; the latter, to  
** practise moderation, though with regret; the former*  
** to enjoy tranquillity without previous embroilments  
"of the public peace. The security, therefore, which

** now offers itself to your acceptance, and is always

V ready
