B.VII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 227

manner as the Syracusans: —- that, finally, the Athe­

nians could not possibly get out into wider sea, as the

entrance of the harbour and the space behind the lines

of battle were in their own command; nay, other ob­

stacles would co-operate, such as Plemmyrium, which

would now oppose any attempt of this kind, and the

.very nature of the harbour's mouth, which was exceed­

ing narrow.

By such a project the Syracusans had given an increase

to their former skill and strength; and, animated more

than ever by the thought of having improved from

their errors in the former engagement, they sallied out

to encounter the enemy both with their land and naval

force. Gylippus (hewed himself, a small portion of

time before the rest, at the head of the infantry; whom,

Jallying out of the city, he drew up near the Athenian

Entrenchment, in that quarter where it faced the city.

Then the garrison of Olympiæum, to a man, as well

heavy-armed as horsemen, with all the light-armed

parties of the Syracusans, came and drew up on the

other quarters; and, immediately after, the ships of

rthe Syracusans and their allies came sailing forwards.

The Athenians at first imagined that at present they

were threatened only with an assault by land; but

when, on a sudden, they saw the fleet bearing down a-

gainst them, they were struck with confusion. Some

t>f them were taking post upon and without the intrench-

ments, to make head against the assailants; others

were sallied forth to encounter the troops srom Olym­

piæum, and those from remoter parts coming on with

full speed, & numerous body of horsemen and darters.

The rest were hurrying on-board to man the ships, or

to give what assistance they could upon the beach: and

no sooner were the proper complements on-board than

ieventy-five ships stood out to meet the enemy; but

then the number of the enemy's vessels was abouc

eighty.
