in a short time ascerwards, they were again restored to

their full privileges.

The fame summer also the Dictideans took Thyssus,

a town seated upon the Athos, and consederate with

the Athenians.

Through the whole course of the summer, the com­

munication was open between the Peloponneflans and

Athenians. Not but that the Athenians and LacedaM

monians began to be jealous of one another immediately
