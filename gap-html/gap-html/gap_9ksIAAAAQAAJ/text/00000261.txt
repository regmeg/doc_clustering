B.VII. THE PELOPONNESTAN WAR. 249

several nations of Greek descent settled in Sicily, being

all Doric, and independent, acted together in concert.

Of the barbarous people they had those Siculi alone

who did not openly revolt to the Athenians; but, out

of Sicily, the Lacedæmonians sent them a citizen of Spar­

ta to command, and a body of Neodamodes and Helots.

By a Neodamas is meant a citizen newly enfranchised.

The Corinthians alone aided them both with shipping

and a-land-force, in conjunction with the Leucadians

and Ambiaciots, by blood allied to Syracuse. From

Arcadia also came a body of mercenaries, sent by the

Corinthians and the Sicyonians, who acted on com­

pulsion; and of those who dwell without the Pelopon­

nesus were the Bœotians. But, beside these foreign

aids, the Sicilians, as possessed of great and powerful

cities, furnished out in all respects a much greater and

well-appointed force: For by them a numerous body

of heavy-armed, of ships, and horses, and other kinds

of military force, in an amazing abundance, were rai­

sed and brought to Syracuse. And yet it must be said,

that the domestic force of the Syracusans was more to

be considered than all the rest, from the greatness of their

State and the immediate urgency of those perils with

which they were environed.

These were the aids, the numerous aids, assembled

together by the contending parties; and at this juncture

all these were present on each side of the contest; and

from this crisis neither party received any accession.

The Syracusans therefore and their consederates

thought, since the signal victory they had gained upon

the water, it would be a brave exploit, and highly for

their glory, to make the whole extensive camp of the

Athenians their prize, and cut off their retreat on

both elements, both by land and lea. With this pro­

ject, they immediately barred up the great harbour,

the mouth of which is about * eight stadia over, with a

P Near a mile.
