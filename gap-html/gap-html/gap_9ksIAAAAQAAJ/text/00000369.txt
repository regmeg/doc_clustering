B.VIII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 357

non, and Aristocrates, the son of Sicelius; and others

who were most deeply concerned in late transac­

tions; and from a dread, as they gave our, of the army

at Samos, and Alcibiades, had concurred in sending an

embassy to Lacedæmon, lest by unseasonable dissents

from the majority they might have done mischief to the

public. Not that they hasted themselves even now to

put an utter end to the oligarchical government, but to

inforce the necessity of making use of the five thousand

not merely in name but in act, and to render the polity

more equal. This was, it must be owned, the politi­

cal scheme which they all pretended; but, through pri­

vate ambition, the majority had given into that course,

by which an oligarchy, founded upon the ruins of a de~

mocracy, is ripe for subversion: For it was the daily

claim of each single person concerned, not to be equal

with the rest, but to be pre-eminently the first; where­

as, when out of a democracy a preference is awarded,

the distinction is the more easily brooked, as if it were

the real consequence os superior worth. But what of a

of Alcibiades at Samos, and their own conscioulnels

that this business of an oligarchy carried with it no pros­

therefore, ensued among them, which of them should

shew the greatest zeal for the people.

But such of the four hundred as made the greatest op­

party ; — namely, Phrynichus, who formerly, during

made large enough for any foot to go into it. He was however a man of great
abili­

dextrous, well-

timed, and made with a view of public good. Caesar, when making Cicero a

compliment, likened him to Theramenes. He was deeply concerned in all the
subse­

quent revo'utions at Athens. He put the finishing hand to the peace with the
Lace­

dæmonians after the talcing of Athens by Lyfander, when they demolished their

long walls, opened their harbours, and gave up their shipping. He was
afterwards,

nominally, one of the thirty tyrants: For he soon began to oppose them; first
with

moderation, then with vehemence j which exasperated them so, that they put him

to death,
