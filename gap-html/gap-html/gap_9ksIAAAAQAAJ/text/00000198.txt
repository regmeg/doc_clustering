i86 -THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VI.

racusans refrained from sallying out against them, they

again drew off, and raised a fort at Labdalum, on the

very steepest edge of Epipolæ, looking towards Mega-

ra, which they intended as a repository for their bag­

gage and money, whilst themselves might be called off,

Soon after this they were joined by a body of three

They made some slaughter amongst them, and erected a

On the day following, some of the Athenians began

to raise a wall along the northern side of their drtU\
