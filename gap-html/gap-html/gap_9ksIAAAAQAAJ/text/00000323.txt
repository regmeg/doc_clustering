B.VIir. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 3rr

*' in cafe an accommodation be taken in hand, be it  
*' settled by both parties acting in conjunction.

"But, whatever army be brought info the territo-

** ries of the king at the request, and summons of the  
"king, the king to defray the expence.

*' And, if any of the States, comprehended in this  
"league with the king, invade the territories of the

"king, the others to oppose and act with all their power

** in defence of the king.

"And, if any province belonging to the king, or

"subject to his dominion, invade the territory of the

"Lacedæmonians or confederates; the king to oppose,

** and with all his power to defend the party invaded."

When the finishing-hand was put to this treaty,

Theramenes, after delivering up the fleet to Astyo-

chus, puts to sea in a fly-boat, and entirely disappears.-

But the Athenians from Lesbos, having now made

their passage and landed their forces in Chios, and be­

ing masters of the coast and sea, fortified Delphinium;

a place remarkably strong by nature towards the land,

abounding, farther, with harbours, and seated at no

considerable distance from the city of the Chians. And,

now the Chians, dispirited by the many defeats they

had already received, and, what is worse, far from be­

ing actuated by general unanimity, (bur, on the con­

trary, Tydeus the Ionian and his adherents having

been lately put to death by Pædaritus for atticizing,

and the rest of the citizens obliged by necessity to sub­

mit to the few, each individual amongst them suspect­

ing his neighbour,) — the Chians now remained quite

inactive. Thus, for the reasons above-mentioned, they

neither looked upon themselves, nor the auxiliaries un­

der Pædaritus, as a match for the enemy. Yet, as

theit last resource, they send to Miletus, requesting As-

tyochus to come over to their succour. But, as he was

deaf to their intreaties, Pædaritus fends a letter to La­

cedæmon about him, which accused him of injustice.
