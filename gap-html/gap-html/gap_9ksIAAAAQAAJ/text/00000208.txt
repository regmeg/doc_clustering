of the town, with the whole of their strength, in order

to meet Gylippus for by this time they had received

intelligence that he was actually approaching.

Gylippus, upon his route, had made himself master

of Iegas, a fortress belonging to the Siculi; and now,

at the head of his army, drawn up in order of battle, he

comes up to Epipolse. Having mounted by the pass

of Euryalus, as the Athenians had done on their first:

approach, he marched, in Conjunction with the Syra­

cusans, toward the Athenian circumvallation. He

happened to arrive in that critical juncture, when the

Athenians had completely finished * seven or eight stadia

of the double wall extending to the great harbour j

when, in consequence, but a very small part remained

incomplete; and on which they were labouring with

their highest application. On the other side of their cir­

cle, towards Trogilus, the stones for completing their

work had been laid ready in heaps almost down to the

beach, and some parts of their work on that side stood

but half completed, though others had received the fi-

, nishing hand. To such extremity of danger were the

Syracusans now reduced.

Gylippus and the Syracusans coming thus suddenly

upon them, the Athenians at first were struck with con­

sternation; but formed, however, in order of battle, to

give them a reception. But Gylippus, having ordered

his forces to halt, dispatcheth a herald to the Athe­

nians, proclaiming that, " in case they would evacu-

** ate Sicily within the space of five days, with their  
"arms and baggage, he would readily grant them a

"truce." Such offers they received in a contemptuous

manner jf and, disdaining to return an answer4 ordered

* About J of a mile.

Nicias (fays Plalareb) disdained to return an answer. But seme of hit soldiers

laughed outright, and asked "If, at the arrival of a mantle and stasf from
Sparta,

"the Syracusans were become so full of spirits as to despise the Athenians;
who

*• had lately given up to the Lacedæmonians three hundred of their countrymen  
"who had been their prisoners, all of them better soldiers, and who combed

"their hair, too, much hetter, than Gylippus."
