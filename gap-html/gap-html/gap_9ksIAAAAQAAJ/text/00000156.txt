Of Pythian Phœbus, radiant God of day,

Chose thus the temple to adorn,

'And thus record his own superior sway.

But, farther, that Hippias succeeded in the govern­

ment as the eldest son, 1 myself can positively aver; as

I know it to be so, and have examined all the accounts

of tradition with much greater accuracy than others.

But any one may be convinced of the fact by what I

am going to subjoin. — Now, we have abundant light to

prove, that he was the only one of the legitimate bro-

chcrs who had any sons. So much the altar attests,

and the column erected for a perpetnal brand of the in­

justice of the tyrants in the citadel of Athens. In the

latter, the inscription makes no mention of any son, of

either Thessalus or Hipparchus; but nameth five sons

of Hippias, who were brought him by Myrrhine, the

daughter of Callias, the fon of Hyperochidas. It

is certainly most probable that the eldest son was marri­

ed first; nay he is named the first after his father on

the upper part of the column. And there were good

reasons for this preserence; because his seniority gave

him this rank; and because he succeeded to the tyranny.

Nor can it in any light seem probable to me, that Hip­

pias, on a sudden and with ease, could have seized the

tyranny, had Hipparchus died when invested with ic,

and he had only one day's time to effect his own esta­

blishment. The reverse is the truth j that, having for

a length of time been familiarized to the expectation,

having rendered himself awful to the citizens, and being

supported by vigilant and trusty guards, he received

and enjoyed his power with abundant security. He

never had cause, as a younger brother must have had,

to work his way through perplexities and dangers, as

in that casehe could not by practice have been made an

adept in the affair of government. But it was acciden­

tal, and owing, intirely to subsequent misfortunes, that
