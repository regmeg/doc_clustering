B.V. THE PELdPONNESlAN WAR. 35

misled them, promising to send an embassy of their* own

to Argos, to perfect the alliance.

But, in the mean time, it was judged to be previous­

ly expedient, that the Bœotian-rulers, and the Corin­

thians, and the Megareans, and the embassadors from

the allies of Thrace, should mutually interchange their

oaths, " to act in support of one another, if, upon an/

M occasion, such support might be requisite, and roen-

"ter neither into war nor peace without joint-consent;"

and then the Bœotians and Megareans (for these acted

in union) to form a league with the Argives. But, be­

fore such exchange of oaths, the Bœotian-rulers com­

councils, in whom the sovereignty is lodged; recom­

"ever cities were willing might mutually interchange

"such oaths for their reciprocal advantage." Yet the

Bœotians who composed the councils refused a confir­

mation; apprehensive it might tend to embroil them

with the Lacedæmonians, should they pledge such an

oath to the Corinthians, who were now abandoning the

Lacedæmonian interest: For the rulers had not made

them privy to the scheme from Lacedæmon, how

"Xenares and Cleobulus, of the college of Ephori,

*' and their friends, advise them, to enter first into  
"league with the Argives and Corinthians, and then

"to extend it to the Lacedæmonians." They had pre­

sumed that the supreme council, though they secreted

these lights, would not resolve against a plan which

themselves had pre-digested and recommended to them.

But now, as this affair took so wrong a turn, the Corin­

thians and embassadors from Thrace went home with­

out effect; and the Bœotian-rulers, who had .all along

intended, in case their scheme had passed, to persect an

alliance with the Argives, made no farther report to the

•councils in relation to the Afgives» sent no embassy to

Argos in consequence of thejnpromise^Jiiu, suffered the
