U4 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B. VI.

"well-proportioned to the design, since we know that we

"are bound to a land far remote from our own, and

"are under many disadvantages to grapple with our

"foes. It will not be now your employment to march

** to the relief of your dependents seated near to A-  
"thens against a hostile invasion, where all the needsul

supplies would be brought to your camp out of the

** territories of friends; but you are to roam to a dif-

"But what concerns us most is, to carry from hence

"that, which the Egesteans pretend is already laid up

"for our use, conclude it to be so only so far as words
