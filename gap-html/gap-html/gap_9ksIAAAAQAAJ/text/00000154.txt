others of the soldiery who attended him in the expedi­

tion, against whom informations had been given that

they were guilty of impiety in the affair of the Mysteries,

and against some of them in that of the Mercuries. For,

the Athenians, after the departure of the fleet, continu­

ed to make as strict an inquisition as ever into the crimes

committed in regard to the Mysteries, and also in regard

to the Mercuries. What fort of persons the informers

were was no part of their concern, but, in the height

of jealousy, giving credit indiscriminately to all,

through too great a deference to men of profligate and

abandoned lives, they apprehended and threw into prison

the most worthy citizens of Athens; esteeming it more

prudent by pains and tortures to detect the fact, than

that a person of irreproachable character, when once

accused through the villany of an informer, should

escape without the question. For, the people, having

learned by tradition how grievous the tyranny of Pisi-

modius, but by the industry of the Lacedæmoni­

ans; lived in a constant <iread of such another usur­

pation, and beheld all these incidents now with most

suspicious eyes. But, in fact, the bold attempt of Har-

inodius and Aristogiton, took its rife merely from a

competition in love. The particulars of which I shall

here unfold more largely, to convince the world, that

no other people, no not even the Athenians themselves,

have any certain account, either relating to their own,

tyrants or the transactions of that period. , ,

_ The truth is, that Pisistratus dying possessed of the

tyranny in a good old age, not Hipparchus (as is gene­

rally thought) but Hippias, the eldest of his sons, was

his successor in power. Harmodius being at this time

in the flower of his youth and beauty, Aristogiton a

citizen of Athens, nay a citizen of the middle rank,

doated upon and had him in his possession. But, some

attempts having been made upon,Harmodius, by Hip-
