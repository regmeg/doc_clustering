two thousand *min<s, at the rate of two minœ for every

heavy-armed soldier, agreeably to the letter of the law.

The Lacedæmonians, upon this, dispatched an cm-

bassy, to remonstrate against the injustice of the sen­

tence; that " the cessation had not been notified at La-

*' cedæmon when they threw in their heavy-armed."

The Eleans replied, that "the cessation was already

"in force: For they proclaim it first amongst them-

"selves i and so, whilst they were quiet, and expected

Yet the rest of the Grecians, except the Lepreatæ, were

admitted to assist at the solemnity.

The Eleans however, apprehensive they would sacri­

the temple. These were reinforced by the Argives and
