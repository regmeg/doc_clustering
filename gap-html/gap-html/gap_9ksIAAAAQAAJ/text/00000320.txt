3o8 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VIII.

But now, the Lesbians notifying again their readi­

ness to revolt, Astyochus, in a conference with Pæda-

ritus and the Chians, "maintains the necessity of go-

"ing thither with a squadron to support the revolt of

"Lesbos since, in consequence ot it, they must ei-

"ther enlarge the number of their confederates, or,

"even though miscarrying in the design, must hurt

"the Athenians-" But they were deaf to this remon­

strance; and Pædaritus positively declared that he

should not be attended by the ships of Chios. Upon

this, taking with him five fail of Corinthians, a sixth

ship belonging to Megara, and one more of Hermione,

and all the Laconjan which he himself brought thither,

he stood away from thence to his station at Miletus,

uttering grievous threats against the Chians, that,

"how low soever they might be reduced, they should

*' never receive any succour from him." Accordingly,  
touching fiist at Corycus of Erythræ, he moored there

for the night. The Athenians, who, from Samos,

with a considerable strength, were now bound against

Chios, were lying at the fame instant of time on the

other side of the cape, but so stationed that neither

party knew of the nearness of the other. At this junc­

ture, a letter being delivered from Pædaritus, that ;t a

"party of Erythræans, who had been prisoners at Sa-

"mos and released from thence, are coming to Ery-

"thræ to betray that place," Astyochus puts out a-

gain immediately for Erythræ; and thus narrowly, on

this occasion, d\d he escape falling into the hands of

the Athenians. Pædaritus, farther, had made the pas­

sage upon this affair; and both having joined in ma­

king all necessary enquiries about those who were accu­

sed of this piece of treachery, when they found the

whole to have been a plot of the prisoners at Samos

merely to recover their liberty, they pronounced them

innocent, and so departed; the latter to Chios; but the

other, in pursuance of his first designation, made the

best of his way to Miletus.
