296 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VIII.

** And, if any revolt from the Lacedæmonians and  
** consederates, be they declared enemies, in the fame  
** manner, to the king"

This alliance was now formally concluded.

Immediately after this, the Chians, who had manned

out ten additional Ihips, stood away to Anæa, being

desirous to pick up some information of what was doing

at Miletus, and at the fame time to cause the revolt os

the cities. Here, being reached by an order from Chal-

cideus to return back to Chios, with an intimation that

Amorges with a land-army would soon be upon them,

they sailed away to the temple of Jupiter. From hence

they descry sixteen ships, which Diomedon was bring­

ing up from Athens, from whence he had sailed some­

what later than Thrasycles. Upon this discovery they

fled amain with a single ship to Ephcsus, but with the

rest of their fleet to Teos. Four indeed of the num­

ber, which their crews had abandoned, the Athenians

take; yet all the hands escaped on shore; but the re­

mainder reach in safety the city of the Telans. After

this, the Athenians stood away into Samos, But the

Chians, putting again to sea with the residue of their

ships, arid attended by a land-force, caused Lebedosto

revolt, and also Eræ. And, these points carried, both

the land-force and the squadron returned respectively to

their own homes.

About the fame time, the twenty fail of Feloponne-

sians, which had been chased into Piræus, and lay

blocked up there by an equal number of Athenians,

having made an unexpected sally upon the enemy, and

got the better in a naval engagement, take four of the

Athenian ships; and, sailing away for Cenchreæ, were

again fitting put for the voyage to Chios and Ionia.

Astyochus also came down thither from Lacedæmon

as admiral, in whose hands the whole command at sea

was now lodged.
