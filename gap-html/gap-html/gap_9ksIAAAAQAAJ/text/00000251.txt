B.VII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 439

*' of such as -were only discretionary aids." He con­  
cluded with * the necessity they lay under, from the

*•' ties of duty, to continue the siege with vigour, and  
'* by no means expose a superior strength to ruin,

"through a false presumption that they were inferior

"in point'of supplies."

Nicias expressed himself on this occasion with an air

of neat confidence, as a person perfectly weli -acquaint­

ed with the stare of Syracuse and the failure'of money

there, and because there was a party within the city

which acted in favour of the Athenians, and had advi­

sed him, iby their agents, " by no means to raise the

"siege." 'And, what is more, he placed a stronger

dependence now upon the fleet than ever 'he had done

before the late unsuccessful engagement.

As to the proposal of continuing the siege, Demos­

thenes would not yield the least degree of attention to

it: " if ithe army must not evacuate Sicily without a

*.* peremptory order from Athens, but must persist in  
"this destructive service, he judged it would be better

"to draw them off to Thapsus or to Catana, where

M they might find opportunity enough to make incur-

** sions with the land-army upon the territories of the  
"enemy, and, by committing devastations, migbc

"highly distress them. Their fleet might then en-

*' gage 'n tne open sea; not in a space confined and  
"straitened, which was the greatest advantage to the

"enemy, but in sufficient sea-room, where all their'su-

*1 perior skill might fairly be exerted, where they  
"would be able to make their tacks, and bear down a-

*' gain upon the foe with greater agility, and more vio-  
"lent (hocks, than could be done in the limitary space

** of a close pent-up harbour. Upon the whole, he af-  
** firmed, that his consent should never be given to a  
"longer continuance in their present posts, but he was

"for moving off with all possible expedition, and they

*' had not a moment to lavish upon delay."  
( Eurymedon
