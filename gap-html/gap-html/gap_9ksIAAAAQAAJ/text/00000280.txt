268 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B. VII.

"life. Upon the strength of this, when I look for-

** wards to the future, my mind is enlivened with invi-  
"gorating hope; though I own these misfortunes, so

*' far undeserved, strike no little terror on my  
"thoughts. But better times, perhaps, may be ap-

*' proaching; for sure our enemies have been blessed  
<i with an ample measure of success; and, though some

*' deity may have frowned at first on this our expedi-  
** tion, yet by this time his wrath must be fully wreaked  
"upon us. We are not the first instance of a people

*' march be orderly and safe, be that the care of each  
"individual amongst your ranks, made warm and ear-

*' nest by the thought, â€” that, on whatever spot you  
"may be compelled to fight, on that, if crowned with

"victory, you regain a country and a bulwark of your

"own. But then, our march must be continued both day

*' and night, with unabating speed, because our stock  
"of provision is but scanty; and, can we but reach

"some friendly territory belonging to the Siculi, who,

"from their excessive diead of the Syracusans, will ever

"preserve their attachment to us, conclude yourselves

"that moment to be beyond the reach of danger:
