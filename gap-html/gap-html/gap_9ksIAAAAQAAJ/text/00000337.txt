gratiate himself with Tissaphernes. .

The Athenian deputies, with Pisander at their head,

who were sent from Samos, had no sooner reached A-

thens than they obtained an audience from the people;

where, after touching in a summary manner upon many

other advantages, they expatiated chiefly on this, that,

*' by recalling Alcibiades, and making an alteration in  
*' the democratical form of government, they might  
*' gain the friendship of the king and a superiority over  
*' the Peloponnesians." Large was the number of  
those who would not hear the proposal against the demo­

cracy. The enemies, farther, of Alcibiades were loud

in their clamours, that " shameful it would be if so

*' enormous a transgressor of the laws were recalled;  
*' one, to whose crimes, in point of the mysteries, the  
*' * Eumolpidæ and Ceryces had borne solemn attesta-  
"tion, the consequence of which was his exile; nay,

*' had, farther, denounced a curse upon those who  
*' should restore him." Pisander, interposing to put a  
stop to this violent opposition and these tragical out­

cries, addressed himself apart to each of these oppo­

"derate States, besides supplies of money from the

"king and Tissaphernes, whilst themselves were quite

"exhausted, unless somebody could persuade the king

*' to declare in their favour?" And when those, to  
whom the demand was put, replied in the negative, he

ryx. The former of them instituted the Eleusinian mysteries; and it was the
grand

privilege of his descendents to preside at and regulate those sacred rites.
Who Ce-

ryx was, and what the particular privileges of his descendents, any farther
than that

(according to Suidas) they weie holy and venerable," is not agreed. AU of them

were commanded to pronounce the fqjemn curse on Alcibiades when he was out­

lawed. Vet one priestess, (as Plutarch relates,) Theano, the daughter of
Menon,

refused to obey j alledging, that " it was her duty to Mess, and not to
curse."
