B.VII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. *n

of time,) they heightened the general distraction, and

clearly discovered their own word to the enemy. But

then they had not equal opportunities to discover that

of the enemy because, as the latter were now the vic­

tors and kept more in bodies, it was less liable to de­

party of the Athenians fell in with a weaker party of

their foes, yet they judged it best to fly; because they

with so much fury that they could not easily be parted.

The pursuit was briskly followed; in which many of

them, plunging headlong down the precipices, were

in safety to the camp: whereas, of the last comers,

some, straggling into by-ways, were bewildered in a

country to which they were utter strangers, and at break

of day were cut to pieces by the Syractnan horse, who
