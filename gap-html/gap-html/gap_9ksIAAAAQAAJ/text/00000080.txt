68 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.V,

the horse-guards, stiled The three hundreds falling upon

thoie troops which were composed of the elder Argives,

and them which are called the Pentelochi, and upon the

Gleoneans, and Orneatæ, and those Athenians who

ranked along with them, they broke them in an instant,

so that many of them durst not stand to exchange a blow,
