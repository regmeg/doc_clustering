B.VII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 203

*' darters, we have been forced to retire wirhin our in-  
** trenchments. Being therefore obliged, by the su-  
"perior numbers of the enemy, to discontinue our

*' circumvallation, we are this moment lying upon the  
"defensive. Nor indeed are we able to draw out our

"whole force for action, as detachments of our heavy-

*' armed are remotely employed in the guard of our  
"works. They have farther run up a single wall to

"cut our lines; so that there remains no longer a pos-

"sibility for us to complete the circumvallation, un-

"less, reinforced by a numerous body of troops, we

*.* are enabled to assault and demolish the counter-  
*' work. And, in consequence of this, we, who de-  
"signed to besiege others, may with much more pro-

** priety be said to suffer a siege ourselves, at least by  
"land: for we dare not make any distant excursions

*' into the adjacent country, for fear of the horse.

"What is more; they have sent embassadors to Pe-

*' loponnesus, to solicit reinforcements. Gy!ippus also  
"is making the tour of the Sicilian States, with a view

"to obtain the concurrence of such as are at present

*' neutral, and to prevail with the rest to intrust their  
*' additional levies for the service both of land and sea  
"under his command: and, according to my present

"intelligence, they are fully bent to attack, at one and

*' the same time, our intrenchments, with their land-  
** forces by land, and with their ships by sea. And,  
** though I say, by Sea, let not the iound be too ter-  
*' rible in your ears: for they know very well the pre-  
"sent state of our navy; which, though at first a most

complete equipment, for the cleanness of the ships

"and the health and vigour of the seamen, yet at pre-

"sent hath scarce a ship which is not leaky ; so long

** have they been necessitated to keep the sea, whilst  
** their hands have daily been mouldering away: for,  
*' in fact, we have no opportunity to lay them dry and  
"careen them; as we are under continual apprehen-

Â±* sions of being attacked by the ships of the enemy,
