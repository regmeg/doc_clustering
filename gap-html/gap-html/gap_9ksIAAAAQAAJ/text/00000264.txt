with a spirit worthy of that numerous strength of

which by ocular demonstration you see yourselves

this moment possssed'. Those points, of which we

perceive we may avail ourselves against the narrow­

ness of the harbour's mouth, against such a multi­

tude of vessels as will be crouded together, and

against that particular disposition of soldiers on their

decks, from which on the former occasion we suf­

fered so much, — all these, I must tell you, are as

well adjusted as our present condition will permit,

by the united care of us your generals and your own

masters: for many archers and darters shall now line

your decks, and that croud of soldiers, which, when

we engage in the open sea, we never can use, be­

cause the vessels would be too heavily laden to allow

the proper exertion of our skill; that croud, I say,

in this pent-up contracted space, shall give to our

naval battle the strength and stability of a land-

engagement. We have also devised the proper

means to compensate the inferior structure of our

ships; and, in return for the consolidated beaks of

our enemy, have provided the ships with grappling-

irons, which will hold fast a vessel that hath run a-

gainst you from getting clear, provided those on­

board will perform their duty: because, as necessity

inforceth us now to fight a mere land-battle from

our decks, it highly concerns us neither to be beat

off ourselves, nor to suffer them to get clear from

our grapple; especially when all the ambient shore,

excepting the small tract now occupied by our own

army, is hostile in regard to us. Mindful of these

things, it behoves you to fight it out so long as

strength and vigour shall enable you, and never suf­

fer yourselves to be driven on such a shore; but,

when once your ship hath grappled with a foe, never

once to think of losing your hold, till you have

cleared the enemy's decks of all the defendants.

But these points I give in charge to the heavy-armed,
