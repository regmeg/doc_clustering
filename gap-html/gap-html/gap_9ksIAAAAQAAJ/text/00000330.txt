making answer himself, instead of Tiffaphernes, that,

for instance, " the Chians were void of all shame;

"who, though the most wealthy of the Grecians, and

** hitherto preserved by the auxiliary efforts of others,  
"yet are ever requiring strangers to expose their lives

** and fortunes to keep them free." As for other  
States, he maintained "they acted basely, if, when

"subjected to vast expences before they revolted froth

"the Athenians, they refused to lay out as much, nay,

"a great deal more, in their own defence." He was

also dextrous at proving, that " Tiffaphernes, since

"now he supported the war at his own private ex-

** pence, was in the right to be frugal; but assuredly,  
"when returns were made him from the king, he

** would makeup the present abatement of pay, and do  
** strict justice to every single State." He farther sug­  
gested to Tiffaphernes, that "he should not be too

** much in a hurry to bring the war to a conclusion ; or  
** entertain the wish, either by bringing up the Phoe-  
** nician fleet which he had provided, or by taking in-  
** to pay a larger number of Grecians, to turn the supe-  
"riority at land and sea in favour of the Lacedæmo-

"nians. He ought rather to leave both parties pretty

"nearly balanced in strength; and fo enable the king,

** when one of them became troublesome, to let the o-  
** ther party loose against them: Whereas, should the  
** dominion in both elements be given exclusively to ei-  
"ther, he would then be distressed for want of susfi-

** cient power to pull down the triumphant State; un-  
"less, at a prodigious expence, and through infinity

** of danger to himself, he should choose to enter the  
* * lists in person and war them down. The risks incur-  
** red by the other method were far more eligible, be-  
** cause attended with a smaller proportion of expence  
* * and his master might lie by with persect security,  
** whilst he was wearing out the Grecians by their own  
** reciprocal embroilments." He moreover hinted to  
him, that " the Athenians were the best suited of the

** two
