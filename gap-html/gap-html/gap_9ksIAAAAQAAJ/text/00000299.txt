B.VIII. THE PELOP0NNES1AN WAR. a87

On this account it was, that the family of Alcibiades, in

compliment to this friendship, had taken a Lacedæmo­

nian name; for this Endius was the son of an Alcibiades.

Yet, previously, the Lacedæmonians dispatched Phry-

nis, a person born and educated in those parts, to Chi­

os, to inspect the state of afsairs there, and report, whe­

ther they had so large a number of stripping as they

pretended, and their situation in other respects equali­

zed the fine account they had given of it. Accordingly,

when Phrynis had reported, " that all the accounts

"they had heard were true," the Chians and Erythræ-

ans were instantly admitted allies. They voted, far­

ther, to fend them forty sail of shipping, as there were

already assembled at Chios not fewer than sixty from

places which the Chians named. Ten of these they de­

signed to dispatch, as soon as possible, under the com­

mand of Melanchridas, who was appointed admiral.

But afterwards, the shock of an earthquake being felt,

instead of Melanchridas they sent Chalcideus; and, in­

stead of ten, equipped in Laconia only five, ships for

this service.

Here the winter ended; and the nineteenth year

of this war came also to an end, of which Thucydides

hath compiled the history.

SUMMER now coming on, as the Chians were

most earnestly soliciting the dispatch of the ships, and

also afraid lest the Athenians should get notice of their

transactions,— for the whole of the negotiation had been

carried on without the knowledge of the latter, — the

Lacedæmonians fend to Corinth three citizens of Spar-

ra, to prevail with that State for the transportation of their

ships with all possible expedition across the isthmus,
