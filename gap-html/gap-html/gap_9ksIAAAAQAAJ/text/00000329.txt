B.VIII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 317

having laid their ships aground, continued with them

eighty days without subjecting them to any farther im­

position.

During this interval of time, nay, extended farther

back, before they undertook this enterprise against

Rhodes, the following transaction happened:

Alcibiades, after the death of Chalcideus and the bat­

tle of Miletus, falling under the suspicion of the Pelo-

ponnesians, and through them a letter having been sent

from Lacedæmon to Astyochus to put him to death, —

for he was an enemy to Agis, and his treachery in other

respects was become notorious, — Alcibiades, s say,

fearful of his life, withdraws himself first to Tissapher-

nes, and, in the next place, did all in his power to un­

dermine what interest the Peloponnesians had in him.

Grown at length his dictator in every affair, he abridged

their pay; that, instead of an Attic * drachma, three 0-

boli only should be given them, and that too with no

punctuality. He advised Tissaphernes to remonstrate

with them, that " the Athenians, who through a long

"tract of time had gained experience in naval affairs,

"paid only three oboli to their seamen, — not so much

tf through a principle of frugality, as to prevent their

** seamen from growing insolent through too much  
'* plenty; some of them would otherwise render their

'* bodies less fit for fatigue, by having wherewithal to

*c purchase those pleasures by which weakness is occa-  
"stoned; and others would desert, and leave their ar-

*' rears to balance their desertion." He instructed him,  
farther, how, by seasonable gratuities to the comman­

ders of ships and generals of the States, he might per­

suade them all to acquiesce in his proceedings, except­

ing the Syracusans; for, amongst these, Hermocrates

alone made loud remonstrances in behalf of the whole

alliance. Nay, Alcibiades himself took upon him to

give the denial to such States as petitioned lor money;

* Six oboli, or 7'/. \ Sterling.
