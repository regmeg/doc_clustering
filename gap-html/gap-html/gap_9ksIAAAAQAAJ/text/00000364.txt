352 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B. VIII.

ried in a spot of ground which the Lacedæmonians

who were amongst them had chose for his interment.

Whilst asfairs were thus sadly embroiled, between the

foldiery on one side, and Astyochus and Tissaphernes on

the other, Mindarus arrived from Lacedæmon, as suc­

cessor to Astyochus in the chief command of the fleer.

Accordingly he takes the command upon him, and

Astyochus sailed away for home. But with him, as

embassador, Tissaphernes sent one of his own creatures,

by name Gaulites, aCarian, who spoke both languages,

to accuse the Milesians about the seizure of the fort, and

also to make apologies for his conduct. He knew that

the Milesians were already set out with an outcry, chiefly

against him; and that Hermocrates was gone with

them, well armed with proofs that Tissaphernes, in

concert with Alcibiades, basfled all the Peloponnesian

schemes, and basely tampered with both the warring

parties. But an enmity had always subsisted between

these two about the payments of subsistence. And at

upon them the command of the Syracusan vessels,

(namely, Potamis, and Myscon, and Demarchus,)

against Hermocrates, now an exile; and, amongst his

other accusations of him, asfirmed, that " he had de-

"manded a sum of money, which being refused him,

"he had ever since declared himself his enemy." As­

tyochus, therefore, and the Milesians, and Hermo­

crates, are now sailed for Lacedæmon.

By this time also Alcibiades had repassed from Tissa­

phernes to Samos: And from Delos the deputation

lent from the four*hundred on the late revolution, to

soothe and gain the concurrence of those at Samos, ar­

rive also whilst Alcibiades is there. Upon which, an

assembly being called, they endeavoured to open the

cause. The soldiers at first refused to hear them, and

ioared aloud for the murder of those who had over­
