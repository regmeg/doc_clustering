226 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VII.

within and without, in the softie manner as the Corinthi­

ans had strengthened the wholeprow of their ships for the

last naval engagement against the squadron atNaupactus.

By thele means the Syracusans coricluded they should

gain an advantage over the ships of the Athenians,

which were of a different 'structure, as in the prow they

were but weak, because of their usual practice, in an

engagement, not to charge a-head, biit by tacking a-

bout (o strike upon the sides : — that, sarther, should

the battle be fought in the great harbour, where sea-

room would be small and the ships be crouded, this must

be also an advantage in their favour since, dariing

themselves a-head, they must needs shatter the prows

of the enemy, when with compact and solid beaks rJhey

struck against such as were hollow and weak : — that

again, for want of sea-room, the Athenians would be

too ftiuch straitened to make their tacks, or to run

through their lines, which were points of art on which

they chiefly relied j they were determined to the utmost

of their power to check all attempts of the latter sort,

and the narrow space in which they must engage would

of itself prevent the former; and now they intended

with dexterity to tufn to their own advantage the me­

thod of striking a-head, which on the former occasion

appeared to be an error in the masters; that hence in­

fallibly the day must be their own j for the Athenians,

if once repulsed, would not have room to go round and

return to the charge, since thus they must directly be

forced on the shore, which lay but a small distance from

their camp and would sadly cramp them up; that they

themielves must be masters of the rest of the harbour,

whilst'the enemy, crouded together, in case they should

be forced to give'way, must be driven into narrow

compass, and even, falling soul on one another, a total

cons usion and disorder must certainly follow; for, what

hurt the Athenians most, in all their naval engagements,

was their inability to make use of the whole harbour for

tacking about or returning to the charge, in the same

, . manner
