Ij4 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VI.

The Athenians, with the reinforcements of their al­

lies, were by this time all arrived at Corcyra. And the

first thing done by the commanders was, to take a re­

view of the whole equipment, and to settle the order

in which they were to anchor and form their naval sta-,

tion. They also divided it into three squadrons, and

cast lots for the command of each; to the end that, in

the course of the voyage, they might be well supplied

with water, and harbours, and the proper necessaries,

wherever they might chance to put in; that, in other

respects, a better discipline might be kept up, and the

men be more inured to a ready obedience, as being under the

inspection of an able commander in each several division.

These points being settled, they dispatched three vessels

to Italy and Sicily, to pick up informations, what cities

on those coasts would give them a reception. And their

orders were, to come back in time and meet them upon

the voyage, that they might be advertised into what

ports they might safely enter.

These previous points being adjusted, the Athenians,

with an equipment already swelled to so great a bulk,

weighing anchor from Corcyra, stood across for Sicily.

The total of their triremes was a hundred and thirty-

four, to which were added two Rhodian vessels of fifty

oars. One hundred of these were Athenian, and, of this

number, sixty were tight ships fit for service; the rest

were transports for the soldiery. The remainder of the

fleet consisted of Chians and the other allies. The total

of the heavy-armed on-board was five thousand one

hundred men. Of these, fifteen hundred were citizens

of Athens inrolled; seven hundred were Athenians of

the lowest class, (called Tbetes,) who served by way of

marines. The rest of the force consisted of the quotas

of their alliance; some, of their own dependents; five

hundred belonged to the Argives; the number of Man-

tineans and mercenaries was two hundred and fifty; the

archers in the whole amounted to four hundred and

eighty;
