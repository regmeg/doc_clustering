254 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B/VII.

** there will no longer be able to repulse the united as-  
"faults of their domestic foes and such foreign inva-

"ders. Nay, the infallible result must be, that you at

** once put on the chains of Syracusans, against whom  
** you are conscious with what intentions you at first

made provision to counterwork that project. For this

purpose, they had covered the prows and almost the

whole gunnel of their ships with hides; that, when the

grappling-iron was thrown, it might slip off and catch

no hold. And no fooner were all their preparations

completed, than the Syracusan generals, in concert with

Gylippus,
