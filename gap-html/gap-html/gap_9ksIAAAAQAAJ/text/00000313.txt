B.VI1I. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 301

from Erythræ, they consulted how to prevent the exe­

cution of the plot by the mildest and most gentle me­

thods, either by taking hostages for the sidelity of the

suspected, or some other such cautionary expedients.

In this posture stood affairs at Chios.

But, from Athens, in the close of the same summer,

one thousand five hundred heavy-armed Athenians and

a thousand Argives, (for, five hundred Argives, who

were but light-armed, the Athenians had equipped in

of Miletus. It is observable, that, in this battle, the

Ionians had on both sides the better of the Dorians: For
