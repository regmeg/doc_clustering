3co THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VIII.

and at Bolissus, having routed in battle a body of Chi-

ans that made head against them, and done great exe­

cution upon them, they reduced all the places in that

quarter of the island. At Phanæ also they fought a se­

cond time with great success; and, a third time, at Leu-

one of those cases inseparable from the constant muta­

in the fame mistake with themselves, who yet in their

judgement were perfectly convinced that the entire ruin

of Athens was fast approaching.

Now, therefore, blocked up as they were by sea,

whilst their lands all around were ravaged by the ene­

of delivering up the city into the hands of the Athe­

nians. But those in the administration, getting wind of

their design, refrained indeed from making a bustle a-

bout it in public; but, fetching over Astyochus, the

Lacedæmonian admiral in chief, with his four ships,
