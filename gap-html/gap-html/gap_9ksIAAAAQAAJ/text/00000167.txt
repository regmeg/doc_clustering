them, they again retreated: And, having crossed the.

road to Heiorum, reposed themselves for the night.

The succeeding day, the Athenians and allies pre­

pared for engagement, and their order of battle was

formed, as follows: — The Argives and Mantineans

had the right, the Athenians the center, and the rest of

the line was formed by the other confederates. One

half of the whole force, which was ranged in the first

line, was drawn up by eight in depth. The other half,

being potted near the tents, formed a hallow square, in

which the men were also drawn up by eight. The latter

were ordered, if any part of the line gave way, to keep

a good look out and advance to their support. And

within this hallow square they posted all the train who at­

tended the service of the army.

But the Syracusans drew up their heavy-armed,

which body consisted of the whole military strength of

Syracuse and all the confederates who had joined them,

in files consisting of sixteen. Those, who had joined

with auxiliary quotas, were chiefly the Selinuntians; and

next, she horse of the Geloans, amounting in the whole

to about two hundred: The horse also of the Camari-

neans, about twenty in number, and about fifty archers.

But their horsemen they posted to the right, being not

fewer in number than twelve hundred; and, next to

them, the darters.

The Athenians being now intent on advancing to the

charge, Micias, addressing himlelf in regular order to

the troops of the several States, animated them to the

fight by the following harangue, repeated in turn to the

whole army.
