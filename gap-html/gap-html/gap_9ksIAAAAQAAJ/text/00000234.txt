82t THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.Vfl,

The embassadors from Syracuse, who were sent round

to the Sicilian cities after the surprisal of Plemmyrium,

had succeeded in their negotiations; and, having as­

sembled a large body of succours, were intent on bring­

ing them up. Nicias, who had gained an early intel­

ligence of their motion, sends to such of the Siculi as

lay upon their route and were in his alliance, (namely,

the Centoripes and Halycyæans and others, " by no

*' means to yield a free passage to the enemy, but to  
*' assemble in a body and obstruct their march." It  
was impossible for them to reach Syracuse by any other

route; for the Agrigentines had refused them a passage

through their territories. Now, therefore, the Sicili­

ans being on their march, the Siculi, in compliance

with the request of the Athenians, had placed three

different ambuscades in their way. From these rustl­

ing suddenly upon them, as they were advancing in a

careless manner, they destroyed about eight hundred

men, and all the embassadors, excepting one Corin­

thian. And this Corinthian brought up afterwards to

Syracuse all those who escaped by flight, the number

of whom amounted to fifteen hundred.

About the same time the Camarineans also send up a

body of succours, consisting of five hundred heavy-

armed, three hundred darters, and three hundred ar­

chers. The Geloans also sent them a squadron of about

five sail, beside four hundred darters and two hundred

horsemen.

Now almost all Sicily except the Agrigentines, (for

these still adhered to their neutrality,) all the rest of the

island, I say, who hitherto had stood aloof to observe

events, united themselves against the Athenians, in be­

half of Syracuse: though the Syracusans, after the

blow they had just received from the Siculi, thought

it not proper to attack the Athenians again upon a sud­

den.

But Demosthenes and Eurymedon, having now com­

pleted their embarkations at Corey ra and on the conti­

nent,
