282 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VIII.

to the will of heaven, had elevated their hopes with the

certain conquest of Sicily. On all sides now all manner

of disasters environed them about; and never had A*

thens been thrown into so great a consternation and de­

jection as at the present juncture: For now, beside

what each private family suffered, as the public at the

fame time had lost the bulk of its heavy-armed and

horsemen, and that flower of its youth which they saw it

impossible to replace, they were sorely dejected. Con­

scious, farther, that they had not shipping sufficient in

their docks for a fresti equipment, nor money in the

public treasury, nor even hands to man what vessels

they had left, they gave up all hope of deliverance in

the present plunge. Their enemies from Sicily, they i-

magined, would soon enter the Piræus with a powerful

navy, especially as they were flushed with such a career

of success; and their enemies nearer home would

now, for a certainty, redouble their preparations, and

with the utmost resolution fall upon them at once both

by sea and land, and be farther strengthened by the re­

volt of their own temporising confederates. At last,

however, they agreed it was their duty to do what might

yet be done; not basely to abandon their own preier-

vation, but to fit out a navy, by collecting from all

possible resources both timber and money ;—and timely

to secure their own dependent States, above all Eubœa;

— and to reduce the expences of the civil administration

with all possible ceconomy; — and to lodge the sove­

reignty in the hands of a select body of old experienced

statesmen, whose maturer counsels might, if possible, yet

extricate the State from its present misfortunes. Such

an effect had the general consternation now upon them*

an effect not unusual with a peepk, that they became

heartily disposed to order their government aright.

And, as to such resolutions they came, they proceeded,

farther, to put them in execution: And the summer

ended.
