B.VIII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 333

encouraging the men of power amongst the Athenians

to join their efforts with them for the erection of an

oligarchy, though a party was very busy in opposing

them, with a view to quash the projected alteration.

The Athenians, farther, at Samos had in private con­
