time provinces of Asia. Even Tissaphernes concerned

himself now to inflame the Peloponnesian ardour, and

promised them larpe supplies. For lately he had been

summoned by the king to make returns of the revenue

of his government; which not being able to exact from

the Grecian cities, because of the Athenians, he was run

into a large arrear. He concluded, therefore, that,

could he demolish the Athenians, he then with great

ease might levy the tributes; what is more, might make

the Lacedæmonians confederates to the king; and might

at length convey to him, either aiive or dead, Amor-

ges, the bastard-son of Pissuthnes, who had revolted in

Caria, as the king had expressly commanded. The

Chians, therefore, and Tissaphernes, were now nego­

tiating this point in concert.

Calligitus, the son of Laophon, a Megarean, and Ti-

magoras, the son of Athenagoras, a Cyzicene, both ex­

iles from their native places, and refuged with Phar-

nabazus, the son of Pharnabacus, arrive at Lacedæmon

about the same point of time, commissioned by Pharna-

bazus to procure an aid of (hipping for the Hellespont,

by which he might be enabled (the very same thing as

Tissaphernes desired) to work the revolt of the cities

within his district from the Athenian obedience, be­

cause of the tributes, and expeditioufly to gain for him­

self the credit of having procured for his master the al­

liance of the Lacedæmonians. As the agents of Phar-

nabazus and those also of Tissaphernes were negotiating

the same point; though apart from each other, a great de­

bate arose among the statesmen at Lacedæmon; one

party insisting, with vehemence, that an aid of shipping

, and a land force should be sent toTonia and Chios; an­

other party, that they should be sent first to Hellespont.

The Lacedæmonians, however, complied by far the soon­

est with the demands of the Chians and Tissaphernes. Al-

cibiades, indeed, espoused the cause of the latter, from

an extraordinary zeal to mark hereditary friendship toEn-

dius,whoat thisjuncturepresided in thecollege oiEfbori.
