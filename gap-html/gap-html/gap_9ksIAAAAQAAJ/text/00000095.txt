B>V, THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 8j

Athenians..

*' THAT never can be: Since from States seated on  
** the continent we have nothing to apprehend they  
** are under no immediate necessity of guarding their li-  
"berty against attacks from us. Those alone we dread

■* who are seated in islands; and who, like you, refuse

** our government; or who, having felt the pains  
** of subjection, are irritated against us. Such are most  
** likely to have recourse to violent measures, and to  
** plunge themselves aqd us into imminent dangers."

** IF this be so k,---and if you, ye Athenians, can rea-  
** dily embark into so many perils to prevent die diffo-  
*' lution of your own empire; if States, by you insla-  
** ved, can do as much to throw off your yoke ; —*  
f* must it not be Wretchedly base and cowardly in us,

** who yet are free, to leave any method, even to the  
** last extremity, untried, of averting stavtery?"

** present concerned, is not a trial of valour upon equal  
terms, in order to escape the reproach of cowardice;

but your deliberations proceed at present about the

means of self-preservation, that you may not be obli-

*' ged to encounter those who must by far overpower  
** you." •:

"BUT we, on the contrary, know, that the entef-

** prizes of war have sometimes very different events
