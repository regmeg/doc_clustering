B.VI. THE PEI.OPONNESIAN WAR. 1+3

The latter received the account with all that anguish

which a warm affection fee|s; and, alarmed at the

great power of Hipparchus, lest by force he might seize

the youth, he instantly forms a project, a project as

inlarge the altar in the forum, by that means effaced

xhe inscription: But that in the Pythian is yet legible,

though the letters are wearing out apace, and runs
