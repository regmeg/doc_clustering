i78 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VI.

"that the judicious part of our community are sensible

"what fort of a government a democracy is, — and I

** myself no less than others, who have such abundant  
*' occasion to reproach and curse it: — but, for mad-  
"ness open and avowed, new terms of abhorrence can-

*' not be invented; though totally to subvert it we  
*' could in no wise deem a measure of security, whilst  
*' you had declared yourselves our foes, and were in the  
*' field against us. And all those proceedings of mine,  
"which have proved most offensive to you, are to be

"charged entirely to such principles as these.

** And now, in relation to these points, on which

"Sicilians to our yoke. After them, we intended to

"do the same by the Italians. We should next have

"attempted the dominions of the Carthaginians; nay,

*' Carthage itself. Had these our views been succes-  
"ful, eithes in the whole or the greater part, we

*' should soon have given the attack to Peloponnesus;  
"assembling for that purpose the whole Grecian force,

*' which the countries thus subdued must have added to  
*' our own; taking also into our pay large bodies of  
** Barbarians and Iberians, and other soldiers of those  
*' nations which by general consent are famed for the  
"most warlike of all Barbarians. We should have

"built also great numbers of triremes for the enlarge-

"ment of our navy, as Italy would plentifully have

*' supplied us with timber; with which blocking up  
*' Peloponnesus on all sides, and with our land-forces  
*' at the same time invading it by land, (after carrying  
"your cities, some by storm, and some by the regular

*' siege,) we hoped without obstruction to have warred  
"you down, and in pursuance of that to have seized

*' the empire of universal Greece. With money and all

"needful
