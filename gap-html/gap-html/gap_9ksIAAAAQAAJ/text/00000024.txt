12 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.V.

to shew their high respect fdr the Lacedæmonian a!li-

'ance, as they stood in great dread of the Athenians.

For, considering their hostile embroilments with the

Athenians, they thought it neither for their interest nor

satisfaction to continue the honours of Agnon.

To the Athenians they also delivered the bodies of

their dead. The number of them, on the Athenian

side, amounted to six hundred, whereas the enemy lost

but seven men. This was owing to the nature of the

fight, which had not been carried on in a regularvman-

ner, but was rather a Daughter, in consequence of a

surprise and sudden consternation. After the reception

of cheir dead, the Athenians sailed away for Athens;

but those under the orders of Clearidas applied them­

selves to re-settle and secure Amphipolis.

About the same time, in the close of this summer,

Ramphias, and Autocharidas, and Epicydidas, Lace­

dæmonians, were conducting up, for the Thracian ser­

vice, a reinforcement consisting of nine hundred heavy-

armed. Being arrived at Heraclea, in Trachis, they

regulated there such things as seemed to require an a-

mendment; and, during the season they halted here,

the battle of Amphipolis was fought, and the summer

ended.

But, early as possible in the succeeding winter, the

reinforcement under Ramphias proceeded on their route

as far as Pierium of Thessaly. But, the Thessalians op­

posing their farther passage, and Brasidas being now

dead, to whom they were conducting this supply, they

returned home. They imagined that their aid was no

longer wanting, as the Athenians, in consequence of

their overthrow, had quitted that country, and them­

selves had not sufficient ability to carry the plans into

execution which Brasidas had been meditating. But the

principal motive of their return was their own conscious­

ness, at setting out, that the Lacedæmonians were more

inclined to peace.
