B:VII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 357

"themselves upon the decision of fortune; that either,

*' if the passage can be forced, they may launch out to  
*' sea; or, that project sailing, may attempt a retreat  
"by land;—as if to a worse condition than their present

** it were not in the power of fortune to reduce them.  
*' Warmed, therefore, with brave resentment, let us  
*' also try the encounter against such wild confusion,  
** and against the fortune of our inveterate foes now  
*' treacherously bent to finish their destruction. Let us  
*' charge with the full conviction, that on an enemy,  
** who would justify their invasion on the principle  
"of redressing wrongs, it is most fair and equitable to

** satiate all the fury of revenge; nay more, that ven-  
*' geance on a foe is an appetite of our nature, and  
** commonly said to be the sweetest of all human enjoy-

"and children the most indecent enormities, and on

"Syracuse the most ignominious appellation. In a

** But 10 us, could we execute the fair and equitable  
"wishes of our hearts, by inflicting upon them the pu-

*f nishment they well deserve, and in setcing the liberty

'* yond the reach of any future insults, how glorious

'* must such achievements be! For such critical mo-

"merits of adventure are most rarely to be met with;

"which, if unsuccessful, can do the least disservices

*' but, if*successful, draw after them the most valuable  
*' acquisitions." '-'
