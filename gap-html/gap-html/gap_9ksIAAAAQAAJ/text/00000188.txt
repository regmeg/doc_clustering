176 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VI.

monians " to declare open war at home against the

** Athenians, and to fit out an aid for the service of  
* * Sicily."

At the time that these joint-embassies arrived at La­

cedæmon from Corinth, Alcibiades was also there.

He had no sooner made his escape, attended by his

companions in exile, than in a trading-vessel he pasted

over from Thuria to Cyllene in Elea; and from thence

he repaired to Lacedæmon. But, as the Lacedæmo­

nians had pressed to see him, he went thither under the

protection of the public faith; for he had with reason

dreaded his reception there, since he had acted so large

a part in the affair of Mantinea.

It happened farther, that, when a public assembly

was convened at Sparta, the Corinthians, and the Sy-

racusans, and Alcibiades, all urged the fame request,

and were successful. Nay, though the College of E-

phori,and those who presided at the helm os theStaie,had

dressed up a plan, in pursuance of which they were on­

ly to send their embassadors to Syracuse, to hinder all

accommodations with the Athenians, and were quite a-

verle to the supplying them with real succours,—yet Al­

cibiades, standing up, inflamed the Lacedæmonian fu­

harangue:

"I LIE under a necessity, in the beginning of my

"discourse, to vindicate myself srom the calumny

** which hath been charged against me, lest a jealousy  
"of me might divert your attention from those points

"which equally affect the common cause. My ances-

"tors, therefore, having, upon some reasonable

"grounds of complaint, renounced the privilege of be-

** ing the public hosts of your embassies at Athens, I  
1* am the man who again re-established this hospitable

"intercourse; who in many other respects endeavour*

** ed with great assiduity to oblige you, and particular*  
*.* ly in the calamity which fell to your share at Pylus.
