'&+ THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.V,

in magnifying their own strength, hath been still difbe-*

lieved. However, from the following computation, an

inquirer may discover the number of the Lacedæmoni­

ans, who on this occasion were drawn up in the field.

Besides the Skiritæ, who were in humber six hundred,

seven battalions were in this engagement. 'Now in eve­

ry battalion there were four companies; and, in every

company, four platoons; in the first rank of every platoon.

were four fighting soldiers. In regard to depth they

were not equally formed, as every colonel determined

the depth at his own private discretion; but generally

they were drawn up eight deep. The front-line of their

whole force, excepting the Skiritæ, consisted of four

hundred and forty-eight men.-f

When both sides were ready, the small respite before

the engagement was employed by the several comman­

ders in animating the soldiers under their respective or­

ders.

To the Mantineans it was urged, That " the

"points, for which they were going to fight, were

"their country and their future fate, either rule or fla-

"very; that of rule, whose sweets they had known,

"they might not be divested, and that they might ne-

"ver feel again what slavery is."

To the Argives, It was "for their ancient so-

"vereignty, and the equal fliare of dignity they had

*' once enjoyed in Peloponnesus, now timely to prevent  
"an eternal submission to such losses, and earn revenge

and each tnomatia, or platoon, consisted of 32. This is the account of
Thucydides,

who computes the platoon by 4 in front and 8 in depth. The platoon consisted
there­

fore of 32 f which, X by 4, = 128, the number of a company; which, also X

by 4, ~ 512, the number of a battalion. The number of battalions was seven,

which shews the number of Lacedæmonians to have been 3584; and then, with the-

addition of 600 Siirittr, who were posted on the left, to have amounted, in
the whore,

to 4184 men. Or again, the whole front line, = 448, X 8, the number in depth,

is equal to 3584, +600 Skiritæ, = 4184.
