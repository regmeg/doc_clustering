B.VIII. THE PELOP.GNNESIAN WAR. 343

jured "not to look' calmly on till their destruction

should be completed, and Samos rent away from the

** Athenians, by which alone till now their empire had  
** been preserved and supported." Listening, there­  
fore, to these representations, they privately exhorted

every single soldier not to suffer such proceedings; and

more earnestly than others the Paralian, .since ail that

sailed in that vessel were citizens of Athens, a)l free,

find enemies determined, from time immemorial, to an

oligarchy, even when it had no existence. Leon also

and Diomedon never went out to sea without leaving

them some ships for their guard; insomuch that, when

the three hundred made their attempt, as all these united

.in their obstruction, but most heartily of all the Para-

Mans, the popular party at Samos was rescued from de­

struction. Thirty of those three hundred they even

slaughtered, and three .of .the most factious amongst the

iurviyars they doomed to banishment. Then, havings

published an indemnity for the rest, they continued to

.support she democracy at Samos.

But the Samians and soldiery dispatch the Paralus

•with ail expedition to Athens, having on-board her

Chæreas, the ion,of Achestratus, an Athenian, who had

borne a canGderable share in the last .turn of affaii s*

-charged with a .notification of these last transactions;  
for yet it .was not known at Samos that .the four hun­

dred ihad seized .the administration. No sooner, there­

fore, were they come <to -their moorings, than the four

hundred .caused twp.or three .of the crew of the P<2ra/w to

.be dragged .away to prison; the residue they turned over

-from that vessel into another ship of war, and ordered  
.che^n away as a guard-ship for the station of Eubœa.

But .Ctiæreas, sensible .in what train affairs were going,

ijiad ^he good fortune to make his escape; and, return­

ing again to Saraos^ related to the soldiery all that had

been done in Athens, exaggerating every point with a-
