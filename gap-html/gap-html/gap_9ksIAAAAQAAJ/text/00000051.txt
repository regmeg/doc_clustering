B.V. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 39

Whilst: the Argives were employed in this negotia­

tion, the Lacedæmonian embassadors, Andromenes, and

Phædimus, and Antimenidas, who were commissioned

to receive Panactum and the prisoners of war from the

Bœotians, and deliver them over into the hands of the

Athenians, found, upon their arrival, that Panactum

was already demolished by the Bœotians, upon prettxc

that, " in former times, upon occasion of some dispute

about it, an oath had been taken, by the Athenians

"and Bœotians, that neither should inhabit that place,

"excluding the other, but should jointly possess it

but what Athenian prisoners of war were in the hands

of the Bœotians were delivered up to Andromenes and

his collegues, who carried and released them to the A-

thenians. They also reported the demolition of Panac­

tum, declaring this to be equivalent to a restitution, as

no enemy to Athens could occupy that post for the fu­

ture.

These words were no sooner heard than the Athe­

nians conceived the deepest resentments. They thought

themselves injured by the Lacedæmonians, not only in

the demolition of Panactum, which ought to have been

restored standing, but also in the separate alliance made

lately with the Bœotians, of which they now had no­

tice, in open contradiction to their own declaration,

** of joining them to compel by force such as would noc  
"accede to the treaty." They reflected also upon o-

ther points in which the engagements of the treaty had

been in no wife fulfilled, and concluded themselves o-

verreached. For these reasons, they gave a rough an­

swer to the embassadors, and an instant dismission.

Upon so much umbrage, taken by the Athenians a-

gainst the Lacedæmonians, such persons at Athens, as

were willing to dissolve the peace, set themselves in­

stantly at work to accomplish their views. Others were

labouring the fame point, but none more than Alcibu-
