58 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.V,

On the other part also, the Argives were still much,

more exasperated against those, who had made this sus­

pension without public authority. They imagined the

Lacedæmonians had escaped them, when they had the

finest opportunity of striking a blow, inasmuch as the

contest must have been decided under the very walls of

Argos, and in company with a numerous and gallant

alliance. And hence, upon their return, at the Chara*

drum, the place where the crimes committed in an ex­

the Argives, though they stayed behind at first, were

persuaded by such reasoning, and soon after went also

to take part in the expedition. Thus united, they sat

down before and besieged Orchomenus. They made

several assaults upon it, desirous for other reasons to get
