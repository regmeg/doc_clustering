B.VII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 273

with them about the hour of repast: And, as they sett

in first with the column under the orders of Demosthe­

nes, which composed the rear, and had moved in a

more flow and disorderly manner than the van, because

the darkness of the night had so highly incommoded

and confounded their march, they immediately charged

them and fought. The Syracusan cavalry beset them

quite round, (the more easily, indeed, as they were se­

parated from the van,) and drove them into one crouded

heap. But the column under Nicias was now * fifty

stadia before them; for Nicias led them forwards with

great celerity, concluding that their sasety consisted, not

in lingering voluntarily at so critical a period, or expo­

sing themselves to an engagement, but in pushing for­

wards with their utmost speed, and fightingonly when by

absolute necessity they were compelled to fight. But

then Demosthenes was involved in a much more labo­

rious and continued toil; because, as he filed off last,

the enemies were left upon his rear; and, soon con­

vinced that they had begun the pursuit, he was obli­

ged, not so much to move forward, as to draw up his

troops in the order of battle, till by such necessitated

lingering he is environed by them, and himself and the

body of Athenians under him are thrown into high tu­

mult and confusion. For now, hemmed in as they

were on a certain spot, surrounded quite round by walls,

and whence the issues both on one side and the other

were full of olive-trees, they were terribly galled on

their flanks by the darts of the enemy. This kind of

annoyance the Syracuians wisely chose to give them, and

to decline all close engagement; because, to hazard the

latter against enemies now become quite desperate, they

judged would make more for the advantage of the A-

thenians than of themselves: Though, at the same time,

a kind of frugality, inspired by the great career of suc­

cess they had already obtained, taught them not to ex­

haust their strength on superfluous encounters, and per-

* Above five miles.
