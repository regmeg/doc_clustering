B.VII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 267

began the voyage, were now dislodging with omens that

portended nothing but misery: Those, farther, who

came hither as lords of the ocean, were now stealing

away by land, from henceforth to be saved, not by

naval skill, but the perseverance of a land-army. How*

ever, ail these reflexions put their patience nothing on

the stretch, in comparison of that weight of misery

which this very instant was hovering over their heads.

Nicias, perceiving the whole army to be overwhelmed

in despair and sunk in this plunge of distress, addressed

himself severally to the troops, exhorted, and com­

forted, by every topic which occurred, each single

party, whom he visited by turns, elevating his voice

far beyond the ordinary pitch, to suit the earnestness of

his heart, in hope that, the louder he spoke, the more

extensive effect it might have upon the hearers.

"EVEN yet, and in the present low ebb of our

** fortune, my dear countrymen and consederates, we  
** ought to encourage hope. Instances may be given  
"of armies who have been rescued from a deeper

** plunge of dangers than that which is now our por-  
** tion. Nor ought you to torture yourselves with too  
** painful regret at what you suffer, or at the unme-  
** rited miseries which this moment environ you abour.

Even I myself, who have much less room to boast

"of a constitution superior to hardships than the meanest

"soldier in your ranks, (for your own eyes can witness

** to how low a state my bodily infirmities have redu-  
"ced me,) who, however, in the continued happi-

*.* ness of my former course of lise, or in any other re-  
** gard, am inserior to none amongst you, — yet am  
** bufseted now, by the storms and outrages of fortune,  
** as cruelly as ever were the vilest and most abject of  
** my sellow-creatures. It is true, I have ever habitu-  
"ally worshipped the gods, with a conscientious de-

"ference to established laws; and have made justice

** and beneficence to man the constant practice of my  
V- ' ~ "life.
