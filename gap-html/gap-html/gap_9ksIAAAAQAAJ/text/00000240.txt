228 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VII.

Great parr of this day was spent in advancing to­

wards, and retiring from, one another, and in recipro­

cal endeavours to seize advantages; but neither side

was able to execute any remarkable piece of service,

excepting that the Syracusans lunk one or two of the

Athenian ships; upon which they parted, and at the

fame time the land-army drew off from the intrench-

ments.

The day following the Syracusans lay quiet, asford­

ing the entmy no room to guess at their future designs.

But Nicias, conscious to himself that hitherto no ad­

vantages had been gained by sea, and fully expecting

that the enemy would repeat their attempt, obliged the

captains of the triremes to repair their ships if any wife

damaged, and stationed ihe transports before the piles,

which they had driven down in the sea, to secure the

ships, and lock up as it were that space in which they

lay. The transports he ranged in a line, at the distance

of the breadth of two * plethra from one another; that,

in case a ship was repulsed, it might run in hither as a

.place of scqurity, and might again stand out without

any molestation. In persecting these dispositions the

'Athenians were all this day employed from morning to

nighf.

The next day, the Syracusans, earlier in the morn­

ing than before, and with the fame parade of their land

and naval force, came out to attack the Athenians.

Now again, facing each other in the lines of engage­

ment, they spent great part of the day in the same en-

, deavours as before to over-reach and surprise one ano­

ther; till, at length, Aristo, the son of Pyrricus, a

Corinthian, and the most expert seaman in the fleet of

Syracuse, persuades the commanders of that fleet to

dispatch their orders to the magistrates within the city,—

"with all expedition to bring the provisions which

"were for sale down to the beach of the sea, and hold

"the market there; nay, farther, to compel all those
