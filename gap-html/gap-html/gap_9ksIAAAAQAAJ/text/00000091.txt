B.V. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAI*. 99

"low your plea, from that moment we become your

"slaves."

Athenian s.

"TO what purpose this? If here you are met to-

*' gether to retail your suspicions of future events, or to  
"talk of any thing but the proper means of extricating

"and preserving your State from the present and mani-

*' fest dangers which environ it, we had better be si-  
"lent: But, if the latter be your purpose, let us come

*' to the point." .

Melians.

"T H E R E is reason for it, and there ought to be

*' forgiveness, when men, so situated as we are, are li-  
** able to much distraction both in speech and thought.

The point for which we are assembled is, it is true,

"no less than our future preservation: If, therefore,

"it must be so, let the conference proceed in the me-

"thod you require."

Athenians.

** AS, therefore, it is not our purpose to amuse you  
"with pompous details, — how, after completely van-

'* quishing the Mede, we had a right to assume the so-

"vereignty, or how, provoked by the wrongs received

"from you, we come hither to earn redress,— we shall

tc wave all parade of words that have no tendency to-

*' wards conviction: And, in return, insist from you,  
"that you reject all hopes of persuading us by frivo-

** lous remonstrances, — that, as a colony of the Lace-  
** dæmonians, you were incapacitated from accompa-  
"nying our arms, or that wrongs in any fliape you'

** have never done us. — But, these things apart, Ictus  
*' lay all stress on such points as may really on both

*' sides
