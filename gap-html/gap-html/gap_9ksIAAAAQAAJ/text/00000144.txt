132 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VI.

** but an oligarchy means only a party; in the next place,  
*' that men of opulence are the most suitable guardians  
*' of the public treasure; that men of understanding  
*' and experience are best qualified to advise; but the  
*' many, after hearing, are the best judges of measures.  
*' And thus, by a democracy, equality of right and of  
** privilege is most fairly preserved, as well to the
