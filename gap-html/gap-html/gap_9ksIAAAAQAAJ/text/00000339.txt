B. VIH. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 327

vernment; and, after adjusting all previous measures

to guard the best against dilatory proceedings — re-

passeth the sea to Tissaphernes, accompanied by his ten

associates in the deputation.

In the fame winter, Leon and Diomedon, being ar­

rived at their post, at the head of the Athenian fleet,

made an expedition against Rhodes; and there they find

the ships of the Peloponnesians hauled ashore. They

made a descent upon the coast; and, after defeating in

battle such of the Rhodians as made head against them,

they stood away for Chalce, and for the future carried

But at Rhodes arrived Xenophantidas, a Lacedæ­

himself master of those vessels which were hauled a-

defence; and, having first engaged and put to flight

the Chians, the rest of the forces under Pædaritus are

after this, the Chians were blocked up by sea and land

more closely than ever, and a terrible famine raged a-

mongst them.

The Athenian deputation, headed by Pisander, ha­

terms of accommodation. Alcibiades now, as the

conduct of Tissaphernes was still dubious and wavering,
