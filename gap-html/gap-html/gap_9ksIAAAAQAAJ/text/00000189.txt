B.VI. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 177

I cheerfully persevered in these my favourable incli-

"nations towards you, till you yourselves, bent on

m accommodating your differences with the Athenians,

"employed my adversaries to negotiate your affairs;

"and, as thereby you invested them with authority,

"you of course reflected disgrace on me. With rea-

"son therefore, after such provocations, you were af-

"terwards thwarted by me, when I supported the in-

*-* of brooking. But incendiaries started up; such as,  
'* not only in earlier times, but even in our own, have

"driven the people to more furious measures, and have

"'"-at length effectedâ€” the exile of Alcibiades. But.

*' so long as the State was in my own management, I  
** thought myself justified, could I preserve it in that  
** height of grandeur and freedom, and on the lame
