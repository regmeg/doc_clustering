76 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.V.

self. The whole army was commanded by Agis, the

fon of Archidamus, king of the Lacedæmonians. The

new turns th£y expected for their service took not effect

within the city, but they made themselves masters of the

new-erected walls, and levelled them with the ground.

They also took Hysiæ, a town in Argia; and, having

put all the freemen found within that place to the sword,

they drew off, and dispersed to their several cities.

After this, the Argives marched their force into Phli-

asia; and, after ravaging that district, because the ex-

ilcs from Argos had met with a reception there, they

again retired: For many of those exiles had taken up

their residence at Phlius.

In the fame winter, the Athenians, exasperated against

Perdiccas, prevented all manner of importations into

Macedonia. They charged him " with taking part in

"the late treaty, confirmed by the sanction of oaths,

"between the Argives and Lacedæmonians; that, far.

"ther, when they had made great preparations against

"the Chalcideans of Thrace and Amphipolis, and Ni-

"cias, the son ofNiceratus, was appointed to command

"in that service, he had violated his obligations to act

** in concert, and that expedition came to nothing pure-  
"ly through his secession: He was therefore an enemy

"to Athens." ...

The winter expired in this manner; and with it the

fifteenth year of the war came also to an end.

YEAR XVI.J

WHEN summer came on, Alcibiades, with twenty

fail, arrived at Argos, where he leized three hundred

of the citizens, whose fidelity to the Athenians, and ad­

herence to the Lacedæmonian interest, was still suspect­

ed; and these the Athenians secured in the neighbouring

islands, which were subject to their dominion.
