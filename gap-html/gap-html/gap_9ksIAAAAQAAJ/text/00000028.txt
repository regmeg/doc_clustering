i6 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.V.

demands, with large justifications, were urged on both

sides, till, at length, it was agreed, that " a peace

"should be concluded, each party restoring what they

** had conquered in the war, but Nisæa to remain in  
"the hands of the Athenians." Platæa was re-demand­

ed by the latter, but the Thebans urged that it had noc

fallen into their hands by force or by treachery, but

they possessed it in pursuance of a free and voluntary

surrender. And, upon the same plea, the Athenians

kept Nisæa.

Things being so far adjusted, the Lacedæmonians

called together their consederates; and all their voices,

excepting those of the Bœotians, and Corinthians, and

Eleans, and Megareans, who were not at all satisfied

with these proceedings, concurring for a peace, they ra­

tify the accommodation, and solemnly pledged the ob­

servance of it to the Athenians, who, in exchange,

swore the same to the Lacedæmonians, in effect as fol-

loweth:

"THE Athenians and Lacedæmonians, and their

"allies, have made peace on these terms, and every

"State hath sworn to their observance.

"In regard to the common temples: — Permission is

"granted, to all who desire it, to sacrifice, to visit, to

"consult the oracles, to send public deputations, in

"the prescribed forms of every people, both by land

"and sea, without any molestation.,

"That the sacred soil and the temple of Apollo at

"Delphi, and Delphi itself, be ruled after its own mo-

** del, be taxed at its own discretion, and be adminis-  
"tered by its own magistrates, whose determinations to

"be final both in regard to life and property, accord-

** ing to the primitive laws of the place.

"That this peace continue for the space of fifty

"years, between the Athenians and the confederates

"of the Athenians, on the one side, and the Lacedæ-

** monians and the consederates of the Lacedæmonians,
