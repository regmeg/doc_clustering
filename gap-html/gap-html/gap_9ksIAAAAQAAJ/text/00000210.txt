ans to raise those pans of their wall to a greater height,

and to take the guard of it upon themselvts, as amongst

the body of their confederates they had divided the

guard of the rest of their works, allotting a proper

charge to each.

Nicias also judged it expedient to fortify the spot cal­

led Plemmyrium. Plemmyrium is a point of land

over-against Syracuse, which, jutting out before the

great harbour, renders the mouth of it very narrow.

"If this were fortified," he thought " the importa-

"Syracusan shipping lay; and, should it be their ill—

"supplies than in the present station of their fleet at

M the bottom of the great harbour." Now also he be­

gan, with greater attention than before, to study how

to distress them by sea; convinced, since the arrival of

Gylippus, how little room he had to hope for success

by land. To this spot therefore he ordered his fleet,

and drew his land-forces down, and immediately erected

three forts. In these the greatest part of the baggage

was laid up; and the transports and tight ships were

immediately stationed there. To this project, however,

the havock that afterwards ensued amongst the seamen

is principally to be ascribed: for, as they suffered in

this station under scarcity of water, and the mariners

were frequently obliged to fetch both water and wood

from a distance, since near at hand they were not to be

had, the Syraculan horse, who were masters of the

country, slaughtered them in abundance. The Syra-

cusans had posted a third part of their cavalry at their

fcrtreis of Olyrrpiæum, to bridle the marauding ex­

cursions of the enemy at Plemmyrium.

Now also Nicias received intelligence that the other

Corinthian ships were in their passage. To watch their

approach, he therefore detached twenty sail, who were
