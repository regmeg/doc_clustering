"equal nay superior in number to our own. That

"they will attempt it we have most certain ground to

** believe, but the seasons of doing it are intirely in  
** their own option; which also enables them to preserve  
** their vessels ever fit for service, as they are not neces-  
** sitated to be continually in action to strike awe into  
"others: Nay, we should hardly be able to do the

** like, though the number of our stripping were much  
** larger than it is, or though we were exempted from  
** the necessity we now lie under of keeping guard with  
*' them all. For, in case we make the least abatement  
** of our vigilance, We should be distressed for want  
"of necessaries, which even now we setch in with diffi-

"board our fleet, depait with impunity to their own

** by the greatntss of our pay, and imagined they were  
** rather come to plunder than to fight, when, contrary  
"to their hopes, they behold the ei;emy possessed of a

** numerous fleet, and making a brave resistance in e-  
** very quarter, some catch at the least pretext to goo-

** tended us hither from Athens, and since prevailed  
** with the captains of triremes to accept of the service  
"of Hyccarian slaves in redemption of their own, have

"by this means iubverted our naval discipline.

** I am writing to men well-mlightened in naval as-  
"sairs, and perfectly convinced, trtat the flower of an e-
