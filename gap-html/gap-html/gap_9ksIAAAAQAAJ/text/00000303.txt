ly the© they had determined to dispatch away the com­

mander Chalcideus, accompanied by Alcibiades, with

the five ships of their own equipment; but, at the in­

stant they were ready to move off", the news arrived,—

that " the squadron had been drove into Piræus." De­

jected by this unexpected event, because they had stum­

bled in the very first entrance on an Ionian war, they no

longer persisted in the design of sending away their owa
