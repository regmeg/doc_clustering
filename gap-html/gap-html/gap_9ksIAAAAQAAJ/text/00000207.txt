B.VII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 195

Selinuntians also, by a messenger dispatched on pur­

pose, they had summoned to meet them, with all their

united strength, at a determined place upon their route.

The Geloans also, and some of the Siculi, promised to

attend with a party, though by no means considerable.

The latter of these were disposed better than ever to the

service, since Archonides was lately dead, (who, reign­
