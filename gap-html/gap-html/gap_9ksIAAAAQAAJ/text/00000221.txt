B.VII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 209

which Thucydides hath compiled the history, came

also to an. end.

YEAR XIX.J

THE following spring no sooner approached, than,

at an earlier date than on any former occasion, the La­

cedæmonians and allies invaded Attica; and Agis, the

son of Archidamus, king of the Lacedæmonians, had

the command of the army. At first they ravaged the

country, particularly the plains; and this being done,

having allotted out the work in portions to the several

States, they set out about fortifying Decelea. Now,

Decelea is distant at most but *one hundred and twenty

stadia from the city of Athens, and lies at the fame dis­

tance, or very little more, from Bœotia: but in the

plain, and on the finest spot of ground, from whence

effectually to annoy them, was their fortress raised; and

might be seen from the very walls of Athens.

In this manner the Peloponnesians and allies erected

a fortress within Attica itself; whilst, in the same por­

tion of time, their friends in Peloponnesus embarked

a body of heavy-armed on-board their transports, and

sent them off for Sicily. For this service the Lacedæ­

monians picked out from the very best of the Helots

and of those citizens of Sparta who were newly enfran­

chised, from both together, six hundred heavy-armed;

and appointed Heccritus, a Spartan, to command them.

And the Bœotians sent three hundred heavy-armed,

commanded by Xeno and Nicon of Thebes, and He-

gesander of Thespiæ. These were first embarked at

Xænarus in Laconia, and thence put out to sea.

Soon after these, the Corinthians sent away five hun­

dred heavy-armed; some from Corinth itlelf, others

hired from the Arcadians; and appointed Alexarchus,
