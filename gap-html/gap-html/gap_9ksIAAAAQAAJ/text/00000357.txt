B.VIII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 345

mocracy at Athens, and those at Athens to force an olu

garcbical form upon the army. The soldiers, farther,

immediately summoned a general assembly, in which

they deposed their former commanders, and all such

captains of triremes as fell under their suspicions, and

then chose others to fill up the vacancies, both captains

of triremes and land-commanders, amongst whom were

Thrasybulus and Thrasyllus. The last rose up in the

assembly, and encouraged them by every topic of per­

suasion; particularly, —— that " they had not the least

"reason to be dispirited, though Athens itscif had re-

"volted from them; for this was merely the secession

** of a minority from men whose numbers were greater,

"Samos that the others had hitherto been masters of the

*' bar them the use of the sea than be barred up by  
*' them. What assistances Athens had hitherto given  
*' them against the enemy were but trifling, and of no  
** real importance. Nothing could be lost from that  
*' quarter; which was no longer able to supply them  
** with money, since with that they had been supplied  
** by the army; nor to send them any valuable instruc-
