|68 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B. VI.

"OUR journey hither was intended for the renewal

** of a former alliance; but, as this Syracusan hath ta-  
"ken the liberty to be severe upon us, we lie under an

"obligation to flhew the justice of our title to that share

** of dominion which we now possess. And the strong-  
"tst evidence of this he himself hath been pleased to

** give, by affirming, that lonians have been eternal

foes to Dorians. The fact is incontestibly true:

"Since we, who are lonians, have been necessitated to

"stand ever upon our guard against the incroaching

** designs of the Pcloponnesians, who are Dorians, who  
** are our superiors in number, and are seated upon our  
** borders. When, therefore, in the close of the Per-  
f* sian invasion, we saw ourselves masters of a navy, we

** asserted our own independence from the government  
*f and guidance of the Laced√¶monians, since no sha-  
** dow of reason could be found why we should be obe-  
** dient to them any more than they to us, save only  
." that in this critical period their strength was greater,

*^ We were afterwards appointed, by free election, the  
** leaders of those lonians who had sormerly been sub-  
"ject to the monarch. And the preference awarded to

us we continue to support; assured that on'y thus we

f shall escape subjection to the Peloponnesian yoke, by

** keeping possession of a power which can effectually  
"awe all their incroachments. And, farther, (that we

"may come to particulars,) it was not with injustice

** that we exacted subjection from those lonians, and in-  
"habitants of the isles, whom the Syracusans fay we

f* thought proper to inflave, though connected with us

** by the ties ot blood: For they marched, in company  
V with the Mcde, against their mother-country, against

** us, their founders. They had not the courage to ex-  
** pose their own homes to ruin and devastation by an  
y honest revolt, though we with magnanimity aban-

"doned even Athens itself. They made slavery their

K choice, and in the same miserable fate would have

** been.
