abroad, but also for the numerous force with which it

was provided to attack the foe; for the remoteness of

the ..voyage, great as ever they had undertaken from

their, native clime, and that prodigious expectation

which was raised of the event; in order to which the

State had now exerted itself quite beyond its strength.

When the whole force was got on-board the fleet,

when the stowage of all necessary stores and all baggage

whatever was completely adjusted, silence then was

proclaimed by sound of trumpet: But the solemn,

prayers for a successful expedition were not offered from

every vessel apart, but in behalf of all united, by the

voice of a herald. The goblets mingled with wine ran

the circle of the whole armament, and every crew as

well as the commanders poured out the libations, and

drank success and happiness out of gold and silver cups.

The whole crowd that stood upon the beach, both of

citizens and such strangers as were there and wished

them prosperity, joined with them in the public prayer.

friends, it

would draw after it the destruction of the Start: This his pre-sentiment soon
became

the public talk, Meton, the Astronomer, who was named to a post of high rank
in

the expedition, feigned himself mad and set his house on fire. Others deny
that cir­

cumstance of his counterfeiting madness j and fay, he set his house on fire by
night,

and appeared next morning on the forum in an abject manner, and begged of his
fel­

low-citizens, in order to comfort him under so great a misfortune, to excuse
hit son,

who was to have commanded a trireme, from going the voyage. An incident,

farther, at the very time of the departure of the grand fleet, gave many
persons vast;

concern. The women were then celebrating the rites of Adonis, in which many

representations of deaths and funerals were exhibited all over Athens 5 and
