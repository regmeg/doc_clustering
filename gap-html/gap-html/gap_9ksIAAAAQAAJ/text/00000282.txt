27o THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B. VI!.

On the ensuing day, by early dawn, they were again

in motion, and advanced about f twenty stadia; when,

descending into a certain plain, they halted and formed an

incampment. Thrir design in this was to fetch in some

provisions, for the adjacent country was inhabited, and

to get a proper supply of water to carry along with

them far in the country beyond, through which their

route was fixed, no springs were to be met with for the

Jength of several stadia. But, during this halt, the Sy-

racuiansv advancing beyond them, throw up a work a-

cross their route to stop their fartheir progress. The

spot chosen for this was a strong eminence, Banked on

both sides by an inaccessible crag, and known by the

name of Acræum-Lepas.

On the day following the Athenians resumed their

march but the horse and numerous darters of the Sy-

raculans and allies stopped their advance, the latter

pouring in their weapons upon, and the former riding

up and disordering, their ranks. For a long time, it is

true, the Athenians maintained the skirmishes against

them i but at length they retreated again to their last in­

campment. And now all farther supplies of provisions were

totally cut off-, it being no longer possible to fetch; i» a*

ny, for fear of the horle.

But, decamping early in the morning, they continued

their march, and forced their progress to the eminence

which was fortified by the new work. Here they found

the Syracusan infantry drawn up before them in firm and

deep battalia, posted also on the strong eminence they

had occupied on purpose; for the pals was very narrow.

The Athenians marched up and assaulted the work;

but, being pelted by showers of darts from the emi­

nence, which was very steep, and so gave those upon k

a great advantage in throwing their weapons home, and

finding themselves unable to force it, they again drew

off, and attempted it no farther. It happened, at the

f Two miles.
