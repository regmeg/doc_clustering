328 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VIIL

since he stood in great awe of the Peloponnesians, and

adhered to that rule of policy he had learned from him,

"to war both fides out," • • — Alcibiades now had re­

course to another piece of resinement, causing Tissa-

phernes to insist upon such exorbitant terms that no ac-
