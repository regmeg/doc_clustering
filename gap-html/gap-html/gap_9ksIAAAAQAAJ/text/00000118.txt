io6 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VI.

In this manner Nicias delivered his sentiments. But

the far greater part of the Athenians who were present

declared for the expedition, and against the repeal of

what had been already decreed. Some however there

were, who made a fruitless opposition.

The person who shewed molt ardour, and pressed them

most earnestly to proceed, was Alcibiades, the son of

Clinias; partly from a resolution to oppose Nicias, with

whom, in other political points, he generally clashed,

and diet, as also at that greatness of spirit which he

shewed in every single branch of his conduct, turned

therefore, Alcibiades stood up, and advised the Athe­
