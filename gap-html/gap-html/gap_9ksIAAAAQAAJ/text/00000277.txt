B. VII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 265

Bur, in this interval, the Syracusans and Gyljppus,

by sallying out with the land-forces, had gained a march

before them, had blocked up the roads along the coun­

try by which it was judged the Athenians would march,

and had posted strong guards upon all the fords of brooks

and rivers; nay, their detachments stood ready drawn

up in battalia to beat off the enemy from the most con­

venient passes. Standing out farther into the harbour

with their fleet, they dragged from the shore the Athe­

nian shipping. Some few of these they burnt, as the

Athenians themselves had designed to do; but the resi­

due at their leisure, from the (pot where each lay stran­

ded, they took in tow and carried away to the city.

And, this being done, when Nicias and Demosthenes

judged that they had completed such preparations for

their march as were absolutely needful, the dislodge-

nient of the whole army was put in execution on the

third day from the naval engagement.

Terrible indeed it was, not only when viewed in one

particular light, as that they retreated because they had

lost the whoie of their fleer, and all their mighty hopes

had terminated in such personal dangers to themselves,

and such as even boded the ruin of Athens; but the ve­

ry abandoning of the camp presented to their fight the

most cutting spectacles, and struck each foul amongst

them with heart-piercing anguish: For, as the dead lay

uninterred upon the surface of the earth, when the re­

mains of m old acquaintance, thus miserably laid out,

arrested the eyes of a soldier, he was instantly seized

with regret and horror. But the living, who on account

of wounds and sickness were left behind, were causes

of much greater affliction to the found than were even

the dead, and in truth were much more to be deplored

than those who had no longer a being: For, bursting

out into prayers and lamentations, they occasioned a

wild irresolution of thought; earnestly intreating that

they might not be left behind, and screaming out aloud

on each by name, as they saw a friend, or an acquaintance,
