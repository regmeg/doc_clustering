iS6 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VI.

** Argives, and Mantineans, and Athenians, and the  
** flower of the isles, we are here assembled together,—-  
"how is it possible, when such brave and numerous

** allies are to fight in company, that we should not  
* * entertain a stedfast, nay the warmest, hope, that the  
"victory will be our own? Nay more, as we have to

** do with a promiscuous crowd, the mob of a city,  
"not selected for service, as we have had the honour

*I to be; and who, it must be added, are but Sicilians;  
"who, though affecting to despise us, will never sus-

"tain our charge, because their skill is far beneath their

"courage.

"Let every soldier farther recal to his remembrance,

"that he is now at a vast distance from his native foil,

** and near no friendly land but what you shall render  
"such by the efforts of your valour. Such things I

"am bound to suggest to your remembrance, the re-

"verse, I am well convinced, of what our enemies utter

"for their mutual encouragement. They undoubtedly

"are roaring aloud — It is for your country you are

"now to fight. But 1 tell you, that from your coun-

"try you are now remote; and, as such, must either

"conquer, or not without disficulty ever see it again,

"since the numerous cavalry of the enemy will press

"hard upon our retreat. Call therefore to mind your

"own dignity and worth; advance with alacrity to

"assault your foes; convinced, that your present ne-

"cessities and wants are far more terrible than the

"enemy you are to engage."

When Nicias had finished this exhortation, he led on

his army towards the encounter. But the Syracusans

were not yet prepared, as by no means expecting to be

charged lo loon; and some of the soldiers, as the city

lay so near, were straggled thither. These however

came running with all eagerness and speed to gain their

posts; too late upon the whole; but, as each of them

met with any number intent on action,, he ranged

himself
