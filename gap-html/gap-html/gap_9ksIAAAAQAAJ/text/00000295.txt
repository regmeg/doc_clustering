B.VIII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 283

In the beginning of the ensuing winter, animated by

the terrible blow the Athenians had received in Sicily,

the whole body of Greece was alert against them. li­

ven such as had hitherto observed a strict neutrality,

without so much as waiting for a formal invitation to

accede, thought it incumbent upon themselves no longer

to be absent from the war, but voluntarily to enter the

lists against the Athenians. Not a State but reasoned

thus,—that " themselves also these Athenians, had they

"succeeded in Sicily, would undoubtedly have attack-

"ed and then concluded, — that, " as the war for

*' certainty was very nearly finished, it would be glo-  
*' rious for them to have a hand in its completion.'*  
But the old confederates of the Lacedæmonians, as

their desires were greater, so they exerted themselves now

with higher alacrity than ever to procure a speedy relax­

ation of their heavy burdens. Yet, in a most remarka­

ble manner, such States as were dependent upon Athens

manifested their readiness to revolt, even beyond the

bounds of caution; since now they formed their judge­

ments in all the warmth of indignation, and could dis­

cern no probable method by which the Athenians could

retard their ruin for another summer.

All these circumstances coinciding, the Lacedæmo7

nian state became prodigiously alert; and, above all,

with the expectation, that their confederates of Sicily,

with a powerful reinforcement, as their navies must now

of necessity act in concert, would be with them, in all

probability, very early in the spring. In every view

their hopes were gallant and elate. They determined

to go on with the war without any delay; concluding

that, if once brought well to a conclusion, they should

ever for the future be released from such dangers as had

lately threatened from Athens, in case Sicily had been

reduced; and, should they now demolish their competi­

tors, must remain for the future supreme leaders

of Greece, without fear of a reverse.
