B.VIII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 331

Athenian squadron out at sea in a course from Chalce;

yet, neither making any motion to bear down upon the

other, one fleet pursued their course to Samos, the o*

ther put into Miletus. They were now convinced, that,

without fighting at sea, they could not possibly relieve

Chios.

Here this winter ended: And the twentieth year

of this war expired, the history of which Thucydide«

hath compiled.

YEAR XXI. J

I N the ensuing summer, upon the first commence­

ment of the spring, Dercylidas, a Spartan, at the head

of an army not considerable for numbers, was senr. over­

land to Hellespont to effectuate the revolt of Abydus:

They are a colony of the Milesians. The Chians also,

whilst Astyochus was perplexed about thejmethod of re­

lieving them, were necessitated, by the intolerable

closeness of the blockade, to hazard an engagement ac

sea. It happened, whilst Astyochus was yet in Rhodes,

that Leon, a Spartan, who came over with Anrislenes,

though merely as a passenger, had arrived at Chios from

Miletus, to act as governor after the death of Pædaritus,

with twelve sail of (hipping draughted from the squa­

dron stationed at Miletus: Of thelc, five were Thurian,

four Syxacusan, one belonged to Anæa, another was

Milesian, and one was Leon's own. Upon this, the

Chiang having sallied out with all their force and carried

a strong post from the enemy, and at the same time

their fleet, consisting of six and thirty sail, launching

forth against the thirty-two Athenian, an engagement

followed; and, after a battle hotly maintained on both

sides, the Chians and allies, who had not the worst of the

dispute, sheered off again into harbour; for by this

time it began to grow dark.
