338 THE FELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VllI.

wards introduced the four hundred into the senate, in

the following manner.

The whole body of the citizehs were daily under

arms, either upon the Walls or in the field, to bridle the

excursions of the enemv from Decelea. Therefore^ on

the day appointed, they susfered such as were not ih the

secret to repair to their posts as usual: But, to those in

the plot, it had been privately notified, "by rtd

"means to repair to their posts, but to lag behind at *

** distance; and* in cafe any one should strive to oppose  
"what was now to be agitated, they should take up

"arms and quell all opposition." Those, to whotri

these orders were previously imparted, were the An*

drians and Teiians, three hundred of the Carysthians,

and other persons now established in Ægina, whom the

Athenians had sent thither by way of colony* but Were

how invited to repair to Athens with their arms to sup­

port the scheme. When these dispositions Were formed,

the four hundred (each carrying a concealed dagger, and

guarded by one hundred and twenty youths of Greece,

whose hands they had employed when assassination was

ihe point) broke in upon the * counsellors of the ieatl,

who were this moment sitting in the senate-house* and

called out to them " to quit the place and take: thik

** f salaries." Accordingly they had ready fo* them  
the full arrears due to them, which they paid to each as

he went out of the house. In this manner the Senate,

without giving the least opposition, removed themselves

tamely from their office and the rest of the citizens

trade no effort to check such proceedings, and re­

frained from any the least tumult.
