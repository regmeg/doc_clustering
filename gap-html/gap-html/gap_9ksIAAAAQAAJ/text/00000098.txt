*' tion, that, according to the best lights we have

"been able to collect, they repute as honourable the

"things which please them, and as just the things

"which promote their interest. Such maxims are noe

** in the least conducive to your preservation,: It is all  
« chimera.'!'.

Mel i ans;

« NO. We ground our hopes of relief from them

** upon their own clear conviction of whit their interest;

injoineth them. This.never can suffer them to enter*

*' tain a thought of abandoning the Melians, who are  
»* a colony of their own; of being faithleis to the States

*' of Greece, who wish them well; or of promoting the'

schemes of the common foe."

Athenians.

"OF consequence you imagine,-»«that their interest'

»* is connected with your security; that the duties of juf-

« tice should in honour be observed, though attended'

*' with dangers. But these are maxims which the La­  
s' cedæmonians, least of all men, have resolution enough

V to observe in fact."

Melians,

"WE have the strongest grounds to imagine* that

*' in our defence they will hazard any dangers, from a-  
*' sense that their own preservation dependeth more-on  
"us than any other people, as we are finely situated for'

*' doing them service in Peloponnesus, and in affection-  
** are more faithfully attached to them through the  
*» bands of consanguinity."
