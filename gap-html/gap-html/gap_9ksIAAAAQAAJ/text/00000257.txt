cle of power: And yet, finding themselves unable to

give any measure of luccess-to their projects by intro*

during dissentions amongst them through political em­

broilments, nor even by a powerful force, superior to

that of their foes, able to ward off the many blows they

had received, they had fallen beforehand into great anxi­

thought of which they never could hitherto have con­

From this time the Syracusans scoured the whole

harbour without having any thing to fear. They had

also formed a scheme of barring up its mouth; that the

Athenians, though never so intent upon it, might for

the future not have it in their power to steal away.

Their care and diligence were no longer employed on

the view alone of their own preservation, but on the

had given them the ascendant over these invaders; and,

could they but compass the total overthrow of this body

of Athenians and their allies, the grand atchievement

would strike all Greece with admiration. Nay more,

all other Grecians must reap the fruits of such success;

of whom some would in an instant recover freedom, and

others be delivered from the fear of losing it: For the

remaining strength of Athens would never be able to

stand against that weight of war with which she must be

soon incompassed about. And thus, could they (Syra-

they must infallibly become objects of wonder, not only

to all the present age, but to latest posterity. And of a

Athenians, but also of their whole extensive and combi­

ned alliance; and this, not merely to earn laurels for

themselves, but for the auxiliaries also who had engaged

in their cause; since, exposed in the front of the war
