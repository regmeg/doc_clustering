B.VIII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 313

But, about the fame juncture of time, the Chians

and Pædaritus, not bearing to acquiesce under the di­

latory answers of Astyochus, pressed him, by repeated

messages, " to come over with the whole of his force,

and relieve them from the present blockade; and by
