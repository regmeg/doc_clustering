them into the temple of Venus at Eryx, they shewed

them the offerings repofited there, the cups, the flagons,

and the censers, and the other furniture of the temple,

in quantity by no means small. These, being all of silver,

presented to the eye a vast show of wealth, far beyond

their intrinsic value. Having also made entertainments

in private houses, for those who came in the vessels of

the embassy, they amassed together all the gold and

** them, they should reconcile their differences with the  
"Selinuntians, either by force of arms or negotiation:
