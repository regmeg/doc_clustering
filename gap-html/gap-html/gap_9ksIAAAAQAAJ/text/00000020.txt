8 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.V.

"inform you in what manner I have planned the method

of attack, lest hazarding the event with so small a par-

** ty, and not with our intire force, may seem unequal  
"to the work, and may too much dispirit you. The

** enemy, I conjecture, from an utter contempt of us,  
** and a strong presumption that we durst not come out  
"into the field against them, have shewn themselves

"before this city; and this very moment, disorderly

"scattered as they are to view the situation, they hear-

"tily despise us. The leader, therefore, who hath the

** most acuteness in detecting such blunders in a foe,  
"and then scizeth the proper moment to fall upon

"them, as best enabled by his own strength; not so

"much in the open and regular manner of a methodi-

"cal fight, as with a surprise, most advantageous in the

** present juncture; —such a leader may, for the most  
"part, be assured of success. Such stealths as these

"draw after them the highest glory: By these, the

"man, who over-reacheth his enemy the most, per-

** formeth the most substantial service for his friends.  
"Whilst, therefore, haughtily presuming on their own

"worth, they remain thus disordered, and, by what

"appeareth to me, are bent more on drawing osf than

"remaining here,— during this their intermission of

** purpose, and before their resolutions can be regular-  
"ly adjusted, I myself, at the head of my chosen par-

"ty, will be amongst them, if possible, and will rush

** with vigour into the center of their army. And then,  
** Clearidas, when once you perceive that I am engaged,  
"and, as in probability it must be, have thrown them

"into disorder; then, at the head of yours, accompa-r

"nied by the Amphipolitans and the rest of the conse-

,f derates, throw open the gates on a sudden for your

** sally, and advance with your utmost speed to the  
"charge. And thus, it may considently be hoped, the

f< enemy must be thrown into the utmost consternation;

"because a second body, thus running to the charge,

w is more terrible to the foes than the; present which is-

already
