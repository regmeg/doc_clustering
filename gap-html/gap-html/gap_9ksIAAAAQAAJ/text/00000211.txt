B.VIL THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 199

appointed to cruize about Locri, and Rhegium, and

the capes of Sicily, in order to intercept them.

Gylippus in the mean time was employed in building

the counter-wall along EpipoJæ, making uie of the

stones which the Athenians had laid ready in heaps for

the continuation of their own work. It was also his

daily custom to draw up the Syracusans and allies in

order of battle, and lead them out beyond the point of

the counter-wall; which obliged the Athenians to draw

up likewise, to observe their motions. And, when

Gylippus judged he could attack them with advantage,

he instantly advanced; and, the charge being given

and received, a battle ensued in the space between their

respective works; but so narrow, that no use could be

made of the Syracusan and confederate horse. The Sy­

racusans and allies were accordingly defeated. They

fetched off their slain by truce i and the Athenians e-

rected a trophy. But Gylippus, having assembled ihe

army round him, thought proper to make this declara­

tion in the presence of them all: — That " the deseat

"was not to be charged on their want of bravery, but

*' on his own indiscretion: he had deprived them of  
*' the service of their own cavalry and darters, by  
"ranging his battle in too confined a spot between the

*' works: that he would now again lead them out in a  
** more judicious manner.* He exhorted them there­  
fore "to imprint it strong on their remembrance,

'* that, as in real strength they were not interior, it

"would be intolerably disgraceful, if they, who to a

"man were Peloponnesians and Dorians, should not

"manifest themselves so resolutely brave, as to con-

*' quer and drive out of their country a parcel of Ioni-  
*' ans and islanders, and a promiscuous rabble of hun-  
"gry adventurers." Having addressed them thus, he

lay on the watch to seize a proper opportunity; and, as

soon as he had gained it, led them on again to the

charge.
