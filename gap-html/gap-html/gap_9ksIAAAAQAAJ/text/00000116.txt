*' voc made amongst us by pestilence and war, and  
*' to repair the prodigious waste of our fortunes and  
"our lives. These, according to all the rules of equi-

"ty, should be reserved for our own domestic exigen-

"cies, and not be lavished away on a set of fugitives,

"who implore our protection, and are bound in inte-
