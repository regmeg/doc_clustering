B.VII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 215

whilst others in long boats were fastening cables round

the piles, and, by the help of a machine convenient for

the purpose, craning them up; and such as they broke

a set of divers sawed off close at the bottom. The Sy-

racusans in the mean time were pouring their missive

weapons upon them from the docks, which were plenti­

fully returned by those posted on the raft. In short,

the Athenians plucked up most of the piles; but one

part of the staccade was exceeding difficult to be demo­

often renewed, and every artifice of war was successively
