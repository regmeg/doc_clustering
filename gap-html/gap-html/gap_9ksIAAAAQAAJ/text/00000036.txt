2+ THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR: B.V.

ance. And at length, necessitated to dissolve the treaty

concluded at the ten years period, they engaged afresh

in open war.

The same Thucydides, an Athenian, hath also

compiled an account of these latter transactions in a re­

gular series, according to the summers and winters,

down to that period of time when the Lacedæmonians

and their allies put an end to the empire of Athens, and

became masters of the Icng-walls and the Piræus. The

whole continuance of the war to this period was twenty*

seven years. And, if any man be inclined to think that

this intervening accommodation mould not be reckoned

as war, he will find no arguments to support his opini­

on: For, let him only survey the transactions as they are

distinctly related, and he will find it an absurdity to pro?

nounce that an interval of peace, in which neither all

the restitutions were made, nor the benesits obtained,

which the mutual stipulations required. And, setting

these considerations aside, in the Mantinean and Epidau-

ric and other wars, transgressions were committed on

both sides. The confederates also of Thrace continued

still to be as great enemies as ever. And the Bœotians

never agreed to more than a bare cessation of arms, re*

newable every tenth day.

Including, therefore, the first war, which lasted ten

years, and that suspicious interval which ensued, and

ended at last in a second open rupture, the whole conti­

nuance, if computed by summers and winters, will turn

out, upon enquiry, to have been so many years, and

some few additional days. And such as laid stress up*

on the predictions of oracles can assent only to this com­

putation as genuine. For my own part, I perfectly

well remember that, not only at the commencement,

but even during the whole course, of the war, many

such predictions were gi ^:n out, that " it must needs

"continue three times nine years." I also lived through

. jts whole extent, jn the very flower of my understand­

ing and strength, and with a close application of my

thoughts
