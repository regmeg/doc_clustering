B.VII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 255

Gylippus, animated their men to engage with resoluÂ­

tion, by the following harangue.

"THAT your past achievements have been glorious

"indeed, and for the acquisition of greater honour

"and glory that you are now on the brink of engaging,

"the generality of you, ye Syracusans and confede-

"rates, are well convinced, and need not at present to

"be informed; for otherwise you could never have

"persisted so far in this warm career of bravery and fuc-

** cess: But, if there be a man amongst you whose sense  
** of things drops short of their real position, we shall  
** now throw upon it the needful illustration.

"This land, our property, the Athenians have inva-

** and, had this design succeeded, at inflicting an equal  
** fate on Peloponnesus and the rest of Greece. And  
** yet these very Athenians, who enjoy already the lar-

"of Greece hath at any time enjoyed, you are the first

** who have bravely resisted; and of that navy, on  
** which they erected their incroaching pile of power, are  
** plainly the victors in several engagements; as again,hi  
** that which now approacheth, you will assuredly beat  
** them. For men, who have received such severe  
** checks in a point for which they so highly plumed  
** themselves, wiH for the future have a much worse o-  
** pinion of their own merit than if they had never con-  
** ceived so high a value of it; and, when all their tow-  
** ering pretensions are so unexpectedly blasted, their

subsequent efforts must of course drop short of their

** real strength: And this, you may rest assured, is the  
** present state of yonder Athenians. And by parity, in  
** regard to ourselves^ that proportion of strength we  
** enjoyed at first, with which, though far inserior in  
** skill, we boldly and successfully presumed to with-  
** stand them, must now be suitably enlarged; and,  
f with the farther accession of this inward assurance,
