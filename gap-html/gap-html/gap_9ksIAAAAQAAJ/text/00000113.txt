B. VI. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 101

"the preeminence of honour awarded tome bias me to

"speak in contradiction to my judgement; nor shall it

** bias me at present; but what I think tends most to  
"the public good, that only (ball I utter.

"I am also sensible, that what I can urge may have

** but little influence on Athenian tempers, when I at-  
"tempt persuading you to secure what you already

"possess, and not to hazard the present for things invi-

"sible and future; but that your eagerness is quite un-

** we have found, that in the treaty itself many arti-

*t who have not accepted the accommodation; but, on  
** the contrary, are still in arms against us; whilst o-  
** thers are inhibited merely by ten-day truces, and that  
"only because the Lacedæmonian measures are hither-

** find our strength divided, the very measure into  
** which we are now precipitating ourselves, they may
