B.VIIT. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 289

Expeditious sailing was earnestly solicited; but the Co­

rinthians declared a reluctancy to go the voyage till

they had celebrated the Isthmian games, which were at

hand. To remove this obstacle, Agis declared him­

self ready to have the whole procedure charged to his

own account, that they might be cleared from a breach

of the Isthmian cessation. The Corinthians not com*

plying with this proposal, and delay necessarily result­

Cenchreæ, from passing undiscovered.

When the festival was over, the latter, with one and

twenty fail, under the command of Alcamenes, stood

out to sea in order for Chios. And the Athenians, ad­

vancing against them, at first with an equal number

os ships, stood off again into open sea j but, when the

Pcloponnesians would not follow them far, but stood

in to the land, the Athenians disappeared; for, having
