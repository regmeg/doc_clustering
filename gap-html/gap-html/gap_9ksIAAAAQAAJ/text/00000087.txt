B.V. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 75

cedaemon. A battle was fought within the precincts

of Argos, in which the people was the victor: Some

of their opponents they flew, and others they doomed

to perpetual exile. The Lacedæmonians, when their

adherents implored their succour, were too dilatory in

moving; but at last they adjourned the games, and

marched away to their support; and hearing, when

they were come to Tegea, that "the few were vanquish-

ed," they determined to proceed no farther, maugre

all the intreaties of the new exiles; but, retreating forth­

with toSparta,they resumed the celebration of the games.

Yet, being afterwards attended by deputations from

those in Argos, as well as by such as had been lately

banished, in the presence of the whole confederacy, af­

ter many arguments had been urged on both sides, they

came to a resolution, that *' the Argives in the city

** were guilty of injustice;" and a decree was pasted,  
that "they should march against Argos." But, after

all, their proceedings were dilatory and remiss.

In the mean time, the people of Argos, dreading the

Lacedæmonian strength, and re-addresling themselves

3gain to Athens for a renewal of alliance, and proceed­

ing to execute a plan which they thought the strongest

expedient of preservation, built long walls quite down

to the sea, that, in case they should be blocked up by

Jand, all proper supplies might be thrown into the city

by sea, through the good offices of the Athenians. To

this scheme of new fortifications some cities also of Pe­

loponnesus were privy underhand. The whole body

of the Argives without distinction, the citizens, their

wives, and their servants, forwarded the work; and

from Athens they were supplied with carpenters and

masons. And here the summer ended.

Winter now succeeding, the Lacedæmonians, when

advertised of these new fortifications, marched their for­

ces against Argos, their own, and all those of their al.

lies, excepting the Corinthian. Some new projects in

fheir favour were now also in agitation within Argos it­

self.
