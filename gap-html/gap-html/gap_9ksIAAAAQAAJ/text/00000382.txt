370 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VIII.

at Harmatus, which lies facing Methymne, and having

cat their dinner there, they passed with the utmost speed

by Lectus, and Larissa, and Amaxitus, and other ad­

jacent places, and reach Rhætium of the Hellespont

before midnight. Not but that some ships of the fleet

got up no farther than to Sigæum and some other adja­

cent places on that coast.

The Athenians, who were lying with eighteen fail at

Sestus, when the lights were waved by their own friends

for signals, and they beheld numerous fires kindled on

a sudden on the hostile coast, were well assured that the

Peloponsesians are approaching. The fame night,

therefore, under favour of the dark, and with the ut­

most expedition, they crept along under the Chersone-

sus, and reached Eleus, desirous to put out to sea and

avoid the enemy; and, for the sixteen ships at Abydus,

they stole away unperceived of the Abydians, though

notice had been sent them from their friends just arrived,

to keep a good look-out, and not suffer them to steal

off. Yet morning no sooner appeared, than, finding

themselves in sight of the fleet under Mindarus, and

that they were actually chaced, they could not all get

off. The greater part, indeed, fled safe to the conti­

nent and Lemnos; but four, that got last under fail,

are overtaken by the enemy near Eleus; one, also,

that ran ashore at the temple of Protesilaus, they seize

with all her hands ; and two more, the crews of which

escaped. One, sarther, but abandoned, they burn «t

Imbrus.

This done, the ships from Abydus having joined

them, and the whole fleet being now increased to four­

score and six sail, they spent the rest of the day in inves­

ting Eleus; but, as it would not surrender, they drew

osf to Abydus.

The Athenians, who had been deceived by their

scouts, and never imagined that so large a number of

hostile ships could pass along undelcried, were very

coolly carrying on their siege; but yet were no sooner

informed
