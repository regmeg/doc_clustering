a Corinthian, to command them. The Sicyonians also

sent two hundred heavy-armed along with the Corin­

thians, and at their head Sargeus, a Sicyonian.

But the five and twenty sail of Corinthians, which

launched out to sea in the depth of winter, lay ranged

in an opposite station to the twenty Attic at Naupactus,

to give leisure for the embarkation of the heavy-armed

on-board the transports from Peloponnesus. On this

which was yet behind, had completely joined him, and

Charicles had taken on-board the Argive auxiliaries.

About the fame time in this spring Gylippus also re­
