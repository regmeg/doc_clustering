B.VII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 253

"not less than to the seamen; fince this method of

"engagement is more particularly your province, and

"since it still remains within your power to earn a

"glorio.us victory, by putting your land-method into

"practice. But the seamen I exhort, and with my

"exhortations mingk my intreaties, not to shrink too

"much under the sensibility of pall defeats, as your

"decks are now better armed in all respects than they

"were before, and as the number of the shipping is

"enlarged. Recal the idea of that heart-delighting

"privilege, of which you are now to secure the con-

v ** tinuance:-— To you I speak, who, though not of

** Athenian extraction, have hitherto been regarded  
"and honoured as Athenians; and, for speaking well

"our language, and appropriating our manners, have

"been admired through the whole extent of Greece,

"have participated the benefits of our large-extended

"empire, not less than ourselves in point of profit,

"and much more than ourselves in striking awe into

"your vassals, and being exempted from the attacks

"of injustice. Since, therefore, you alone have freely

"shared our empire with us, you are bound by all the

"ties of honour by no means to desert its present vin-

"dication. Then, in open despight of those Corin-

"thians whom you have so often conquered, and of

"those Sicilians not one of whom durst look us in the

** face so long as the vigou/ of our fleet was unim-  
.** paired, drive your foes before you, and strike into

** them the plain conviction — that your military skill,  
** though struggling with weakness and misfortunes, is  
"yet far superior to all their strength and luck united.

"But to the native citizens of Athens amongst you

** 1 must once more suggest, that you have now no  
"longer in your docks such another fleet as this, nor

** have left behind you such another body of heavy-  
"armed. If, therefore, your immediate fate be any

** thing less than victory, your enemies will fail and be  
** directly at Athens; and' the remainder os our forces

"there
