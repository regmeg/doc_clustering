B.V. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. n

though Cleon, who from the sirst had never intended to

. stand an engagement, flies instantly awayand, being

intercepted by a Myrcinian targeteer, is slain. But his

heavy-armed, embodying together and gaining an emi­

nence, repulsed Clearidas, who twice or thrice attacked

them, and maintained their ground till the Myrcinian

and Chalcidic cavalry and the targeteers, 'surrounding

and pouring in their darts upon them, compelled them

to fly. Thus the whole Athenian army was distressed in

a laborious flight: They ran different ways amongst the

mountains; numbers had been destroyed in the charge,

others by the Chalcidic horse and targeteers; but the

remainder escaped in safety to Ei'on.

Those who took up Brasidas, when he dropped in

of Agnon, and defacing every memorial which might

continue the memory of his foundation. They acted

thus, partly out of real gratitude to Brafidas, whom they

regarded as their deliverer, and partly at this juncture

the death of Brafidas, made a visit to his mother Argileonis. The first
queston she

largely in his praise, and said, at last. There was not such another Spartan
left alive,
