B.Vil. THE PELOFONNESUN: WAfL m

of the Sicilians and Italians as had joined with them in

the invasion, were fold out for slaves. §

What the whole number of prisoners w^s* it is hard

exactly to relate j but» however, they could not be

fewer than seven thousand. And this proved to be the

greatest Grecian exploit of all that happened in the

course of this war; and, in my opinion, of all that oc*

cur in the whole history of Greece; since the event to

the victors was most glorious, and to the vanquished

most calamitous: For in every respect they were totally

overpowered, and their miseries in no respect had any

mitigation i In short, root and branch, as is commonly

said, their land-armies and their shipping Were now ru­

ined 5 nay, nothing belonging to them was exempted

from destruction; and few, out of all their numbers*

had the good fortune to revisit their native country*

Such were the transactions in Sicily. []

§ " The decent and engaging behaviour of the Athenians was of great service to

"them ; for by it they either soon obtained their liberty, or were highly
esteemed

"and caressed by their masters. Some of them were indebted for their freedom
to

"Euripides. The Sicilians, it seems, were fonder of the muse of Euripides
tharf

"were even the people who lived in Greece itself. If the strangers, who were
often

"resorting to Sicily, brought them any specimens or morsels of his poetry,
they

*• learned them by heart, and with high delight communicated them to their friends.  
"It is said, that several, who by this means earned their liberty, went
afterwards

"to wait upon Euripides) in token of their gratitude; assuring him, some of
ihtm,

"that they had been released from slavery for teaching their masters what
pieces of

"his writing they were able to repeat j and others, that, when vagabonds after
the

*« defeat, they had been supplied with meat and drink sot singing some of his lines.  
"This is not to be wondeted at; since even a Caunian vessel, which, brihg hard

"chased by pirates, and endeavouring to get for refuge into a Sicilian
harbour, was

"however kept off by force; till at length, being asked whether they could
repeat

*• any of Euripides's Verses, they answered in the affirmative; upon which they obJ  
"tained immediate reception and refuge." Plutarch in the Life of Nicias.
