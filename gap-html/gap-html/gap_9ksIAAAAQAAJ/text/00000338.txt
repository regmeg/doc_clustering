3i6 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VIII.

proceeded to make them this plain declaration —" And

"yet this turn in your favour can never take place,

** unless we temper our form of government with  
*' greater moderation, and intrust the administration in  
*' the hands of the few, that the king may have room

a charge of maladministration against Phrynichus, they

discharged him and his collegue Skirondas from their

commands, and sent away Diomedon and Leon to take

by no means a proper person to be let into-a share of

their intrigues with Alcibiades.

And thus Pisander — after visiting in order all the

several juntos of the accomplices, already formed in the

city with the view to thrust themselves into the feats of
