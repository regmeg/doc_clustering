12+ THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VL

** our own Syracuse, which, if once reduced, they are  
"well assured that nothing will be able afterwards to

** give a check to their arms. Taking it therefore for  
** grarfted that they will be immediately upon us, delibe-  
** rate in what manner you may make the most gallant  
defence in the present posture of your strength; care-

ful that through contempt you be not taken unprovi-

** ded, nor through incredulity abandon the means of  
** preservation. Nor, farther, let those, who are con-  
** vinced of their immediate appearance, be terrified at  
** the boldness or strength of their undertaking. For  
"they will not be able to hurt us more than we shaH

"more beyond our reach, because they invade us with

** so vast an armament; since this, in regard to the  
'* other Sicilians, will plead more abundantly in our

enabled to defeat their arms, or merely to force their

** return, their schemes unexecuted and their ambition  
"disappointed, (for I am not in the least afraid that

"their sanguine expectations can be glutted with suc-

** cess,) such events would reflect the highest glory upon  
"you, and complete what I firmly hope.

** It is a truth evinced by facts, that few considerable  
"armaments of either Grecians or Barbarians, which

** have been sent out on remote expeditions, have rc-

"strength mere hostile dread will cement and bind fast

"together. If therefore, though merely for wantof need-

"ful supplies, they incur miscarriages on a foreign shore i

** if they prove unsuccessful, though chiefly through  
their own misconduct; the whole honour must how-

* * ever rest with us, as if we had ruined their projects  
by art and management. Even these very Athenians
