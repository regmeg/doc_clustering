B. VL THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 117

** and procured also from Crete, not forgetting slingers;  
** and, in fine, that whatever should be judged in any

degree expedient should be provided in good time,

"and carried along with them in the fleet."

This the Athenians had no sooner heard, than they

instantly voted, '».." That the generals were invested

** with absolute authority, to determine the numbers  
"of the expedition, and the whole procedure of the

"voyage, at their own discretion, as might best pro-

"mote the public welfare."

In pursuance of this, the preparations were immedi­

ately in hand. Summonses for the quotas adjusted

were sent to their dependents, and the levies at home

went briskly forwards. Athens was now finely recover­

ed from the pestilence and a long-continued destructive

war; both in a multitude of young men now arrived at

the vigour of their age, and an increase of the public

revenues by favour of the peace. By this means all the

needful supplies were more easily provided; and thus

were the Athenians busied for the present in fitting out

their armament.

of Mercury, wherever found within the precincts of A-

thens, and according to the established custom they

were very numerous, both in the porches of private

houses and the public temples, f * * * * * had their

faces disfigured in the space of one night. The authors

of this outrage were not known but large rewards

were osfered by the State in order to discover them, and

a decree was also passed, that, "if any person knew of the

Mercuries of square stone: How such a description can be applicable to a
statue will

be hard to conceive. Whether they allude to the inclosure in which the statues
were

erected, or to the form of the pedestals, or whether a Mercury was carved on
any or

all the sides of a souare stone, I am not able to decide. The Mercuries were
very

numerous j and many of them, it is certain, were strange, uncouth, and very
bung­

ling performances.
