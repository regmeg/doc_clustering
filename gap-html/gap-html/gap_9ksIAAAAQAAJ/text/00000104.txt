larger force than had been sent thither heretofore, under

Laches and Eurymedon, and to attempt its total reduc­

the Grecians and Barbarians by whom it was inhabited;

ignorant, farther, that they were going to embark in a

war, not much less considerable than the Peloponnesian,

The compass of Sicily is little under eight days sail for

a trading vessel; and, though it be so large, it is severed

manner in which it was inhabited in the earliest ages

was this; and the several nations which possessed it

these.

The Cyclops and Lestrigons are said to be the most

ancient inhabitants of some part of this country; but,

from what stock they were derived, or from whence

they came hither, or what is become of them since, I
