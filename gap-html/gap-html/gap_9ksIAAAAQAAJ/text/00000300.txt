a88 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VIII.

from the other sea into that which lies towards Athens,

that all in a body,might stand away for Chios; as well

those which Agis had destined for the service of Lesbos

as the rest. The whole number of shipping belonging

to the'alliance, now assembled together there, amount­

ed to thirty-nine.

But Calligitus, truly, and Timagoras refused, in the

name of Pharnabazus, to have any participation in the

expedition to Chios; nor would part with the money

they had brought with them, which was * five and

twenty talents, to disburse this equipment. They in­

tended to get another fitted out, which should sail away

under their own orders.

As for Agis, when now he perceived that the Lace­

dæmonians were determined to go first to Chios, he no

longer suffered his own projects to clash with those of the

State; but the confederates now assembling at Corinth

proceeded to draw up a plan of operations. It was ac­

cordingly agreed, that they should go first to Chios,

under the command of Chalcideus, who fitted out the

five ships in Laconia; from thence to Lesbos, under

the command of Alcamenes, whom Agis had destined

for that service; in the last place they should proceed

to Hellespont, and in this service it was agreed before*

hand, that Clearchus, the son of Ramphias, should

take upon him the command. But the first step should

be the transportation of a moiety of their shipping across

the isthmus, which were immediately to stand out to

sea, that the attention of the Athenians might be less

engaged upon such as were already in their course than

on those which were to follow; for now they determi­

ned to cross the sea in an open insulting manner, as

they contemned the present impotence of the Athenians,

because they had no considerable force any where at sea.

When these resolutions were formally completed,

they immediately transported one and twenty ships.
