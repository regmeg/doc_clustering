B.VIII. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 319

*' two to share the dominion with him; because they  
"were less desirous of power on the continent, and by

** their peculiar turn of politics and military conduct  
"were better adapted for this purpose. They would

"be glad, at the same time, to subdue the maritime

Such was the advice which Alcibiades gave to Tissa­

phernes and the king when he had opportunities, and

which he really thought to be the best in policy : But

at the same time he had deep in his heart and in his

study bis own return to his country ; assured, within
