B.VI. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 183

drew up a derree, to send away supplies to chat arma­

ment, and a body of horsemen.

And here the winter ended; and the seventeenth year

of this war, of which Thucydides hath compiled the

history, came also to an end.

YEAR XVIII. J

O N the earliest approach of the spring which led on

the following summer, the Athenians in Sicily, hoist­

ing from Catana, shewed themselves on the coast of Me-

gara in Sicily, of Which the Syracusans, having dispos­

sessed the inhabitants in the time of Gelon, the tyrant,

(as I have already related,) continued mailers of the

foil. Having landed here, they ravaged the country;

till, approaching a fortress belonging to the Syracusans,

and attempting it without success, they retired, some

by land and the rest on-board the fleet, into the river

Tereas; from whence going again on-shore, they rava­

ged the plains and. set fire to the growing corn. Thry

also fell in with a small party of Syracusans, some

of whom they flew; and then, erecting a trophy, went

again on-board. They next returned to Catana; and,

aster victualling there, proceeded from thence, with

their whole force, to the attack of Centoripa, a strong

fort belonging to the Siculj j and, having made them­

selves masters of it by a capitulation, they stood away,

burning down in their passage the corn of the Inesseans

and Hybleans. Upon returning to Catana, they find

there two hundred and fifty horiemen arrived from A-

thens, though without horses, yet with all the proper

furniture, as if they could be better supplied with the

former in Sicily; as also thirty archers, mounted, and

•three hundred talents in silver.
