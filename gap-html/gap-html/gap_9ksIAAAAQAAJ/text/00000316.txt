304 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR; B. VHf,

not only for this, but all the subsequent instances of his

conduct, as a man of an excellent understanding.

In pursuance of this, the Athenians, so soon as thd

evening was closed, made the best of their way to Mile­

tus, and left the victory imperfect. And the Argives,

without making the least stay, chagrined as they were

at their late defeat, departed immediately from Samoa

to return to Argos.

The Peloponnesians, early the next dawn, weighing

from Teichiusla* stand into Miletus. After one day's

stay in that harbour, on the next, having augmented

their squadron with the Chian ships which had formerly

been chaced in company with Chalcideus, they determi­

ned to go back again to Teichiussa to fetch off what

stores they had landed there. Accordingly, when the/

were thus returned, Tiflaphernes, being come up with

his land-army, persuades them to stand directly against

Iasus» in which his enemy Amorges at that instant lay.

Thus, falling on Iafus by surprise, the inhabitants

of which expected none but an Athenian squadron,

they become masters of it. In this action the Syracu-

sans were the persons who gained the greatest honour,

Amorges, farther, the bastard-son of Pifluthnes, who

was a revolter from the king, was taken prisoner by the

Peloponnesians. They delivered him up to Tiflapher­

nes, that if he pleased he might send him to the king,

in obedience to his orders. Iafus* farther, they put to

the sack; and the army made on this occasion a very

large booty, for this city had ever been remarkable for

its wealth. They gave quarter to the auxiliaries in the

service of Amorges; and, without committing the least

insult upon them, took them into their own troops, as

the bulk of them were Peloponnesians. They deliver­

ed up the town into the hands of Tisiaphernes, as like­

wise all the prisoners, whether Oaves or freemen, upon

covenant to receive from him a * Daric stater for each.
