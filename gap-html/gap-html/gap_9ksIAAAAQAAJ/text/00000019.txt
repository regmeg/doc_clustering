B.V. THE PELOPGNNESIAN WAR. 7

upon the works, or issued out at the gates; for they

were all shut fast. He now concluded himself guilty of

a mistake, in coming so near the place without the ma­

chines, *' as the town must infallibly have been taken,

"because abandoned."

Brasidas, however, had no sooner perceived that the

Athenians were in motion, than, descending from Cer-

dylium, he marcheth into Amphipolis. He there wa­

balanced, but in real worth: for the Athenian force,

appointed for this service, was composed of the very

flower of Athens, and the choicest troops of the Lem-

their real state would have inspired. Picking out,

therefore, a party of one hundred and fifty heavy-armed

rest, he deligned to fall suddenly upon the Athenians in

their retreat; concluding, he should never again find

them in this forlorn manner, when the reinforcements

they expected were come up. Calling, therefore, all

his soldiers around him, as he was desirous ot animating

them, and letting them into his scheme, he harangued
