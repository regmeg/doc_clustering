with the Athenians for the restitution of Solium, or A-

nactorium, or any other point in which they thought

themselves aggrieved; but speciously pretending, that

*' they could never abandon their allies in Thrace,  
*' whom by solemn oaths they were bound to support;  
*' oaths which they had severally sworn when they first

for a misunderstanding had arisen between them and the

Lacedæmonians about Lepreum. In a former war

of the Lepreatæ against a province of Arcadia, the Ele­

ans had been prevailed upon tojoin the Lepreatæ for a moi­

ety of the land that should be conquered; and, at the

conclusion of the war, the Eleans left all the land in the
