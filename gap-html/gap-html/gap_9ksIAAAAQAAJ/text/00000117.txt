B.VI. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 105

*' but most frequently from calm and prudent delibera-  
"tion. In behalf, therefore, of your country, which

"is now on the brink of more critical dangers than e-

"ver it was known before, hold up your hands in op-

*' position, and support what I am going to move;  
"namely,—That " the Sicilians, confining themselves

*' within their present limits, which we do not pretend  
** to abridge, with free navigation along the coast  
"of the Ionian gulf, and transacting their own affairs

*' at large through the whole extent of the Sicilian seas,  
"be at liberty to take care of their own concerns with-

'* out any molestation ."—And, in particular, to return

"the Egesteans the following answer: "Since,

"without the privity of the Athenians, they have al-

'' ready involved themselves in a war against the Seli-

"nuntians, let them also, without the concurrence

"of the Athenians, bring it to a conclusion: That,

*' moreover, we shall form no alliance for the future,  
*' as hath formerly been the case, with men whose indi-  
*' rest behaviour we must be forced to abet, though,  
"when we stand in need of reciprocal assistance from

** them, we shail get none at all."

"And you, sir, who at present preside in this assem-

"bly, if you are conscious that it is your dury to su-

"perintend the public welfare, if you are desirous to

"behave like a worthy patriot, put the question, and

"call upon the Athenians once more to give their

"votes. And, in cafe you are afraid to act contrary

"to order, in proposing what is counter to a former

"decree; reflect that, when so great a crowd of wit-

"nesses are at hand to justify the ltep, you only act the

*' part of a physician to your country, which hath fwal-  
** lowed down pernicious counsels; and that he best  
"dilchargeth the duty of first magistrate, who will

"render to his country all the service he is able; at

"least, with his eyes open, will never suffer it to be

*' hurt."
