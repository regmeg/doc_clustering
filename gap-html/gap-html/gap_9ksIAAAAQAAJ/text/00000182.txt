i7o THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VI.

"own security in concert with that of our friends; so

*' far from the view of instaving them to ourselves, that  
*' we are solely intent on preserving them from being  
** inslaved by others. *

** Let no man here retort upon us,— that all our so.  
"licitude for you is unmerited and superfluous. Such

"an one must know, that, so long as you are safe, so

"long as you are able to employ the Syracusans, the

*' less liable they will be to send reinforcements from  
"hence to the Peloponnesians for our annoyance:

** And, as this is the real state of things, our concern  
"should most largely be bestowed upon you. By pari-

*' ty of rtalon it also highly concerns us to replant the  
*' Leontines; not in order to render them vassals to  
*' ourselves, as their relations of Eubœa are, but to  
"make them as strong and powerful as we are able;

*' that, seated as they then will be on her confines,  
*' they may compensate our remote situation in afford-  
*' ing a diversion to Syracuse. For, if the view be car-  
*' ricd back to Greece, we ourselves are there a match  
*' for our foes. The Chacidean there, whom after un-  
"justly inslaving we are taxed with absurdity for pre-

"tending to vindicate here, is highly serviceable to us;

"because he is disarmed, and because he furnisheth us

** with a tribute. But, here in Sicily, our interest de-  
*' mandeth, that the Leontines, and the whole body  
"of our friends, be restored to the fujl enjoyment of all

"their liberty and strength.

"Now, to a potentate invested with superior pow-

"er, or to a State possessed of empire, nothing that

"is profitable can be deemed absurd; nothing secure

"that cannot be safely managed. Incidents will arise

"with which we must temporize, and determine accor-

"dingly our enmity or our friendship. But the latter

"makes most for our interest here, where we ought by

*' no means to weaken our friends, but, through the  
"strength of our friends, to keep down and disable our

** enemies. Of this you ou^ht not to rest incredulous,
