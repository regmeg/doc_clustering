3+1 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VIIL

low, and banished by the ostracism, not from a dread

of his influence or weight, but for the profligacy of his

life and his being a public disgrace to his country. In

this they were countenanced by Charminus, one of the

commanders, and some of the Athenians afibciated with

them, to whom they gave this pledge of their sidelity.

Some other acts of the fame nature they committed by

instructions from them, and had it in agitation to multi­

ply their blows>, but those marked out for destruction,

getting wind of their design, communicate the whole to

Leon and Diomedon, who thought of an oligarchy with

high regret, because their credit was high with the peo­

ple; to *Thrasybulus also andThrasyllus, the.former*

captain of a trireme, and the latter of a band of heavy-

armed; and to such others as were judged most likely

to stem the fury of the conspirators. These they con-

"such exalted characters. It was dear honour to Hyperbolus; and gave him

"room to boast, that, though a scoundrel, he had been distinguistied like the
greats*

"and best Athenians; as Plato, the comic poet, fays of him,

"He always acted worthy of himself,

"But quite unworthy of luch high reproof:'

"The jhtll was ne'er design'd to honour scoundrels.

"In a word, no person was ever banished by the ostracism after Hyperbolus j it

"was he who closed the list."

* Thrasybulus, whose name now first occurs, acts a very high-spirited and noble  
yart in the close of this history. "If virtue could be weighed merely by
itself,

"without any regard to outward circumstance, I should not hesitate (fays Cor-

"nelius Nepos) to prefer him before all the great men in Greece. But I aver,

"that not one of them ever surpassed him in integrity, in resolution, in
grandeur

"of soul, and true patriotism. —Yet, 1 know not how it it, though nobody

"excelled him in real merit, many have outstripped him in point of fame. In

"the Peloponnesian war, (ibi tpart if it vibicb n<m rtmaim,) Thrasybulus did

many things without Aleibiades; Aleibiades did nothing without Thrasybulus;

"and yet the other, through a happiness peculiar to himself, reaped the glory
and

"benefit os all." So far this elegant Roman writer. The reader will soon see
some

of Thrasybulus his exploits, separately fronvsnd in concert with Akibiades:
But the

iglory of his lite was ridding Athens some year's after of thirty tyrants at a
blow; fer

which he was rewarded by a wreath of olive, the most honourable recompence his

grateful countrymen could bestow upon him. He-was ever a firm, intrepid,
disin­

terested, patriot j an d lost his life at last in the service of his country.
