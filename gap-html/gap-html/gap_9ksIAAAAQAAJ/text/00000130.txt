This accident in truth made a deep impression on their

minds. For it was construed as a bad omen in regard

to the expedition in hand, and as an evidence of fome

terrible combination to introduce innovations and an

overthrow of the democracy.

An information was at length given in by some fo-

journers and their footmen, relating indeed not at all to

the Mercuries, but to the defacements of other images

committed sormerly by some young men in a frolicsome

and drunken mood ; and how, farther, ** they had cele-

"braced * the Mysteries in private houses by way of

'* mockery," and amongst others they also accused

Alcibiades. The party most inveterate against him

caught readily at this charge. As he was the main ob­

stacle to the advancement of their own popularity and

credit, they concluded, that, in case they could rid them­

selves of him, they might at once become leaders of the

State. Hence they aggravated the charge, and bellowed

aloud, that "those mystic frolics, and the defacements of

*' the Mercuries, struck at the very foundations of the  
*( democracy ; and, that none of these outrageous acts  
** had been committed without his participation." They  
alledged, as a circumstance that corroborated the charge,

the whole tenor of his behaviour, flagrantly licentious,

and quite inconsistent with a democratical constitution.

Alcibiades endeavoured forthwith to clear himself the

best he could from all appearances of guilt, and declared

himself ready, before he entered upon the voyage, to

submit to a trial, (for the armament was now almost com­

pleted,) and, if proved to be guilty, to suffer the pe-
