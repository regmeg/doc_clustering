184 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VI.

In the fame spring, the Lacedæmonians also took the

field against Argos, and advanced as far as Cleonae;

but, the mock of an earthquake being felt there, they

again retired. And, after this, the Argives, making

an irruption into the Thyreatis, which borders upon

As Hermocrates and his colleagues had now formally

taken upon them the command, the whole force of Sy­
