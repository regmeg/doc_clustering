?8 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.V;

before they proceeded to hostilities, they sent a deputa­

tion from the army to demand a conference; whom the

Melians refused to introduce into the assembly of the

people, but, in the presence only of the magistrates and

the few, commanded them to deliver their instructions.

Upon this the Athenian deputation expressed them­

selves as followeth:

** SINCE to the people in full assembly we are pre-*  
w eluded from speaking, lest the many,— hearing their

"true interest declared at once by us in a continued

"discourse, and proved by arguments fitted to per-

"suade and tod strong to be refuted, ■ • might be

"the plain construction of this our guarded audience by

"the few: To you also, who now fit here, we recom-

*' mend a method of making that point yet more se-  
"cure, — that, to the reasons we offer, you reserve not

"your objections for one formal deliberate reply, but,

"in cafe we offer any seeming incongruity, you imme-

** diately interrupt us, and discuss the point. And tell  
"us, first, whether or not this proposal be agreeable."

The Melians, who composed the synod, answered

thus:

"THE candour of such leisurely debate, for mutual

"information, is not to be disapproved: And yet there

"seemeth to be great inconsistency between such can-

"dour and those warlike preparations, with which you

"no longer intend hereafter, but in present act have al-

** ready beset us. For we perceive, that hither you arc  
*' come to be authoritative judges of your own plea,  
"and that the decision must needs prove fatal to us:

*' Since if, superior in debate, we for that reason refuse

submission, our portion must be war t and, if we al-

:d upon the ifland. Yet,
