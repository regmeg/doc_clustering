264 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VII.

"day they were performing the anniversary sacrifice to

** Hercules,) in all probability would refuse to march;  
** because, transported as they were with success, the  
"generality no doubt were celebrating the sestival with

"good cheer and wine; and any thing might sooner be

** hoped from them, than obedience to an order for ta-

things would so turn out, the scheme was judged im­

might be distinctly heard, and calling out aloud on

some persons to come forth, since they were a party sent

from his friends in Syracuse to bring Nicias some intelli­

gence, charged them to carry word immediately to Ni­

cias, u by no means to draw off the army by night,

"because the Syracusans had beset the roads; but to

*' defer his march till day-light, when he had leisure to  
*' make the proper dispositions." And after delivering  
this message they rode off, whilst those who received it

went and reported it faithfully to the Athenian generals.

Wrought upon by this piece of intelligence, in which

they were far from suspecting any fraud, they continued

all night in their posts; and then, as they had not dis­

stay there but one day longer, ,that the soldiers might

pack up and carry away with them as large a part as was

possible of their necessary stores. The rest of the baggage

were only to carry off, each person for himself, what

was absolutely necessary for food and raiment.
