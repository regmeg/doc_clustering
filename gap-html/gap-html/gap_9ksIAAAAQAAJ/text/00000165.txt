camp, had informed them of a piece of ground, con­

venient for their purpose, near Olympiæum.

In order therefore to accomplish the point, the gene­

rals have recourse to the following artifice. — They dis­

patch an emissary, of whose sidelity they were well

assured, and who might also pass with the generals of

Syracuse as well affected to their cause. The person

employed was a Catanean. He told them " he was

"sent by their friends in Catana," with whose names

they were acquainted and knew well to be of that num­

therefore were all the needful preparations adjusted, and

the time at hand at which they were to make their ap­

one night upon the banks of the Symæchus, in the

Leontine district. But the Athenians, when assured
