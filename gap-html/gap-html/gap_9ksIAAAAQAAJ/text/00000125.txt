B.VI. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 113

"might readily embrace, in order to render their con-

"dition more supportable. Nor is it, farther, to be

"presumed, that they will readily exchange their own

M liberty for subjection to us, as they are numerous, ac

"least for one island, and many of them inhabited by

"Grecians. For, without reckoning Naxus and Ca-

M tana, which I hope, upon account of their affinity to

** the Leontines, will side with us, there are no less than  
*' seven provided in all respects with as good martial ha-  
"biliments and stores as our own armies \ and more

"particularly those against which we chiefly bend our

"course, Selinus and Syracuse. These cities abound with

*' soldiers heavy-armed, with archers, and with darters.  
*' They have a great number of triremes, and plenty  
"of hands toman them. They possess a large quanti-

"ty of wealth, not only in private purses, but in their

"public treasuries. So rich are even the Selinuntians.

*' And to the Syracusans, farther, a tribute is paid by  
*' several barbarians. But the points, in which they  
'* most of all excel us, are, that numerous cavalry

"of which they are possessed, and corn of their own

*' growth sufficient to answer all demands without fo-  
*' reign importations. An armament, therefore, sini-  
"ply naval, will by no means be sufficient to cope with

"such a strength. A large land force must accompa-

"ny the naval, if we are desirous of performing such

"atchievements as may be worthy the greatnelsof our

"plan, and would not be debarred an opportunity

** of landing by their numerous cavalry. And this will  
*' be yet more needful, should the cities, alarmed at  
** our approach, combine together against us, and no  
'* other friends but the Egesteans join us, or supply us

"with a body of cavalry sufficient to countenance our

"landing. It would be a terrible disgrace, should we

"be compelled by force to give over our design, or to

*' send for a larger supply, as if our councils at first fet-  
"ting-out were rash and ill-concerted. We must steer

'* ar once against them with preparations in all respects
