been inlarged, whilst their annual revenue was constant­

ly decreasing.

Unwilling, therefore, in the present ebb of their trea­

sures, to defray the charge of this body of Thracians,

who came too late for Demosthenes, they sent them

back to their own country with all possible haste. Dii-

trephes was the person pitched upon to conduct them

home; and was instructed, that, " in the passage, (for

'* they were to go through theEuripus,) he should em-

"ploy them, if opportunity offered, against the ene-

** my." He landed therefore near Tanagra, and in a  
-hurrying manner carried off a booty from thence. A-  
bout the shut of evening he also crossed the Euripus

from Chalcis of Eubœa; and, having landed his Thra­

cians in Bœotia, led them against: Mycalessus. His de­

sign was not discovered that night, though he halted at

the temple of Mercury, which is distant from Mycales­

sus but * sixteen stadia at most. But, early the next

morning he assaulted this city, which is of large extent:

He carries it on the first attack, as there was no guard

to resist him, and the inhabitants could never have ima­

gined that a maritime body would have marched so far

into the country to make attempts upon them. The

wall, besides, was weak; in some places it was fallen,

and the remaining part of it was low; and the gates,

from too great a considence of security, had been left o-

pen. No sooner were the Thracians broke into Myca­

lessus, than they gutted both houses and temples; they

massacred the inhabitants, shewing no regard to either

old-age or youth, but venting their fury on all that

came in their way; they butchered even the women and

the children; nay, all the labouring cattle, and every

creature that had life which came before their eyes: For

the Thracians, when once their fury is inflamed, are as

insatiable of blood as any other the greatest savages in

the barbarian world. On this occasion the confusion

was terrible, and every ghastly method of destruction

• More thin a mile and a halt".
