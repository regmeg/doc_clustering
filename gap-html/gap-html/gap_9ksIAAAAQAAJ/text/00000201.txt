vent the Athenians from continuing their works quite

down to the sea. The latter, when they h id perfected

their work along the crag, are bent on demolishing the

new palisade and intrenchment of the Syracusans. For

this purpose, they had ordered their shipping to come

about from Thapsus into the great harbour or Syracuse.

They themselves, at the morning's dawn, marched

down from Epipolse into the plain; and then, crossing

the marsh, where the mud was hardest and best able to

bear, by the help of boards and planks which they laid

upon the surface, they carry almost the whole length

of the palisade and intrenchment early in the morning,

and were soon after masters of the whole. This was not

effected without a battle, in which the Athenians were

again victorious. The routed Syracusans fled different

ways; those, who had composed their right, towards

Syracusans, alarmed at this step, as this body consisted

of the bulk of their horse, face about on the three hun­

the right wing of the Athenians. By so unexpected a

shock the first band in thac wing was thrown into dis­

happened to be near him, and the whole body of the

Argrves. Having crossed a ditch that lay between, se­
