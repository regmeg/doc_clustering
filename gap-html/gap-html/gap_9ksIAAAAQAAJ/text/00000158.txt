timely revenge upon him, by whom they were aggrieved,

and on whole account they had en.barked into so dan­

gerous an affair. In this hurry of thought they rushed

back into the city, and met with Hipparchus at the

place called Leocorium; where, without any regard to.

their own safety, they made an instant assault upon him.

And thus, in all the fury of passion, one actuated by

jealousy, and the other by resentment, they wounded

and they kill him. As the people immediately ran to­

gether, Aristogiton by favour of the concourse escapes

for the present, but, being afterwards seized, was un­

suppressed on his countenance all fense of the calamity;

and, pointing to a certain spot, commanded them aloud

to throw down their arms and file off thither. This

command they obeyed, expecting he had some­

away those arms. He then picked out man by man,

Panatbcnaa. No slave was ever called by their names. Praxiteles was employed

to cast their statuei, which were afterwards set up in the forum: Xeries
