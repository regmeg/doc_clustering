B.V. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 3t

rinthians and Athenians, without any solemn ratifi­

cation.

This same summer, the Lacedæmonians took the

field with their whole united force, under the command

of Pleistionax, the son of Pausaoias, king of the Lace­

dæmonians, and marched to the Parrhasians of Arcadia.

These were subject to the Mantineans, and, in conse­

quence of a sedition, had invited this expedition. But

it was also designed, if possible, to demolish the fortress

of Cypscla, which the Mantineans had erected; and, as

it was situated in Parrhasia, towards the Skiritis of La-

conia, had placed a garrison imit. The Lacedæmo­

nians, therefore, ravaged the terricory of the Parrhasi­

ans. But the Mantineans, leaving their own city to the

guard of the Argives, marched themselves to the sup­

port of their dependents. But, finding it impossible to

preserve the fortress of Cypscla and the cities of the Par­

rhasians, they retired. The Lacedæmonians also, when

they had set the Parrhasians ac liberty, and demolished

the fortress, withdrew their forces. . .

The same summer also, upon the return from- Thrace

of those soldiers who had served under Brasidas, and

who came home after the peace under the conduct ot"

Clearidas, the Lacedæmonians decreed "those Helots,

"who had served under Brasidas, to be free, and to

*' have permission to reside wherever they pleased.'*  
And, no long time after, they placed them, together

with such persons as were newly enfranchised, at Lepre-

um: It is situated between Laconia and Elea; and- they

were now at variance with the Eleans. As for thoie

Spartans who had been made prisoners in Sphacteria, and

had delivered up their arms, conceiving some fears about

them, left, should they lay their late disgrace too much

to heart, as they were persons of the greatest rank, they

might introduce some innovations in the State, they de­

clared them infamous, even though some of the number

were, at this time, possessed of posts in the government.

But this infamy extended no farther than to disqualify

them
