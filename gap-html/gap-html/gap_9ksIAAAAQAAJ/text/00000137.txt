B.VI. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 115

*' were indebted to a parallel coincidence of events  
*' for the vast enlargement of their strength and empire,  
** when the Mede, who gave out that he aimed the blow  
*' at Athens, was, contrary to all human expectation,  
"disconcerted by a series of errors that were purely his

"own. And some such fortunate coincidence, in our

"own behalf, we have at present all imaginable rea-

"Let us therefore with active resolution put our do-

*' mined either secretly or openly, by some expedient  
»* or other, to vindicate our cause. And, were their

*' inclination equal to their power, no people on the

"sesied of an immensity of wealth, which gives an easy

"and prompt completion to the schemes of war and to

"every human enterprize. Let us send, farther, to La-

*' cedæmon and Corinth, requesting the dispatch of  
*' immediate succours hither, and the renewal of the war  
'* against the Athenians.

"There is one point more, which in my opinion is

"more critical and important than all the rest: and
