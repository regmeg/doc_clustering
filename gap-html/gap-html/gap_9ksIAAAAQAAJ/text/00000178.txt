j66 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VI.

** are bound to give defensive aid to the Athenians  
** when attacked by others, and not when they (as is  
** the present case) injuriously fall upon your neigh-  
** bours. Remember that the Rhegians, though even  
** of Chalcidic descent, have refused to concur with

them in replanting the Leontines, who are also Chal-

** cideans. Hard, indeed, is your fate, if they, fus-  
** pecting some bad design to lie lurking under a fair  
** justification, have recourse to the wary moderate be-  
** haviour which appearances will not warrant; whilst  
** you, on the pretended ground of a rational conduct:,  
*t are eager to serve a people who are by nature your  
"foes; and join with most; implacable enemies to de-

** stroy your own kindred, to whom nature hath Ib  
** closely attached you 1

"In such a conduct; there is no justice: The justice

"lies in abetting our cause, and not dastardly shrinking

"before the terror of their arms. These arms are not

"terrible, would we only all combine in our mutual

"defencei they are only so, if, on the contrary, we con-

"tinue disunited, the point which the Athenians la-

"bour with so much assiduity. For, even when sin-

** g'y against Us they entered the lists, and were victo-  
** rious, yet they were not able to effectuate their de*  
** signs, but were obliged precipitacely to re-embark.  
** If united, therefore, what farther can we have to  
** fear? What hinders us from associating together  
** with instant alacrity and zeal? especially as we  
** soon shall receive an aid from Peloponnesus, who in  
** all the business of war are far superior to Athenians.  
** Reject, I fay, the vain presumption, that either it  
** will be equitable in regard to us, or prudential in re-  
** gard to yourselves, to take part with neither fide* on  
** pretence that you have treaties subsisting with both:  
** There is a fallacy in it, which, though veiled under  
** plausible words, the event will soon detect. For if,  
"through your determination to abandon his support,

J* the party already attacked be vanquished, and the

** assailant
