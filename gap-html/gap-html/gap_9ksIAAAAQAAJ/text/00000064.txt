52 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.V,

the Argives were now the chief managers of the tem­

ple. But, this pretended grievance let apart, it had

been judged expedient, by Alcibiades and the Argives,

to get possession, if possible, of Epidaurus, in order to

prevent molestation on the side of Corinth, and to ren­

der the passage of Athenian succours more expeditious

from Ægina than by setching a compass about Scyllæ-

um. The Argives, therefore, were intent on their pre­

parations, as resolved to take the field and act against

Epidaurus, in order to exact the victim by force

of arms.

Bur, about the fame time, the Lacedæmonians also

marched out, with their whole force, as sar as to Leuc-

tra, upon their own frontier, towards Lyceum, under

the command of Agis, the son of Archidamus, their

king. Not a man was privy to the design of their thus

taking the field, not even the States from which the

quotas were furnished out. But, when the victims

they sacrificed for a successful campaign proved inauspi­

cious, they again marched home, and circulated fresh

orders to their consederates to be ready to take the field

again after the next month, which was the month Car-

ndus,-f- the grand festival of the Dorians. But, when

they were thus withdrawn, the Argives, taking the

field on the twenty-seventh day of the month preceding

Carneius, and though celebrating their own festival thac

very day, continued all this intermediate time to make

incursions and ravages upon Epidauria. The Epidau-

rians sent about to solicit the succours of their allies j

fome of whom excused themselves as bound to observe

the approaching sestivals, though others advanced as

•f This festival was observed by most cities in Greece; but with the greatest

pomp and solemnity at Sparta, where it began the thirteenth of the month
Carneius-,

according to the Lacedæmonian stile, and lasted nine days. A camp was formed
for

its celebration, in wlich they continued during the whole solemnity, and
observed

fliict military discipline. By these means, as we find a little lower, the
Argives,

i n this instance no slaves to superstition, attended to the festival and
warfare at the same

time, and anrojcd the Epidaurians, whilst religions awe restrained the friends
of th*

latter siotii acting in their deser.ee. See PnV.tr 's ArtbanUgia, vol, i, p.
