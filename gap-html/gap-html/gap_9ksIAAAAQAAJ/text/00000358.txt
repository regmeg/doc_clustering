346 THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. B.VIII.

"dons, for the sake of which alone the troops abroad

"were submissive to the orders of the State at home.

** Nay, in some points those at Athens had most egre-  
"gioufly offended, since they had overturned the Jaws

** of their country, which those here had preserved, and  
** were exerting their efforts to compel others to the oh.  
".servance of them; and therefore, in every method

"of valuation, the men, who here provided well for

"the public welfare, were in no respect worse patriots

*' than the men at Athens. Even Alcibiades, sliould  
*' they grant him an indemnity and a <afe return,  
*' would readily procure them the king's alliance. And,  
** what had the greatest weight, should they mifcarry  
.** in every branch of their present designs, many pla-

** ces of refuge lay always open to men possessed of so  
4' considerable a fleet, in which they might find fresh

"cities and another country."

After such occurrences in the aflembly convened by

the soldiery, and theconclusion of their mutual exhor­

tations, they continued their preparations for war with

unremitting diligence. But the deputation of ten, sent

from the four hundred to Sacnos, being informed of these

proceedings when they were advanced in their voyage

io far as Dek>s, thought proper to proceed no farther.

About 'this very time, the iPelopownesiaos on-board

the fleet stationed at Miletus clangoured loudly amongst

themselves, that *' they are betrayed toy Aftyocbus and

** Tifiaphernes; as the former had already .refused to  
*' engage, when themselves were hearty and in fine  
"condition, and the fleet of the Athenians was small j

** nor would do so even now, when <the latter are repor-  
M ted lo be embroiled with intestine seditions, andtheir

*' own ships are daily impairing; but, under pretextof a  
** Phœnician fleet to be brought up by Tifiaphernes,  
"an aid merely nominal, and which would never join

•** them, he was ruining all by dilatory measures. And,

•*' as for Tifiaphernes, it was never his intention to bring

** up chat Atti't but^»e was p-lainly undermining the

** strength
