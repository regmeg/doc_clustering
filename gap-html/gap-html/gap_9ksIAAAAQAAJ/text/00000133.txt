B.VI. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. ill

every mariner was a * drachma a day. The number of

new ships for the battle and chace was sixty; that of

transports for the heavy-armed, forty. The several

captains of the triremes were very choice in making up

their crews, and gave to such of the mariners as rowed

on the uppermost bench, and to the sailors, a gratuity out

of their own pockets over and above the public pay.

They had farther adorned their vessels with images and

all kind of sumptuous decorations. It was the high

ambition of every single captain, to have his own ship

excel all the rest of the fleet in splendor and in swiftness.

The land-force was distinguished by the choiceness of

their levies and their arms and all the individuals vied

with one another in the goodness of their accoutrements

and equipage whatsoever. It happened also on the same

account that a warm contention was kindled amongst:

them, under what officers they should be ranged; and

opportunity afforded, to the rest of Greece, to construe

the whole into a mere ostentation of their power and

opulence rather than an effective equipment against a

foe. For, were a computation to be formed, both of

the public disbursements of the State on this occasion,

and the private expences of the whole soldiery ; — of the

State, what prodigious sums they had already advanced,

and what additional sums the generals were to carry along

with them; — of the soldiery, what each had expen­

ded on his own equipage, every captain on the decora­

tion of his vessel, and to how much greater charges he

was still liable; — without taking into the account the

vast list of necessaries which, over and above the public

allowance, each private person was obliged to lay in for

so long a voyage, or the goods which a soldier or trader

might take with himon-board for the sake of traffic;-—

the amount of talents now carried out of Athens would

turn out exceeding large.

Nor was it merely for the strangeness of the enterprize

or the splendor of its shew, that the armament was noised

abroad,
