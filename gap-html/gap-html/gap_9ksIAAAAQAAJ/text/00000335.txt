B.VIH. THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR. 323

he pleaded " the candour of Astyochus in his own ex-

"cuse, if he desired in this manner to ruin his mortal

** foe, though with some prejudice to the welfare of his  
*' country." But Astyochus had given up all thoughts  
"of putting Alcibiades to death, especially as now he

never came within his reach; yet, on this occasion,

making a visit to him and Tissaphernes at Magnesia,

he communicates to them the advices sent him from Sa­

Astyochus communicates to Alcibiades.

Phrynichus, perceiving in time that Astyochus be­

trayed him, and that notice each moment was only not

arrived from Alcibiades about the contents of his last,

anticipated the discovery, and becomes himself informer

ro the army, that, " the . enemy had resolved, as Sa-
