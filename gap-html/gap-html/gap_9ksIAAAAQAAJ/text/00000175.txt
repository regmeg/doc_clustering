B.VI. THE PELOPONNESlAN WAR* i6|

** establishing a Sicilian people; or, by the bonds  
"of consanguinity, hold themselves obliged to protect

"the Leontines, who are of Chalcidic descent, whilst

** on the Chalcideans of Eubœa, from whom these o-  
* * thers are a colony, they hold fast-rivetted the yoke  
"of flavery? No j it is the fame cruel policy, that

** subjugated the Grecians in that part of the world,  
** which now exerts itself to glut their ambition in this.

** These are those very Athenians, who formerly, ha-  
** ving been elected their common leaders by the well.  
** designing Ionians and that confederate body which  
** derived from them their descent, on the glorious pre-  
** tence of avenging themselves on the Persian mo-  
** narch, abused their trust by inflaving thole who pla-  
* * ced considence in them; charging some with deiert-  
** ihg the common cause, others with their mutual em-  
** broilments, and all, at length, wich difserent but fpe-  
** cious criminations. And, on the whole, these Athe-  
"nians waged war against the Mede, not in the cause

"of Grecian liberty, as neither did the other Grecians

** in the defence of their own: The former fought, not  
'* indeed to subject the rest of Greece to the Mede, but

** to their own selves; the latter, merely to obtain a  
"change of master j a master not inferior in policy, but

** far more abundant in malice.

"But, though Athens, on manifold accounts, be ob-

** noxious to universal censure and reproach, yet we are  
"not come hither to prove how justly she deserveth it,

** since your own conviction precludes the long detail.  
** We are much more conceined at present to censure  
** and reproach ourselves, since, with all the example*  
** before our eyes of what the'Grecians in those parts  
** have sufsered, who, for want of guarding against their  
** incroachments, have fallen victims to their ambition,
