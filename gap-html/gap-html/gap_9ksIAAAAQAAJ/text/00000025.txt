B.V. THE PELO'PONNESIAN WAti. tj|

It so fell out indeed, immediately after the battle of

Amphipolis and the return of Ramphias from Thessaiy,

that neither of the parties meddled any longer with thi

operations of war, but were more inclined to a peace.

The motives on the Athenian side were these;—They

had received a terrible blow at Delium, and a second

lately at Amphipolis: Hence they no longer entertain­

ed that assured considence of their own strength, which

had formerly occasioned them to reject all accOmmoda-1

tions, as they imagined, in their then career of success,

they should soon give law to their enemies. Now also

they were under apprehensions of their dependents, lest,

buoyed up by the late misfortunes of Athens, they

might the sooner be induced to revolt. And they

heartily repented now, that they had neglected the fine

opportunity, which their success at Pylus gave them, of

On the other hand, the Lacedæmonians acted on

these motives: — They found themselves strangely mis­

tions now were extended over all their country, from

Pylus and Cythera. Their Helots had also in numbers

deserted to the foe; and they lived in constant expec­

tation that those, who yet persevered in their allegiance,

gained by the solicitations of those who were fled,

might, in the present low ebb of Sparta, attempt to

subvert their constitution, as had formerly been the

case. It happened farther, that the thirty years truce

with the Argives was on the point of expiring; and the

Argiv.es were unwilling to renew it, unless the Cynuria

was previously restored. They judged it therefore a

plain impossibility, to make head, at the fame time, a-

gainst both Argives and Athenians. They had alia a
