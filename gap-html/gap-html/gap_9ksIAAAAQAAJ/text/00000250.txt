against drawing off the army. He told them, " he

** was perfectly well affined that the Athenians would  
"never forgive him, should he carry their troops from

"Sicily without peremptory orders: That the affair

** would not then lie under the cognizance of such as  
'** here advised it, and with their own eyes were con-

** vineed of Che necessity of such .a step; but of men  
* * who would form their judgements upon the spiteful  
** calumniations of others, and the influence some ma-  
"Hcious demagogues would have over their under-

"standings, by which their fate would be determined."

-He farther represented, that ** many, nay, the greater  
** part of the soldiers, who now farmed the troops, and  
make such tragical outcries ,about ahe perils that en-

** viron them at present, would change their notes so  
'** foon as they were landed again at Athens, and as-

** cribe their return to the treachery and corruption of  
** their commanders." For such reafons, he declared,  
"as he was well acquainted with Athenian tempers,

** he would choose, rather than be undone at Athens  
'* by base criminations and an unjust sentence, to ha-

** zard the last extremity, and perish, if so it must be,  
'* under the violence, of the enemy." He maintained,

however, that " the state of the Synacu sans was worse

** than their own. The demand upon them ffor the  
** pay of foreigners was large; their expences in secu-  
"ring the outworks of Syracuse were nigh: they had

** now supported a large navy for thespace of an en-  
* * tire year; want theresore must soon come upon them,  
"and they must shortly be tocally distressed; because

** the sum of * two thousand .talents they had already  
** expended of their .own stook, and had even con-  
"tracted a large debt beside. And, in case they a-

** bate of their present.punctuality or making good the  
** appointments of the forces they have on foot, their  
** strength must moulder away; since it consisted, not  
** like the Athenians, of troops which must serve, but
