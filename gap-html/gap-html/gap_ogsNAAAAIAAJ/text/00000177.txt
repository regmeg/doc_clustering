C. III.] SNARES FOR THE ROMANS. 171

if they had been ejec'H out of the city by those who were

for peace, and rambled ;il>out as if they were afraid of being

assaulted by the Romans, and were in fear of one another;

while those that stood upon the wall, and seemed to be of the

people's side, cried out aloud for peace, and entreated that

they might have security for their lives given them, and called

for the Romans, promising to open their gates to them; and

as they cried out after that manner, they threw stones at

their own people, as though they would drive them away from

the gates. These also pretended that they were excluded by

force, and that they petitioned those that were within to let

them in ; and rushing upon the Romans perpetually, with

violence, they then came back, and seemed to be in great

disorder. Now the Roman soldiers thought this cunning

stratagem of theirs was to be believed real, and thinking they

had the one party under their power, and could punish them

as they pleased, and hoping that the other party would open

their gates to them, set to the execution of their designs ac­

prevented him, and catching up their arms ran to the gates;

whereupon those that seemed to have been ejected at the first

retired ; but as soon as the soldiers were gotten between the

towers on each side of the gate, the Jews ran out, and en­

compassed them round, and fell upon them behind, while that

multitude which stood upon the wall threw a heap of stones

and darts of all kinds at them, insomuch that they slew a

considerable number, and wounded many more; for it was

not easy for the Romans to escape, by reason those behind

them pressed them forward; besides which, the shame they

were under for being mistaken, and the fear they were in of

their commanders, engaged them to persevere in their mis­

take : wherefore they fought with their spears a great while,

and received many blows from the Jews, though, indeed, they
