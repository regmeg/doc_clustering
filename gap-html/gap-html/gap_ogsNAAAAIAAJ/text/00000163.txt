C. I.] SEDITIONS AT JERUSALEM. 157

anco in the great distresses they were in, having in his power

the upper city and a great part of the lower, did now make

more vehement assaults upon John and his party, because

they were fought against from above also ; yet was ho beneath

their situation when he attacked them, as were they beneath

the attacks of the others above them: whereby it came to

pass, that John did both receive and inflict great damage,

and that easily, as he was fought against on both sides ; and

the same advantage that Eleazar and his party had over him,

since he was beneath them, the same advantage had he, by

his higher situation, over Simon. On which account he easily

repelled the attacks that were made from beneath, by the

weapons thrown from their hands only; but was obliged to

repel those that threw their darts from the temple above him,

by his engines of war; for he had such engines as threw

darts, and javelins, and stones, and that in no small number,

by which he did not only defend himself from such as fought

against him, but slew moreover many of the priests as they

were about their sacred ministrations. For notwithstanding

these men were mad with all sorts of impiety, yet did they

still admit those that desired to offer their sacrifices, although

they took care to search the people of their own country be­

forehand, and both suspected and watched them ; while they

were not so much afraid of strangers, who, although they had

gotten leave of them, how cruel soever they were, to come

into that court, were yet often destroyed, by this sedition;

for those darts that were thrown by the engines came with

that force that they went over all the buildings, and reached

as far as the altar, and the temple itself, and fell upon the

priests, and those' that were about the sacred offices: inso­

much that many persons who came thither with great zeal

from the ends of the earth to offer sacrifices at this celebrated

place, which was esteemed holy by all mankind, fell down

before their own sacrifices themselves, and sprinkled that

altar which was venerable among all men, both Greeks and

Barbarians, with their own blood; till the dead bodies of

strangers were mingled together with those of their own
