202 THE ROMANS TAKE THE SECOND WALL. [B. V.

think that the Romans would never venture to come into tho

city any more; and that, if they kept within it themselves,

they should not be any more conquered. For God had blinded

their minds for the transgressions they had been guilty of,

nor could they see how much greater forces the Romans had

than those that were now expelled, no more than they could

discern how a famine was creeping upon them; for hitherto

they had fed themselves out of tho public miseries, and drank

the blood of the city. But now poverty had for a long time

seized upon the better part, and a great many had already

died for want of necessaries ; although the seditious, indeed,

supposed the destruction of the people to be an easement to

themselves, for they desired that none others might be preÂ­

served but such as were against a peace with the Romans, and

were resolved to live in opposition to them; and they were

pleased when the multitude of those of a contrary opinion were

consumed, as being then freed from a heavy burden. And

this was their disposition of mind with regard to those that

were within the city, while they covered themselves with their

armor, and prevented the Romans when they were trying to

get into the city again, and made a wall of their own bodies

over against that part of tho wall that was cast down. Thus

did they valiantly defend themselves for three days; but on

the fourth day they could not support themselves against the

vehement assaults of Titus, but were compelled by force to fly

whither they had fled before ; so he quietly possessed himself

again of that wall, and demolished it entirely. And when he

had put a garrison into the towers that were on the south parts

of the city, he contrived how he might assault the third wall.
