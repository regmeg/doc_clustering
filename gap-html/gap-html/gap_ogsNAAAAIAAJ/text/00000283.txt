C. VI.] THE ROHAN ENSIGNS. 277

Jews took this prediction to belong to themselves in particular,

and many of the wise men were thereby deceived in their de­

termination. Now this oracle certainly denoted the govern­

ment of Vespasian, who was appointed emperor in Judea.

However, it is not possible for men to avoid fate, although

they seo it beforehand. But these men interpreted some

of these signals according to their own pleasure, and some

of them they utterly despised^ until their madness was de­

monstrated both by the taking of their city and their own

destruction.

CHAPTER VI.

HOW THE ROMANS CARRIED THEIR ENSIGNS TO THE TEMPLE,

AND MADE JOYFUL ACCLAMATIONS TO TITUS. THE SPEECH

THAT TITUS' MADE TO THE JEWS WHEN THEY MADE SUPPLI­

CATION FOR MERCY. WHAT REPLY THEY MADE THERETO,

AND HOW THAT REPLY MOVED TITUS'S INDIGNATION AGAINST

into the city, and upon the burning of the holy house itself,

and of all the buildings round about it, brought their ensigns

to the temple,' and set them over against its eastern gate;

and there did they offer sacrifices to them, and there did they

And now all the soldiers had such vast quantities of the spoils

which they had gotten by plunder, that in Syria a pound

weight of gold was sold for half its former value. But as for

those priests that kept themselves still upon the wall of the holy

'Take Havercamp's note here. — "This," says he, "is a remarkable

place:" and Tcrtullian truly says in his Apologetic, ch. xvi. p. 162, that "
tho

entire religion of tho Roman camp almost consisted in worshipping the en­

signs, in swearing by the ensigns, and in preferring the ensigns before all

the [other] gods." See what Havercamp says upon that place of Tertullian.

5 This declaring Titus Imperator by the soldiers, upon such signal success,

and the slaughter of such a vast number of enemies, was according to the

usual practice of the Romans in like cases, as Reland assures ua on this

place.
