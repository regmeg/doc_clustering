JOSEPHUS'S DISCOURSE ABOUT HADES. 459

committed all judgment; and he in order to fulfil the will

of his Father shall come as judge, whom we call Christ. For

Minos and Rhadamanthus are not the judges, as you Greeks

do suppose, but he whom God and the Father hath glorified ;

CONCERNING WHOM WE IIAVE ELSEWHERE GIVEN A MORE PAR­

TICULAR ACCOUNT, FOR THE SAKE OF THOSE WHO SEEK AFTER

truth. This person, exercising the righteous judgment of

the Father towards all men, hath prepared a just sentence

for every one, according to his works; at whose judgment-

seat, when all men, and angels, and demons, shall stand,

they will send forth one voice, and say, just is thy judg­

ment: the rejoinder to which will bring a just sentence upon

both parties, by giving justly to those that have done well

an everlasting fruition ; but allotting to the lovers of wicked

works eternal punishment. To these belong the unquench­

able fire, and that without end, and a certain fiery worm never

dying, and not destroying the body, but continuing its

eruption out of the body with never-ceasing grief: neither

will sleep give ease to theso men, nor will the night afford

them comfort: death will not free them from their punish­

ment, nor will the interceding prayers of their kindred profit

them; for the just are no longer seen by them, nor are they

thought worthy of remembrance. But the just shall remember

only their righteous actions, whereby they have attained the

heavenly kingdom, in which there is no sleep, no sorrow, no

corruption, no care, no night, no day measured by time: no

sun driven in his course along the circle of heaven by

necessity, and measuring out the bounds and. conversions of

the seasons, for the better illumination of the life of men;

no moon decreasing and increasing, or introducing a variety

of seasons, nor will she then moisten the earth : no burning

sun, no Bear turning round [the pole], no Orion to rise, no

wandering of innumerable stars. The earth will not then

be difficult to be passed over; nor will it be hard to find out

the court of paradise; nor will there be any fearful roaring

of the sea, forbidding the passengers to walk on it; even

that will be made easily passable to the just, though it will

not be void of moisture. Heaven will not then be uninhabit­
