244 THE ROMANS ASSAULT [B. VI.

were on the fore-front, and kept watch upon the banks, got

together, and called to them the standard-bearer of the fifth

legion, and two others of a troop of horsemen, and one trum足

peter : these went without noise, about the ninth hour of the

night, through the ruins, to the tower of Antonia ; and when

they had cut the throats of the first guards of the place, as

they were asleep, they got possession of the wall, and ordered

the trumpeter to sound his trumpet: upon which the rest of

the guard got up on the sudden, and ran away, before any

body could see how many there were that were gotten up;

for partly from the fear they were in, and partly from the

tower of Antonia; in which battle the darts were on both

sides useless, as well as the spears, and both sides drew their

swords, and fought it out hand to hand. Now, during this

struggle, the positions of the men were undistinguished on

both sides, and they fought at random, the men being inter足

mixed one with another, and confounded, by reason of the

narrowness of the place; while the noise that was made fell

on the car after an indistinct manner, because it was so very

loud. Great slaughter was now made on both sides, and the
