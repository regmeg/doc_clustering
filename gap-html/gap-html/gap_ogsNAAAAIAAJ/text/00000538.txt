5C2 DISSERTATION III.

me that the main of their fault, or of their mistake, was this—

that they were wont, on a stated day, to meet together before

it was light, and to sing a hymn to Christ, as a god, alter­

nately ; and to oblige themselves by a sacrament [or oath,]

not to do any thing that was ill, but that they would commit

no theft, or pilfering, or adultery ; that they would not break

their promises, or deny what was deposited with them, when

it was required back again: after which it was their custom

to depart, and to meet again at a common but innocent meal,1

which yet they had left off upon that edict which I published

at your command, and wherein I had forbidden any such con­

venticles. These examinations made me think it necessary

to inquire by torments what the truth was, which I did of two

servant maids, which were called deaconesses ; but still I dis­

covered no more than that they were addicted to a bad and

an extravagant superstition. Hereupon I have put off any

farther examinations, and have recourse to you; for the affair

seems to be well worth consultation, especially on account of

the number of those that are in danger;2 for there are many

of every age, of every rank, and of both sexes, which are now

and hereafter likely to be called to account, and to be in

danger; for this superstition is spread like a contagion, not

only into cities and towns, but irrtrrcountry villages also, which

yet there is reason-toTiopc may be stopped and corrected. To

be sure, the temples, which were almost forsaken, begin already

to be frequented ; and the holy solemnities, which were long

intermitted, begin to be revived. The sacrifices begin to sell

well everywhere, of which very few purchasers had of late

appeared; whereby it is easy to suppose how great a multi­

tude of men may be amended, if place for repentance be

admitted.

1 This must most probably be the/«aj< of charily.

* Some of late are very loath to believe that the Christians were numerous  
in the second century ; but this is such an evidence that they were very nu­

merous, at least in Bithynia, even in the beginning of that century, as is

wholly undeniable.
