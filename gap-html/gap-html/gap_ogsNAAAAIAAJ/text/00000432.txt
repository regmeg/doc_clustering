heaven, and earth, and sea, to bear no good-will to any

foreigner, and particularly to none of the Greeks." Now

this liar ought to have said directly, that " we would bear no

good-will to any foreigner, and particularly to none of the

Egyptians." For then his story about the oath would have

squared with the rest of his original forgeries, in case our

forefathers had been driven away by their kinsmen, the

Egyptians, not on account of any wickedness they had been

guilty of, but on account of the calamities they were under;

for as to the Grecians, we were rather remote from them in

place than different from them in our institutions ; insomuch

that we have no enmity with them, nor any jealousy of them.

On the contrary, it hath so happened, that many of them

have come over to our laws, and some of them have continued

in their observation, although others of them had not courage

enough to persevere, and so departed from them again; nor

did any body ever hear this oath sworn by us: Apion, it

seems, was the only person that heard it, for he, indeed, was

the first composer of it.

prudence, as to what I am going to say, which is this, that

"there is a plain mark among us, that we neither have just

laws, nor worship God as we ought to do, because we are not

governors, but are rather in subjection to Gentiles, sometimes

to one nation and sometimes to another; and that our city

hath been liable to several calamities, while their city

[Alexandria] hath been of old time an imperial city, and

not used to be in subjection to the Romans." But now this

man had better leave off his bragging; for every body but

himself would think that Apion said what he hath said against

himself; for there are very few nations that have had the

good fortune to continue many generations in the principality,

but still the mutations in human affairs have put them into

subjection under others; and most nations have been often

subdued and brought into subjection by others. Now for

the Egyptians, perhaps, they are the only nation that have

had this extraordinary privilege, to have never served any

of those monarchs who subdued Asia and Europe, and this
