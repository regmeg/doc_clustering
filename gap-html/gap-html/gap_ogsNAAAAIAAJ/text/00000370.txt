to these books of our own nation, is evident by what we do;

for during so many ages as have already passed, no one hath

been so bold as either to add any thing to them, to take any

thing from them, or to make any change in them; but it is

become natural to all Jews, immediately and from their very

birth, to esteem these books to contain divine doctrines, and

to persist in them, and, if occasion be, willingly to die for

them. For it is no new thing for our captives, many of them

in number, and frequently in time, to be seen to endure racks

and deaths of all kinds upon the theatres, that they may not

be obliged to say one word against our laws, or the records

that contain them; whereas there are none at all among the

Greeks who would undergo the least harm on that account,

no, nor in case all the writings that are among them were to

be destroyed; for they take them to be such discourses as arc

and they have justly the same opinion of the ancient writers,

since they see some of the present generation bold enough to

write about such affairs wherein they were not present, nor

had concern enough to inform themselves about them from

those that knew them; examples of which may be had in this

late war of ours, where some persons have written histories,

and published them, without having been in the places con足

but these men put a few things together by hearsay, and in足

solently abuse the world, and call these writings by the name

of Histories.

9. As for myself, I have composed a true history of that

whole war, and of all the particulars that occurred therein,

as having been concerned in all its transactions; for I acted

as general of those among us that are named Galileans, as

long as it was possible for us to make any opposition. I was

then seized on by the Romans, and became a captive; Ves足

pasian also and Titus had me kept under a guard, and forced

me to attend them continually. At the first I was put into

bonds, but was set at liberty afterward, and sent to accom足

pany Titus, when he came from Alexandria to the siege of

Jerusalem; during which time there was nothing done which
