480 DISSERTATION I.

Christ; nay, while his testimonies of John the Baptist and

of James the Just are so honorable, and give them so great

characters, it is also impossible that his testimony concerning

Christ should be other than very honorable, or such as afforded

him a still greater character also. Could the very same author,

who gave such a full and advantageous character of John the

Baptist, the forerunner of Jesus of Nazareth, all whose disci­

ples were by him directed to Jesus of Nazareth, as to the true

Messias, and all of whom became afterwards the disciples of

Jesus of Nazareth, say nothing honorable of that Jesus of Na­

zareth himself; and this in a history of those very times in

which he was born and lived, and died, and that while the

writer lived but a little after him in the same country in which

he was born, and lived, and died ? This is almost incredible.

And further, could the very same author, who gave such an

advantageous character of James the Just, and this under the

very appellation of James the brother of Jesus, who was called

Christ, which James was one of the principal disciples or

apostles of this Jesus Christ, and had been many years the

only Christian bishop of the believing Jews of Judea and Je­

rusalem, in the very days, and in the very country of this

writer; could he, I say, wholly omit any, nay, a very honor­

able account of Jesus Christ himself, whose disciple and bishop

this James most certainly was ? This is also almost incredible.

Hear what Ittigius, one of the wisest and learnedest of all those

who have lately inclined to give up the testimony concerning

Christ, as it stands in our copies, for spurious, says upon this

occasion:—"If any one object to me, that Josephus hath

not omitted John the Baptist, the forerunner of Christ, nor

James the disciple of Christ, and that therefore he could not

have done the part of a good historian, if he had been entirely

silent concerning Christ, I shall freely grant that Josephus

was not entirely silent concerning Christ; nay, I shall further

grant, that when Josephus was speaking of Christ, he did not

abstain from his commendation; for we are not to determine

from that inveterate hatred which the modern Jews bear to

Christ, what was the behavior of those Jews, upon whom the

miracles that were daily wrought by the apostles in the name

of Christ imprinted a sacred horror."
