112 CRUKLTY OF [B. IV.

burial, although the Jews used to take so much care of the

burial of men, that they took down those that were condemned

and crucified, and buried them before the going down of the

sun. I should not mistake if I said that the death of Ananus

was the beginning of the destruction of the city, and that

from this very day may be dated the overthrow of her wall

and the ruin of her affairs, whereon they saw their high-

priest, and the procurer of their preservation, slain in the

midst of their city. He was on other accounts also a vene­

rable and a very just man ; and besides the grandeur of that

nobility, and dignity, and honor, of which he was possessed,

he had been a lover of a kind of parity, even with regard to

the meanest of the people: he was a prodigious lover of

liberty, and an admirer of democracy in government, and did

ever prefer the public welfare before his own advantage, and

preferred peace above all things; for he was thoroughly

sensible that the Romans were not to be conquered. He

also foresaw that of necessity a war would follow; and that

unless the Jews made up matters with them very dexterously,

they would be destroyed: to say all in a word, if Ananus

had survived, they had certainly compounded matters ; for he

was a shrewd man in speaking and persuading the people,

and had already gotten the mastery of those that opposed

his designs, or were for the war. And the Jews had then put

abundance of delays in the way of the Romans, if they had

had such a general as he was. Jesus was also joined with

him, and although he were inferior to him upon the com­

parison, he was superior to the rest; and I cannot but think

that it was because God had doomed this city to destruction

as a polluted city, and resolved to purge his sanctuary by

fire, that he cut off these their great defenders and well-

wishers ; while those that a little before had worn the sacred

garments, and had presided over the public worship,1 and had

been esteemed venerable by those that dwelt on the whole

habitable earth when they came into our city, wero cast out
