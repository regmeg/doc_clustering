JOSEPHUS'S DISCOURSE ABOUT HADES. 457

3. For there is one descent into this region, at whose gate

we helieve there stands an archangel with a host; which gate

when those pass through that are conducted down by the

angels appointed over souls, they do not go the same way;

but the just are guided to the right hand, and are led with

hymns, sung by the angels appointed over that place, unto a

region of light, in which the just have dwelt from the

beginning of the world; not constrained by necessity, but

ever enjoying the prospect of the good things they see, and

rejoicing in the expectation of those new enjoyments which

will be peculiar to every one of them, and esteeming those

things beyond what we have here : with whom there is no

place of toil, no burning heat, no piercing cold, nor any

briars there; but the countenance of the fathers and of the

just, which they see, always smiles upon them, while they

wait for that rest and eternal new life in heaven which is to

succeed this region. This place we call the bosom of Abraham.

left hand by the angels allotted for punishment, no longer

going with a good-will, but as prisoners driven by violence ;

to whom are sent the angels appointed over them to reproach

them, and threaten them with their terrible looks, and to

thrust them still downward. Now those angels that are set

over these souls drag them into the neighborhood of hell

itself; who, when they are hard by it, continually hear the

noise of it, and do not stand clear of the hot vapor itself; but

when they have a near view of this spectacle, as of a terrible

and exceeding great prospect of fire, they are struck with a

fearful expectation of a future judgment, and in effect

punished thereby: and not only so, but where they see the

place [or choir] of the fathers and of the just, even hereby

are they punished; for a chaos deep and large is fixed

between them; insomuch that a just man that hath com­

passion upon them cannot be admitted, nor can one that is

unjust, if he were bold enough to attempt it, pass over it.

5. This is the discourse concerning Hades, wherein the

souls of all men are confined until a proper season, which

Gcd hath determined, when he will mako a resurrection of
