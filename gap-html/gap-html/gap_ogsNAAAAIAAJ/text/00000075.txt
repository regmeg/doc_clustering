by sea, for their ships were small and fitted only for piracy;

they were too weak to fight with Vespasian's vessels, and the

mariners that were in them were so few, that they were afraid

to come near the Romans, who attacked them in great

numbers. However, as they sailed round about the vessels,

and sometimes as they came near them, they threw stones at

the Romans, when they were a good way off, or came closer

and fought them; yet did they receive the greatest harm

themselves in both cases. As for the stones they threw at

the Romans, they only made a sound one after another ; for

they threw them against such as were in their armor, while

the Roman darts could reach the Jews themselves; and when

they ventured to come near the Romans they became sufferers

themselves, before they could do any harm to the other, and

were drowned, they and their ships together. As for those

that endeavored to come to an actual fight, the Romans ran

many of them through with their long poles. Sometimes the

Romans leaped into their ships with swords in their hands,

and slew them; but when some of them met the vessels, the

Romans caught them by the middle, and destroyed at once

their ships, and themselves who were taken in them. And

for such as were drowning in the sea, if they lifted their

heads up above the water, they were either killed by darts or

caught by the vessels; but if, in the desperate case they were

in, they attempted to swim to their enemies, the Romans cut

off either their heads or their hands : and, indeed, they were

destroyed after various manners every where, till the rest,

being put to flight, were forced to get upon the land, while

the vessels encompassed them about [on the sea:] but as

many of these were repulsed when they were getting ashore,

they were killed by the darts upon the lake; and the Romans

leaped out of their vessels, and destroyed a great many more

upon the land: one might then sec the lake all bloody and

full of dead bodies, for not one of them escaped. And a

terrible stink and a very sad sight there was on the following

days over that country; for as for the shores they were full

of shipwrecks, and of dead bodies all swelled; and as the

dead bodies were inflamed by the sun, and putrefied, they
