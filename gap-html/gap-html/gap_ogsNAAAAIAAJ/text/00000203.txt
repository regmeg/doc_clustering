C. VII.] EVENTS OF THE SIEGE. 197

the Romans. But when they fought them from the walls,

they were too hard for them ; the Romans being encouraged

by their power, joined to their skill, as were the Jews by

their boldness, which was nourished by the fear they were

in, and that hardiness which is natural to our nation under

calamities; they were also encouraged still by the hope of

deliverance, as were the Romans by their hopes of subduing

them in a little time. Nor did either side grow weary; but

attacks and fightings upon the wall, and perpetual sallies out

in bodies, were there all the day long; nor were there any

sort of warlike engagements that were not then put in use.

And the night itself had much ado to part them, when they

defeated, their constant wars, and perpetual warlike exercises,

and the grandeur of their dominion : and what was now their

chief encouragement, Titus, who was present every where

while Caesar was there, and fought bravely, as well as they

did, and was himself at once an eye-witness of such as beÂ­

haved themselves valiantly, and he who was to reward them

also. It was, besides, esteemed an advantage at present to

have any one's valor known by Coesar, on which account

many of them appeared to have more alacrity than strength

to answer it. And now, as the Jews were about this time

standing in array before the wall, and that in a strong body,
