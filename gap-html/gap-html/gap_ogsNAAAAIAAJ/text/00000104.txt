six thousand armed men, and placed them as guards in the

cloisters: so there was a succession of such guards one after

another, and every one was forced to attend in his course;

although many of the chief of the city were dismissed by those

that then took on them the government, upon their hiring

some of the poorer sort, and sending them to keep the guard

in their stead.

13. Now it was John who, as we told you, ran away from

Gischala, and was the occasion of all these heing destroyed.

He was a man of great craft, and bore about him in his soul

a strong passion after tyranny, and at a distance was the

adviser in these actions; and, indeed, at times he pretended

to be of the people's opinion, and went all about with Ananus,

reason to suspect of that discovery as this John; yet was it

not easy to get quit of him, so potent was he grown by his

wicked practices. He was also supported by many of those

eminent men, who were to be consulted upon all considerable

affairs; it was, therefore, thought reasonable to oblige him to

give them assurance of his good-will upon oath: accordingly,

John took such an oath readily, that he would be on the peo­

ple's side, and would not betray any of their counsels or prac­

tices to their enemies, and would assist them in overthrowing

those that attacked them, and that both by his hand and his
