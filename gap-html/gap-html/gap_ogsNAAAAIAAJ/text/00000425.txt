people of Rome: we also offer perpetual sacrifices for them;

nor do we only offer them every day at the common expense

of all the Jews, but although we offer no other such sacrifices

out of our common expenses, no not for our own children,

yet do we this as a peculiar honor to the emperors, and to

them alone, while we do the same to no other person whom­

soever.- And let this suffice for an answer in general to

Apion, as to what ho says with relation to the Alexandrian

Jews.

7. However, I cannot but admire those other authors who

furnished this man with such his materials; I mean Possido-

nius and Apollonius [the son of] Molo,1 who, while they ac­

cuse us for not worshipping the same gods whom others wor­

ship, they think themselves not guilty of impiety when they

tell lies of us, and frame absurd and reproachful stories about

our temple ; whereas it is a most shameful thing for free men

to forge lies on any occasion, and much more so to forge them

about our temple, which was so famous over all the world,

and was preserved so sacred by us; for Apion hath the im­

pudence to pretend, — " That the Jews placed an ass's head

in their holy place ;" and he affirms, — " That this was dis­

covered when Antiochus Epiphanes spoiled our temple, and

found that ass's head there made of gold, and worth a great

deal of money." To this my first answer shall be this: —

That had there been any such thing among us, an Egyptian

ought by no means to have thrown it in our teeth, since an

ass is not a more contemptible animal than ***2 and goats,

and other such creatures, which among them are gods. But,

besides this answer, I say farther, how comes it about tha

Apion does not understand this to be no other than a palpa­

ble lie, and to be confuted by the thing itself as utterly in­

credible ? For we Jews arc always governed by the same

laws, in which we constantly persevere; and although many

misfortunes have befallen our city, as the like have befallen

others, and although Theos [Epiphanes,] and Pompey the
