222 CLOSE FIGHTING. [B. V.

to their assistance; and as they were very bold upon the

good success they had had, their violent assaults were almost

irresistible: nay, they proceeded as far as the fortifications

of the enemies' camp, and fought with their guards. Now

there stood a body of soldiers in array before that camp,

which succeeded one another by turns in their armor; and

though they were already in a sort of prison. He then went

round about the enemy with some chosen troops, and fell upon

their flank himself; so the Jews, who had been before assaulted

in their faces, wheeled about to Titus, and continued the fight.

The armies also were now mixed one among another, and the

dust that was raised so far hindered them from seeing one

another, and the noise that was made so far hindered them
