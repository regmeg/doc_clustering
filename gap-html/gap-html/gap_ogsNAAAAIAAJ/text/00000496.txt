490 DISSERTATION I.

seen by Photius, as well as Justus of Tiberias, but in this

famous testimony before us, so that it is most probable

Photius not only had this testimony in his copy, but believed

it to be genuine al^o.

XI. As to the silence of Clement of Alexandria, who cites

the Antiquities of Josephus, but never cites any of the testi­

monies now before us, it is no strange thing at all, since he

never cites Josephus but once, and that for a point of chro­

nology only, to determine how many years had passed from

the days of Moses to the days of Josephus, so that his silence

may almost as well be alleged against a hundred other

remarkable passages in Josephus's works as against these

before us.

XII. Nor does the like silence of Tertullian imply that

these testimonies, or any of them, were not in the copies of

his age. Tertullian never once hints at any treatises of

Josephus's but those against Apion, and that in general only

for a point of chronology: nor does it any way appear that

Tertullian ever saw any of Josephus's writings besides, and

far from being certain that he saw even those. He had

particular occasion in his dispute against the Jews to quote

Josephus, above any other writer, to prove the completion

of the prophecies of the Old Testament in the destruction

of Jerusalem, and miseries of the Jews at that time, of which

he there discourses, yet does he never once quote him upon

that solemn occasion; so that it seems to me, that Tertullian

never read either the Greek Antiquities of Josephus, or his

Greek books of the Jewish wars ; nor is this at all strange

in Tertullian, a Latin writer, that lived in Africa, by none

of which African writers is there any one clause, that I

know of, cited out of any of Josephus's writings: nor is it

worth my while, in such numbers of positive citations of these

clauses, to mention the silence of other later writers, as being

rere of very small consequence.
