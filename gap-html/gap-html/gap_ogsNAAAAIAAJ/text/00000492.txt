436 DISSERTATION I.

and ascended into heaven, as the prophecies did foretell was

to happen. Since there neither now is, nor probably in the

days of Justin was any other Jewish testimony extant, which

is so agreeable to what Justin here affirms of those Jews, as

is this of Josephus the Jew before us; nor indeed does he

seem to me to have had any thing else particularly in his

view here, but this very testimony, where Josephus says, that

Jesus appeared to his followers alive the third day after his

crucifixion, as the divine prophets had foretold these, and ten

thousand other wonderful things concerning him.

VIII. The third author I have quoted for Joscphus's testi­

monies of John the Baptist, of Jesus of Nazareth, and of

James the Just, is Origen, who is indeed allowed on all hands

to have quoted him for the excellent characters of John the

Baptist, and of James the Just, but whose supposed entire

silence about this testimony concerning Christ is usually

alleged as the principal argument against its being genuine,

and particularly as to the clause, This was the Christ, and

that, as we have seen, because he twice assures us, that, in

his opinion Josephus did not himself acknowledge Jesus for

Christ. Now as to this latter clause, I have already showed,

that Josephus did not here, in writing to the Greeks and

Romans, mean any such thing by those words as Jews and

Christians naturally understand by them: I have also ob­

served, that all the ancients allow still, with Origen, that

Josephus did not, in the Jewish and Christian sense, acknow­

ledge Jesus for the true Messiah, or the true Christ of God,

notwithstanding their express quotation of that clause in

Josephus as genuine: so that unless we suppose Origen to

have had a different notion of these words from all the other

ancients, we cannot conclude from this assertion of Origen's,

that he had not those words in his copy, not to say that it is,

after all, much more likely that his copy a little differed from

the other copies in this clause, or indeed, omitted it entirely,

than that he, on its account, must be supposed not to have

had the rest of this testimony therein, though indeed I see

no necessity of making any such supposal at all. However,

it seems to me, that Origen affords us four several indications
