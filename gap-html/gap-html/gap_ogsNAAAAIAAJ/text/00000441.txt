same notions of the nature of God; yet durst not these men

disclose those true notions to more than a few, because the

body of the people were prejudiced with other opinions be足

forehand. But our legislator, who made his actions agree to

his laws, did not only prevail with these that were his con足

temporaries to agree with these his notions, but so firmly im足

printed this faith in God upon all their posterity, that it

never could be removed. The reason why the constitution

of this legislation was ever better directed to the utility of

all, than other legislations were, is this, that Moses did not

make religion a part of virtue, but he saw and he ordained

other virtues to be parts of religion; I mean justice, and

fortitude, and temperance, and a universal agreement of the

members of the community with one another: for all our

actions and studies, and all our words [in Moses's settlement,]

the Cretians teach by practical exercises, but not by words;

while the Athenians and almost all the other Grecians made

laws about what was to be done, or left undone, but had no

regard to the exercising them thereto in practice.

two methods of instruction together ; for he neither left these

practical exercises to go on without verbal instruction, nor

did he permit the hearing of the law to proceed without the

exercises for practice; but beginning immediately from the

earliest infancy, and the appointment of every one's diet,

he left nothing of the very smallest consequence to be done

at the pleasure and disposal of the person himself: accord足

ingly, he made a fixed rule of law, what sorts of food they

should abstain from, and what sorts they should make use

of, as also what communion they should have with others;
