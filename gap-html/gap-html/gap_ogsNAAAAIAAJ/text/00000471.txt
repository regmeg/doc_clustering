DISSERTATION I.

THE TESTIMONIES OP JOSEPHUS CONCERNING JESUS CHRIST,

JOHN THE BAPTIST, AND JAMES THE JUST, VINDICATED.

Since we meet with several important testimonies in Jose-

phus, the Jewish historian, concerning John the Baptist, the

forerunner of Jesus of Nazareth, concerning Jesus of Naza­

reth himself, and concerning James the Just, the brother of

Jesus of Nazareth ; and since the principal testimony, which

is that concerning Jesus of Nazareth himself, has of late been

greatly questioned by many, and rejected by some of the

learned as spurious, it will be fit for me, who have ever de­

clared my firm belief that these testimonies were genuine, to

set down fairly some of the original evidence and citations I

have met with in the first fifteen centuries concerning them,

and then to make proper observations upon that evidence, for

the reader's more complete satisfaction.

But before I produce the citations themselves out of Jose-

phus, give me leave to prepare the reader's attention, by set­

ting down the sentiments of perhaps the most learned person,

and the most competent judge that ever was, as to the au­

thority of Josephus: I mean of Joseph Scaliger in the Prole­

gomena to his book, De JZmendatione Temporum, p. 17.

"Josephus is the most diligent and the greatest lover of

truth of all writers; nor are we afraid to affirm of him, that

it is more safe to believe him, not only as to the affairs of the

Jews, but also as to those that are foreign to them, than all

the Greek and Latin writers; and this, because his fidelity

and his compass of learning are every where conspicuous."
