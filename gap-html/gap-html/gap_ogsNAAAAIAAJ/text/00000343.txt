and by the tears that were in their eyes declared their dissent

from his opinion. When Eleazar saw these people in such

fear, and that their souls were dejected at so prodigious a

proposal, he was afraid lest, perhaps, these effeminate persons

should by their lamentations and tears enfeeble those that

heard what he had said courageously; so he did not leave off

exhorting them, but stirred up himself; and recollecting

proper arguments for raising their courage, ho undertook to

speak more briskly and fully to them, and that concerning

is invisible, it makes the body a sensible instrument, and

causes it to advance farther in its actions than moral nature
