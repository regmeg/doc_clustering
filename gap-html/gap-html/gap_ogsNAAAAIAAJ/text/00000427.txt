B. II.] AGAINST APION. 421

8. He adds another Grecian fable, in order to reproach us.

In reply to which it would be enough to say, that they who

presume to speak about divine worship, ought not to be igno­

rant of this plain truth, that it is a degree of less impurity to

pass through temples than to forge wicked calumnies of its

priests. Now such men as he are more zealous to justify a

sacrilegious king than to write what is just and what is true

about us, and about our temple : for when they are desirous

of gratifying Antiochus, and of concealing that perfidiousness

and sacrilege which he was guilty of with regard to our na­

was fattened by these curious provisions thus set before him :

and that truly at the first such unexpected advantages seemed

to him matter of great joy: that, after a while, they brought

a suspicion upon him, and at length astonishment, what their

meaning should be : that at last he inquired of the servants

that came to him, and was by them informed, that it was in

order to the fulfilling a law of the Jews, which they must not
