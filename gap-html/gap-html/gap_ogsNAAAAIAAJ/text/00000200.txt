194 TITUS PRESSES THE SIEGE. [B. V.

the machines was very hot, while the one side tried hard to

set them on fire, and the other side to prevent it; on both

sides there was a confused cry made, and many of those in

the fore-front of the battle were slain. However, the Jews

were now too hard for the Romans, by the furious assaults

they made like madmen; and the fire caught hold of the

works, and both all those works and the engines themselves

had been in danger of being burnt, had not many of those

select soldiers that came from Alexandria opposed themselves

to prevent it, and had they not behaved themselves with

greater courage than they themselves supposed they could

have done: for they outdid those in this fight that had greater

reputation than themselves before. This was the state of

things till Caear took the stoutest of his horsemen, and at­

tacked the enemy, when he himself slew twelve of those that

were in the fore-front of the Jews; which death of these men,

when the rest of the multitude saw, they gave way, and he

pursued them, and drove them all into the city, and saved

the works from the fire. Now it happened at this fight that

a certain Jew was taken alive, who, by Titus's order, was

crucified before the wall, to see whether the rest of them

would be affrighted, and abate of their obstinacy. But after

the Jews were retired, John, who was commander of the

Idumeans, and was talking to a certain soldier of his acquaint­

ance beforo tho wall, was wounded by a dart shot at him by

an Arabian, and died immediately, leaving the greatest la­

mentation to the Jews and sorrow to the seditious: for ho

was a man of great eminence both for his actions and his

conduct also.
