B. II.] AGAINST APION. 423

for the proper way of confuting fools is not to use bare words,

but to appeal to the things themselves that make against them.

Now then, all such as ever saw the construction of our tem足

ple, of what nature it was, knew well enough how the purity

of it was never to be profaned; for it had four several courts,1

encompassed with cloisters round about, every one of which

had, by our law, a peculiar degree of separation from the

rest. Into the first court every body was allowed to go, even

foreigners, and none but women, during their courses, were

prohibited to pass through it; all the Jews went into the se足

cond court, as well as their wives, when they were free from

all uncleanness; into the third court went in the Jewish men,

when they were clean and purified; into the fourth went the

priests, having on their sacerdotal garments ; but for the most

sacred place, none went in but the high-priests, clothed in

their peculiar garments. Now there is so great caution used

about these offices of religion, that the priests are .appointed

to go into the temple but at certain hours; for in the morn足

ing, at the opening of the inner temple, those that are to

officiate receive the sacrifices, as they do again at noon, till

the doors are shut. Lastly, it is not so much as lawful to

carry any vessel into the holy house; nor is there any thing

therein but the altar [of incense,] the table [of show-bread,]

the censer, and the candlestick, which are all written in the

law; for there is nothing farther there, nor are there any

mysteries performed that may not be spoken of; nor is there

any feasting within the place. For what I have now said is

publicly known, and supported by the testimony of the whole

people, and their operations are very manifest; for although

there be four courses of the priests, and every one of them

have above five thousand men in them, yet do they officiate

on certain days only ; and when those "days are over, other

1 It is remarkable that Joscphus here, and, I think, nowhere else, reckons

up four distinct courts of the temple; that of the Gentiles, that of the wo足

men of Israel, that of the men of Israel, and that of the priests; as also,

that the court of the women admitted of tho men (I suppose only of the

husbands of those wives that were therein,) while the court of the men did

not admit any women into it at all.
