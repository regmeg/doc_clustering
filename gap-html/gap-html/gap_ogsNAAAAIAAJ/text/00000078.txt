CHAPTER I.

THE SIEGE AND TAKING OF GAMALA.

ยง 1. Now all those Galileans who, after the taking of Jota-

pata, had revolted from the Romans, did, upon the conquest

of Taricheae, deliver themselves up to them again. And the

Romans received all the fortresses and the cities, excepting

Gischala and those that had seized upon Mount Tabor; Ga-

mala also, which is a city over against Taricheae, but on the

other side of the lake, conspired with them. This city lay

upon the borders of Agrippa's kingdom, as also did Sogana

and Seleucia. And these were both parts of Gaulanitis; for

Sogana was a part of that called the Upper Gaulanitis ; as

was Gamala of the Lower; while Seleucia was situated at the

lake Semechonitis, which lake is thirty furlongs in breadth

and sixty in length; its marshes reach as far as the place

Daphne, which, in other respects is a delicious place, and

hath such fountains as supply water to what is called Little

Jordan, under the temple of the golden calf,1 where it is sent

1 Here we have the exact situation of one of Jeroboam's golden calves, at

the exit of Little Jordan into Great Jordan, near a place called Daphne, but

of old Pan. See the note on Antiq. B. viii. ch. Tiii. sect 4. But Reland

suspects that even here we should read Dan instead of Daphne, there being

no where else any mention of a place called Daphne hereabouts.
