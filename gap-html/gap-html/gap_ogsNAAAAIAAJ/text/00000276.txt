270 THE TEMPLE IS BURNED. [B \u

quench the fire; and gave order to Liberalius, the centurion,

and one of those spearmen that were about him, to beat the

soldiers that were refractory with their staves, and to restrain

them: yet were their passions too hard for the regards they

had for Caesar, and the dread they had of him who forbade

them, as was their hatred of the Jews, and a certain vehement

inclination to fight them, too hard for them also. Moreover,

the hope of plunder induced many to go on, as having this

opinion, that all the places within were full of money, and as

seeing that all around about it was made of gold. And, be­

sides, one of those that went into the place prevented Caesar,

when he ran so hastily out to restrain the soldiers, and threw

the fire upon the hinges of the gate, in the dark; whereby

the flame burst out from within the holy house itself immedi­

ately, when the commanders retired and Cnesar with them,

and when nobody any longer forbade those that were without

to set fire to it. And thus was the holy house burnt down

without Caesar's approbation.

8. Now, although any one would justly lament the destruc­

tion of such a work as this was, since it was the most ad­

mirable of all the works that we have seen or heard, both for

its curious structure and its magnitude, and also for the vast

wealth bestowed upon it, as well as for the glorious reputa­

tion it had for its holiness; yet might such a one comfort

himself with this thought, that it was fate that decreed it so

to be, which is inevitable, both as to living creatures and as

to works and places also. However, one cannot but wonder

at the accuraoy of this period thereto relating; for the same

month and day were now observed, as I said before, wherein

the holy house was burnt formerly by the Babylonians. Now

the number of years that passed from its first foundation,

which was laid by king Solomon, till this its destruction,

which happened in the second year of the reign of Vespasian,

are collected to be one thousand one hundred and thirty,

besides seven months and fifteen days; and from the second

building of it, which was done by Haggai, in the second year

of Cyrus the king, till its destruction under Vespasian, there

were six hundred thirty-nine years and forty-five days.
