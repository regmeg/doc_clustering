C. VIII.] MASADA AND THE SICARII. 82&

regard to God might be preserved: they thence proceeded to

destroy utterly the least remains of a political government,

and introduced the most complete scene of iniquity in all

instances that were practicable, under which scene, that sort

of people that were called zealots grew up, and who, indeed,

corresponded to the name; for they imitated every wicked

work ; nor, if their memory suggested any evil thing that had

formerly been done, did they avoid zealously to pursue the

fortress Masada together with him ; and for the whole

country adjoining, he presently gained it, and put garrisons

into the most proper places of it: he also built a wall <juite

round the entire fortress, that none of the besieged might

easily escape: he also set his men to guard the several parts

of it: he also pitched his camp in such an agreeble place as

he had chosen for the siege, and at which place the rock

belonging to the fortress did make the nearest approach to

the neighboring mountain, which yet was a place of difficulty

for getting plenty of provisions : for it was not only food that

was to be brought from a great distance [to the army,] and

this with a great deal of pain to those Jews who were
