458 JOSEPflUS'S DISCOURSE ABOUT HADES.

all men from the dead; not procuring a transmigration of

souls from one body to another, but raising again those very

bodies which you Greeks, seeing to be dissolved, do not

believe [their resurrection.] But learn not to disbelieve it;

for while you believe that the soul is created, and yet is made

immortal by God, according to the doctrine of Plato, and

this in time, be not incredulous; but believe that God is able>

when he hath raised to life that body which was made as a

compound of the same elements, to make it immortal; for it

must never be said of God, that he is able to do some things

and unable to do others. We have, therefore, believed that

the body will be raised again; for although it be dissolved,

it is not perished; for the earth receives its remains, and

preserves them; and while they are like seed, and are mixed

among the more fruitful soil, they flourish ; and what is sown

is, indeed, sown bare grain, but at the mighty sound of God,

the Creator, it will sprout up, and be raised in a clothed and

glorious condition, though not before it has been dissolved

and mixed [with the earth.] So that we have not rashly

believed the resurrection of the body; for although it be

dissolved for a time on account of the original transgression,

it exists still, and is cast into the earth as into a potter's

furnace, in order to be formed again, not in order to rise

again such as it was before, but in a state of purity, and so

as never to be destroyed any more. And to every body

shall its own soul be restored. And when it hath clothed

itself with that body, it will not be subject to misery; but

being itself pure, it will continue with its pure body, and

rejoice with it; with which it having walked righteously

now in this world, and never having had it as a snare, it will

receive it again with great gladness. But as for the unjust,

they will receive their bodies not changed, not freed from

diseases or distempers, nor made glorious, but with the same

diseases wherein they died; and such as they were in their

unbelief, the same shall they be when they shall be faithÂ­

fully judged.
