B. I.] AGAINST APION. 401

us: for he forbade those that had the leprosy either to con­

tinue in a city, or to inhabit in a village, but commanded that

they should go about by themselves with their clothes rent;

and declares that such as either touch them, or live under

the same roof with them, should be esteemed unclean; nay

more, if any one of their disease be healed, and he recover

his natural constitution again, he appointed them certain

purifications, and washings with spring-water, and the shaving

off all their hair; and enjoins that they shall offer many sa­

crifices, and those of several kinds, and then at length to be

admitted into the holy city; although it were to be expected

that, on the contrary, if he had been under the same cala­

and have had them treated after a kinder manner, as affected

with a concern for those that were to be under the like mis­

fortunes with himself. Nor was it only those leprous people

for whose sake he made these laws, but also for such as should

be maimed in the smallest part of their body, who yet are not

permitted by him to officiate as priests: nay, although any

priest already initiated, should have such a calamity fall upon

him afterward, he ordered him to be deprived of his honor

of officiating. How can it, then, be supposed that Moses

should ordain such laws against himself, to his own reproach

and damage who so ordained them ? Nor, indeed, is that

other notion of Manctho's at all probable, wherein he relates

the change of his name, and says, that "he was formerly

called Osarsiph:" and this a name no way agreeable to the

other, while his true name was Mouses, and signifies a person

who is preserved out of the water; for the Egyptians call

water Moil. I think, therefore, I have made it sufficiently

evident that Manetho, while he followed his ancient records,

did not much mistake the truth of the history; but that when

he had recourse to fabulous stories, without any certain au­

thor, he either forged them himself, without any probability,

or else gave credit to some men who spake so out of their ill-

will to us.

into what Cheremon says : for he also, when he pretended to
