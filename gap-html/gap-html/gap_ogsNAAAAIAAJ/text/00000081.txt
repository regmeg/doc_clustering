and brake in by force upon those that were in the city; but

these men fell upon the Romans for some time at their first

entrance, and prevented their going any farther, and with

great courage beat them back; and the Romans were so

overpowered by the greater multitude of the people, who beat

them on every side, that they were obliged to run into upper

parts of the city. Whereupon the people turned about and

fell upon their enemies, who had attacked them, and thrust

them down to the lower parts, and as they were distressed by

the narrowness and difficulty of the place, slew them; and as

these Romans could neither beat those back that were above

them, nor escape the force of their own men that were forcing

their way forward, they were compelled to fly into their

enemies' houses, which were low; but these houses, being thus

full of soldiers, whose weight they could not bear, fell down

suddenly; and when one house fell it shook down a great

many of those that were under it, as did those do to such as

were under them. By this means a vast number of the Ro­

mans perished, for they were so terribly distressed, that al­

though they saw the houses subsiding, they were compelled

to leap upon the tops of them; so that a great many were

ground to powder by these ruins, and a great many of those

that got from under them lost some of their limbs, but still a

greater number were suffocated by the dust that arose from

those ruins. The people of Gamala supposed this to be an

assistance afforded them by God, and without regarding what

damage they suffered themselves, they pressed forward, and

thrust the enemy upon the tops of their houses; and when

they stumbled in the sharp and narrow streets, and were

perpetually falling down, they threw their stones or darts at

them and slew them. Now, the very ruins afforded them

stones enough, and for iron weapons the dead men of the

enemies' side afforded them what they wanted; for, drawing

the swords of those that were dead, they mado use of them

to dispatch such as were only half dead; nay there were a

great number who, upon their falling down from the tops of

houses, stabbed themselves and died after that manner; nor,

indeed, was it easy for those that were beaten back to fly
