them as occasion should require, and would easily reduce the

country under their dominion. These shepherds were all

very glad of this message, and came away with alacrity

altogether, being in number two hundred thousand men;

and in a little time they came to Avaris. And now Ameno-

phis, the king of Egypt, upon his being informed of their

invasion, was in great confusion, as calling to mind what

Amenophis, the son of Papis, had foretold him; and, in the

Ethiopia. But for the people of Jerusalem, when they came

down together with the polluted Egyptians, they treated the

men in such a barbarous manner, that those who saw how

they subdued the forementioned country, and the horrid

wickedness they were guilty of, thought it a most dreadful

thing; for they did not only set the cities and villages on fire,
