C.X.] INCLINATIONS OF THE PEOPLE. 213

am sensible that this danger will extend to my mother and

wife, and to that family of mine which hath been by no means

ignoble, and, indeed, to one that hath been very eminent in

so ready to desert were these, that now they should be freed

from those miseries which they had endured in that city, and

these men's going out, than they did the coming in of the

Romans; and if any one did but afford the least shadow of

suspicion of such an intention, his throat was cut immediately.

2. But as for the richer sort, it proved all one to them

whether they stayed in the city or attempted to get out of it;
