B. II.] AGAINST APION. 453

bad laws notwithstanding, what penalties then do they deserve

to undergo who do not observe their own laws, which they

esteem so far superior to them ? Whereas, therefore, length

of time is esteemed to be the truest touchstone in all cases, I

would make that a testimonial of the excellency of our laws,

and of that belief thereby delivered to us concerning God:

for as there hath been a very long time for this comparison,

if any one will but compare its duration with the duration of

the laws made by other legislators, he will find our legislators

to have been the ancientest of them all.

country and his own family, he will have reason to give credit

to what I say. It is, therefore, but just, either to condemn

all mankind of indulging a wicked disposition, when they

have been so desirous of imitating laws that are to them

foreign and evil in themselves, rather than following laws of

their own that are of a better character, or else our accusers
