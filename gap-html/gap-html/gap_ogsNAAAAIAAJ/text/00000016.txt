were bidden upon the least intimation. So they were easily

beaten; for as soon as ever their first ranks were once in dis­

order, they were put to flight by the enemy's cavalry; and

those of them that came behind such as crowded to the wall

fell upon their own party's weapons, and became one another's

enemies, and this so long till they all were forced to give way

to the attacks of the horsemen, and were dispersed all over

the plain; which plain was wide, and all fit for the horse­

mans, and occasioned the slaughter of the greatest number

of the Jews; for such as ran away they could overrun them

and make them turn back; and when they had brought them

zealously under their misfortunes, out of the shame of a sudden

flight, and hopes of the change in their success, so did the

men of the Jews' side lay dead, with two of their generals,

John and Silas, and the greater part of the remainder were

wounded, with Niger, their remaining general, who fled away

together to a small city of Idumea called Sallis: some few

also of the Romaus were wounded in this battle.

3. Yet were not the spirits of the Jews broken by so great

a calamity, but the losses they had sustained rather quickened

their resolution for other attempts; for, overlooking the dead

bodies which lay under their feet, they were enticed by their

former glorious actions to venture on a second destruction;

so when they had lain still so little a while that their wounds

were not yet thoroughly cured, they got together all their

forces, and came with greater fury, and in much greater
