to call in the Idumeans; so they wrote a bhfrrt" letter to this

effect, that "Ananus had imposed on the people,, and was

betraying their metropolis to the Romans; that they themÂ­

selves had revolted from the rest, and were in custody in the

temple, on account of the preservation of their liberty: .that
