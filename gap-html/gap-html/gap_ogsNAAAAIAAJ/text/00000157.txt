CXI.] AFFAIRS AT ROME. 151

vince, and made haste, in order to fight Vitellius ; whereupon

Vitellius sent away Cecinna, with a great army, having a

mighty confidence in him, because of his having beaten Otho.

This Cecinna marched out of Rome in great haste, and found

Antonius about Cremona in Gall, which city is in the borders

of Italy; but when he saw there that the enemy were numer­

ous and in good order, he durst not fight them, and as he

thought a retreat dangerous, so he began to think of betray­

ing his army to Antonius. Accordingly, he assembled the

centurions and tribunes that were under his command, and

persuaded them to go over to Antonius, and this by dimin­

ishing the reputation of Vitellius, and by exaggerating the

power of Vespasian. He also told them that " with the one

there was no more than the bare name of dominion, but with

the other was the power of it. And that it were better for

them to prevent necessity and gain favor, and, while they

were likely to be overcome in battle, to avoid the danger be­

without their assistance, while Vitellius could not preserve

what he had already with it."

drawing their swords, they assaulted Cecinna in order to kill

him ; and the thing had been done by them, if the tribunes

had not fallen upon their knees, and besought them not to do

it: so the soldiers did not kill him, but put him in bonds as

a traitor, and were about to send him to Vitellius. When

[Antonius] Primus heard of this, he raised up his men imme­

diately, and made them put on their armor, and led them

against those that had revolted; hereupon they put them­

selves in order of battle, and made a resistance for a while,

but were soon beaten, and fled to Cremona: then did Primus

take his horsemen, and cut off their entrance into the city,

and encompassed and destroyed a great multitude of them
