themselves from the beginning to have such bad notions con­

cerning their gods, and could not think of imitating that de­

cent form of divine worship which we made use of, though,

when they saw our institutions approved of by many others,

they could not but envy us on that account; for some of them

have proceeded to that degree of folly and meanness in their

conduct, as not to scruple to contradict their own ancient re­

cords ; nay, to contradict themselves also in their writings,

and yet were so blinded by their passions as not to discern it.

26. And now I will turn my discourse to one of their

principal writers, whom I have a little before made use of as

a witness to our antiquity; I mean Manctho.1 He promised

to interpret the Egyptian history out of their sacred writings,

and premised this — that "our people had come into Egypt

many ten thousands in number, and subdued its inhabitants ;"

and when he had farther confessed, that " we went out of

that country afterward, and settled in that country which is

now called Judea, and there built Jerusalem and its temple."

Now thus far he followed his ancient records; but after this

he permits himself, in order to appear to have written what

rumors and reports passed abroad about the Jews, and intro­

duces incredible narrations, as if he would have the Egyptian

multitude that had the leprosy and other distempers to have

been mixed with us, as he says they were; and that they

were condemned to fly out of Egypt together ; for he mentions

Amenophis, a fictitious king's name, though on that account

he durst not set down the number of years of his reign,

which yet he had accurately done as to the other kings he

of the next, one may easily perceive that our usually cool and candid author,

Josephus, was too highly oft-ended with the impudent calumnies of Manctho,

and the other bitter enemies of the Jews, with whom he had now to deal,

and was thereby betrayed into a greater heat and passion than ordinary,

and that by consequence he does not here reason with his usual fairness and

impartiality: he seems to depart sometimes from the brevity and sincerity

of a faithful historian, which is his grand character, and indulges the pro­

lixity and colors of n pleader and a disputant: accordingly, I confess I
always

read these sections with less pleasure than I do the rest of his writings,

though I fully believe the reproaches oast on the Jews, which he here

endeavors to confute and expose, wore wholly groundless and unreasonable.
