DISSERTATION III. 533

TRAJAN'S EPISTLE TO PLINY.

My Pliny—You have taken the method which you ought,

in examining the causes of those that had been accused as

Christians; for, indeed, no certain and general form of judg­

sent without an author, they ought to have no place in any

accusation whatsoever, for that would be a thing of very ill

example, and not agreeable to my reign.

names any of those Roman authors whence he derives other

parts of his history, yet does it appear that he refers to his

seven books of the Jewish Wars several times in a very few

pages, and almost always depends on his accounts of the

affairs of the Romans and Parthian?, as well as of the Jews,

thians, or the Jews, during that long interval, he was com­

monly mistaken in them, and had better have kept close to

Josephus, than hearken to any of his other authors or in­

formers.

III. It also appears highly probable that Tacitus had seen
