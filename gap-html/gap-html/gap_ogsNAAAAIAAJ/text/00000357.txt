heavy upon him than the other: for he was terribly disturbed,

and continually cried out,—" That he saw the ghosts of those

men whom he had slain standing before him." Whereupon

he was not able to contain himself, but leaped out of his bed,

as if both torments and fire were brought to him. This his

distemper grew still a great deal worse and worse continually;

and his very entrails were so corroded, that they fell out of

his body, and in that condition he died. Thus he became as

great an instance of divine providence as ever was, and de­

monstrated that God punishes wicked men.

wherein we formerly promised to deliver the same, with all

accuracy, to such as should be desirous of understanding

after what manner this war of the Romans with the Jews

was managed. Of which history how good the style is must

be left to the determination of the readers: but as for its

agreement with the facts, I shall not scruple to say, and that

boldly, that truth hath been what I have alone aimed at

through its entire composition.
