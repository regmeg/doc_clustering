mans, when they had taken such great pains about weaker

walls, get by good fortune what they could never have gotten

by their engines ; for three of these towers were too strong

for all mechanical engines whatsoever, concerning which we

have treated above.

they were ejected out of them by God himself, and fled im­

mediately to that valley which was under Siloam, where they

again recovered themselves out of the dread they were in for

a while, and ran violently against that part of the Roman

wall which lay on that side; but as their courage was too

much depressed to make their attacks with suflicient force,

and their power was now broken with fear and affliction, they

were repulsed by the guards, and, dispersing themselves at

distances from each other, went down into the subterranean

caverns. So the Romans being now become masters of the

walls, they both placed their ensigns upon the towers, and

made joyful acclamations for the victory they had gained, as

having found the end of this war much lighter than its be­

ginning: for when they had gotten upon the last wall, with­

out any bloodshed, they could hardly believe what they found

to be true; but seeing nobody to oppose them, they stood in

doubt what such an unusual solitude could mean. But when

they went in numbers into the lanes of the city, with their

swords drawn, they slew those whom they overtook without

mercy, and set fire to the houses whither the Jews were fled,

and burnt every soul in them, and laid waste a great many

of the rest; and when they were come to the houses to plun­

der them, they found in them entire families of dead men,

and the tipper rooms full of putrid corpses, that is, of such a3

died by the famine; they then stood in horror at this sight,

and went out without touching any thing. But although they

had this commiseration, for such as were destroyed in that

manner, yet had they not the same for those that wore still

alive, but they ran every one through whom they met with,

and obstructed the very lanes with their dead bodies, and

made the whole city run down with blood, to such a degree,

indeed, that the fire of many of the houses was quenched
