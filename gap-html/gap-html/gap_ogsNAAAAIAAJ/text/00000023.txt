offices of life, but might also be of advantage to them in their

wars. And, indeed, if any one does but attend to the other

parts of their military discipline, he will he forced to confess

that their obtaining so large a dominion hath been the acqui足

sition of their valor, and not the bare gift of fortune: for they

do not begin to use their weapons first in time of war, nor do

they then put their hands first into motion, while they avoided

so to do in times of peace: but as if their weapons did always

cling to them, they have never any truce from warlike exer足

cises ; nor do they stay till times of war admonish them to

use them; for their military exercises differ not at all from

the real use of their arms, but every soldier is every day exer足

cised, and that with great diligence, as if it were in time of

war, which is the reason why they bear the fatigues of battles

so easily; for neither can any disorder remove them from

their usual regularity, nor can fear affright them out of it, nor

can labor tire them: which firmness of conduct makes them

always to overcome those that have not the same firmness;

nor would he be mistaken that should call those their exercises

unbloody battles, and their battles bloody exercises. Nor can

their enemies easily surprise them with the suddenness of their

incursions ; for as soon as they have marched into an enemy's

land, they do not begin to fight till they have walled their

camp about; nor is the fence they raise rashly made or un足

even ; nor do they all abide in it, nor do those that are in it

take their places at random, but if it happens that the ground

is uneven, it is first levelled: their camp is also four square

by measure, and carpenters are ready in great numbers, with

their toob, to erect the buildings for them.1

1 This description of the exact symmetry and regularity of the Roman army

and of the Koman encampments, with the sounding their trumpets, &c, and

order of war, described in this and the next chapter, is so very like to the

symmetry and regularity of the people of Israel in the wilderness (see the

description of the temples, ch. ix.,) that one cannot well avoid the supposal

that the one was the ultimate pattern of the other, and that the tacties of
the

ancients were taken from the rules given by God to Moses. And it is thought

by some skilful in these matters, that these accounts of Josephus as to the

Roman camp and armor, and conduct in war, are preferable to those in the

Roman authors themselves.
