JOSEPHUS'S DISCOUESE ABOUT HADES. 461

to an ill catastrophe. Whosoever shall have lived wickedly

and luxuriously may repent: however, there will be need of

much time to conquer an evil habit; and even after repentÂ­

ance, his whole life must be guarded with great care and

diligence, after the manner of a body, which, after it hath

been a long time afflicted with a distemper, requires a stricter

diet and method of living: for though it may be possible,

perhaps, to break off the chain of our irregular affections at

once, yet our amendment cannot be secured without the grace

of God, the prayers of good men, the help of the brethren,

and our own sincere repentance and constant caro. It is a

good thing not to sin at all; it is also good, havmg sinned,

to repent, as it is best to have health always; but it is a good

thing to recover from a distemper. To God be glory and

dominion for ever and ever, Amen.
