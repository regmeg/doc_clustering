510 DISSERTATION III.

tbat Tacitus had some part of his information these ways,

and particularly where he a little differs from or makes addi足

tions to Josephus: but then, as this will all reach no farther

than three or four years during this war, so will it by no

means account for that abridgement of the geography of the

country, and entire series of the principal facts of history

thereto relating, which are in Tacitus, from the days of

Antiochus Epiphanes, 240 years before that war, with which

Antiochus both Josephus and Tacitus begin their distinct

histories of the Jews, preparatory to the history of this last

war. Nor could Tacitus take the greatest part of those

earlier facts belonging to the Jewish nation from the days

of Moses, or to Christ and the Christians in the days of Tibe足

rius, from Roman authors; of which Jewish and Christian

affairs those authors had usually very little knowledge, and

which the heathen generally did grossly pervert and shame足

fully falsify: and this is so true as to Tacitus's own accounts

of the origin of the Jewish nation, that the reader may almost

take it for a constant rule, that when Tacitus contradicts

Josephus's Jewish Antiquities, he cither tells direct falsehoods,

or truths so miserably disguised, as renders them little better

than falsehoods, and hardly ever lights upon any thing re足

lating to them that is true and solid, but when tho same is in

those Antiquities at this day; of which matters more will be

said in the notes on this history immediately following.

HISTORY OF THE JEWS.

BOOK V. CHAP. H.

Since we are now going to relate the final period of this

famous city [Jerusalem], it seems proper to give an account

of its original.1 The tradition is, that the Jews ran away

from the island of Crete, and settled themselves on the coast

1 Most of these stories are so entirely groundless, nnd so contradictory to

one another, that they do not deserve a serious confutation. It is strange

Tacitus could persuade himself thus crudely to set them down.
