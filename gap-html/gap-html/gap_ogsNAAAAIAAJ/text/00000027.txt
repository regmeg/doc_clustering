ranks, so sudden are their turnings about, so sharp their

hearing as to what orders are given them, so quick their

sight of the ensigns, and so nimble are their hands when

they have been conquered in battle, when they came to a

close fight, either by the multitude of the enemies, or by

their stratagems, or by the difficulties in the places they

on the cast, the ocean on the west, the most fertile regions

of Libya on the south, and the Danube and Rhine on the

north, are the limits of this empire ? One might well say,

that the Roman possessions are not inferior to the Romans

themselves.

of it, and yet have a mind to know it. I return now from

this digression.

slain a number of those whom he had caught (which were

only the weaker part of the Galileans, and such as were of
