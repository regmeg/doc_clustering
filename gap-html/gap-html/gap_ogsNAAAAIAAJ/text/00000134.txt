128 VESPASIAN HASTES [B. IV

CHAPTER VIII.

HOW VESPASIAN, UPON HEARING OF SOME COMMOTIONS IN

GALL,1 MADE HASTE TO FINISH THE JEWISH WAR : A DE­

SCRIPTION OF JERICHO AND OF THE GREAT PLAIN ; WITH AN

ACCOUNT BESIDES OF THE LAKE ASPnALTITIS.

§ 1. In the mean time an account came that there were

commotions in Gall, and that Vinilex, together with the men

of power in that country, had revolted from Nero: which

affair is more accurately described elsewhere. This report,

thus related to Vespasian, excited him to go on briskly with

the war ; for he foresaw already the civil wars which were

coming upon them, nay, that the very government was in

danger ; and he thought, if he could first reduce the eastern

parts of the empire to peace, he should make the fears for

Italy the lighter: while, therefore, the winter was his hin­

drance [from going into the field,] he put garrisons into the

villages and smaller cities for their security: he put decurions

also into the villages, and centurions into the cities : he, be­

sides this, rebuilt many of the cities that had been laid waste;

but at the beginning of the spring he took the greatest part

of his army, and led it from Coesarea to Antipatris, where he

spent two days in settling the affairs of that city, and then,

on the third day, he marched on, laying waste and burning

all the neighboring villages. And when he had laid waste

all the places about the toparchy of Thamnas, he passed on

to Lydda and Jamnia ; and when both those cities had come

over to him, be placed a great many of those that had come

over to him [from other places] as inhabitants therein, and

then came to Ernmaus, where he seized upon the passages

which led thence to their metropolis, and fortified his camp,

and, leaving the fifth legion therein, he came to the toparchy

of Bethletephon. He then destroyed that place and the

neighboring places by fire, and fortified at proper places the
