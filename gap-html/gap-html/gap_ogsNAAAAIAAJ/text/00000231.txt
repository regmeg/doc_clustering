C. XII.] TITUS WALLS UP THE CITY. 225

only part tho whole wall that was to be built among them,

nor did only one legion strive with another, but the lesser

divisions of the army did the same; insomuch that each sol足

dier was ambitious to please his decurion, each decurion his

centurion, each centurion his tribune, and the ambition of

the tribunes was to please their superior commanders; while

Caesar himself took notice of and rewarded the like conten足

tion in those commanders ; for he went round about the works

many times every day, and took a view of what was done.

Titus began the wall from the camp of the Assyrians, where

his own camp was pitched, and drew it down to the lower

parts of Cenopolis ; thence it went along the valley of Cedron

to the Mount of Olives; it then bent towards the south, and

encompassed the mountain as far as the rock called Periste-

rion, and that other hill which lies next it, and is over the

valley which reaches to Siloam; whence it bended again to

the west, and went down to the valley of the fountain, be足

yond which it went up again at the monument of Ananus the

high-priest, and encompassing that mountain where Pompey

had formerly pitched his camp, it returned back to tho north

side of the city, and was carried on as far as a certain village

called the House of the Erebinthi: after which it encompassed

Herod's monument, and there, on the cast, was joined to

Titus's own camp, where it began. Now, the length of this

wall was forty furlongs, one only abated. Now, at this wall

without were erected thirteen places to keep garrison in,

whose circumferences put together amounted to ten furlongs ;

the whole was completed in three days: so that what would

naturally have required some months was done in so short an

interval as is incredible. When Titus had, therefore, encom足

passed the city with this wall, and put garrisons into proper

places, he went round the wall at the first watch of the night,

and observed how the guard was kept; the second watch he

allotted to Alexander; the commanders of legions took the

third watch. They also cast lots among themselves who should

be upon the watch in the night-time, and who should go all

night long round the spaces that were interposed between the

garrisons.
