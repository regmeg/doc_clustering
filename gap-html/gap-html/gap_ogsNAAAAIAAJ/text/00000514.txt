DISSERTATION III.

TACITUS'S ACCOUNTS OF THE ORIGIN OF THE JEWISH NATION,

AND OF THE PARTICULARS OF THE LAST JEWISH WAR ; THAT

THE FORMER WAS PROBABLY WRITTEN IN OPPOSITION TO

JOSEPHUS'S ANTIQUITIES, AND THAT THE LATTER WAS FOR

CERTAIN ALMOST ALL DIRECTLY TAKEN FROM JOSEPHUS'S

HISTORY OF THE JEWISH WAR.

therefore, it is next to impossible to suppose that Tacitus

could be unacquainted with the writings of Josephus, it

cannot but be highly proper to compare their accounts of

Judea, of the Jews, and Jewish affairs, together. Nor is it

other than a very surprising paradox to me, how it has been

possible for learned men, particularly for the several learned

editors of Josephus and Tacitus, to be so very silent about

this matter as they have hitherto been, especially when not

but the likeness of the subject-matter and circumstances is

so very often so very remarkable; nay, indeed, since many

of the particular facts belonged peculiarly to the region of

Judea, and to the Jewish nation, and are such as could hardly

be taken by a foreigner from any other author than from our

Josephus, this strange silence is almost unaccountable, if not
