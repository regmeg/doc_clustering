wall, they made fresh sallies upon the Romans, and had

every day conflicts with them by parties, together with all

such contrivances as robbers make use of, and with the

plundering of all that came to hand, as also with the setting

fire to all the other works ; and this till Vespasian made hia

army leave off fighting them, and resolved to lie round the

city, and to starve them into a surrender, as supposing that

either they would be forced to petition him for mercy, by

want of provisions, or if they should have the courage to hold

out till the last, they would perish by famine; and he con­

if he gave them an interval, and then fell upon them when

they were weakened by famine; but still he gave orders that

they should guard against their coming out of the city.

and, indeed, of all other necessaries, but they wanted water,

because there was no fountain in the city, the people being

there usually satisfied with rain-water; yet it is a rare thing

in that country to have rain in summer : and at this season,

during the siege, they were in great distress for some contri­

time particularly, as if they were already in want of water

entirely; for Josephus seeing that the city abounded with

other necessaries, and that the men were of good courage, and

being desirous to protract the siege to the Romans longer than

they expected, ordered their drink to be given them by mea­

deemed by them as a thing more hard upon them than the

want of it; and their not being able to drink as much as they

would made them more desirous of drinking than they had

otherwise been ; nay, they were as much disheartened thereby

as if they were come to the last degree of thirst. Nor were

the Romans unacquainted with the state they were in; for

when they stood over against them beyond the wall, they could

see them running together, and taking their water by measure,

which made them throw their javelins thither, the place being

within their reach, and kill a great many of them.
