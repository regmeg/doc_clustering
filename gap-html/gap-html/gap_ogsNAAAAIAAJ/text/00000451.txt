B. II.] AGAINST APION. 445

thousand changes in our fortune, by the changes that hap­

pened among the kings of Asia, we have never betrayed our

laws under the most pressing distresses we have been in, nor

have we neglected them either out of sloth or for a livelihood.1

Nay, if any one will consider it, the difficulties and labors

laid upon us, have been greater than what appears to have

been borne by the Lacedemonian fortitude, while they neither

ploughed their land nor exercised any trades, but lived in

their own city, free from all such pains-taking, in the enjoy­

ment of plenty, and using such exercises as might improve

their bodies ; while they made use of other men as their ser­

vants for all the necessaries of life, and had their food pre­

pared for them by the others: and these good and humane

actions they do for no other purpose but this, that by their

actions and their sufferings they may be able to conquer all

those against whom they make war. I need not add this,

that they have not been fully able to observe their laws; for

not only a few single persons, but multitudes of them, havo

in heaps neglected those laws, and have delivered themselves

together with their arms, into the hands of their enemies.

33. Now, as for ourselves, I venture to say, that no one can

tell of so many, nay, not more than one or two, that have be­

trayed our laws; no, not out of fear of death itself: I do not

mean such an easy death as happens in battles, but that which

comes with bodily torments, and seems to be the severest kind

of death of all others. Now I think those that have con­

quered us have put us to such deaths, not out of their hatred

to us when they had subdued us, but rather out of their desire

to see a surprising sight, which is this, whether there be such

men in the world who believe that no evil is to them so great

as to be compelled to do or to speak any thing contrary to

their own laws! Nor ought men to wonder at us, if we arc

more courageous in dying for our laws than all other men

are; for other men Jo not easily submit to the easier things

in which we are instituted; I mean working with our hands

and eating but little, and being contented to eat and drink

1 Or, we have observed our times of rest and sorts of food allowed us [du­

ring those distresses]
