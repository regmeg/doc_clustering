thirty furlongs, and its breadth one hundred and twenty, and

it is divided in the midst by Jordan. It hath two lakes in it,

that of Asphaltitis and that of Tiberias, whose natures are

out of this city to this fountain, and threw into the current

an earthen vessel full of salt; after which he stretched out

his righteous hand unto heaven, and, pouring out a inild drink-
