334 ELEAZAR'S SPEECHES, [b. VII.

This work of theirs was like a real edifice; and when the ma­

chines were applied, the blows were weakened by its yielding,

and as the materials, by such concussion, were shaken closer

together, the pile by that means became firmer than before.

When Silva saw this, he thought it best to endeavor the

taking of this wall by setting fire to it; so he gave order that

the soldiers should throw a great number of burning torches

upon it: accordingly, as it was chiefly made of wood, it soon

took fire; and, when it was once set on fire, its hollowness

this to be the best thing they could do in their present cir­

cumstances, he gathered the most courageous of his compan­

ions together, and encouraged them to take that course by a

speech' which he made to them in the manner following: —

1 The speeches in this and the next section, as introduced under the person

of this Eleazar, are exceeding remarkable, and on the noblest subjects, the

contempt of death, and the dignity and immortality of the soul: and that not

only among the .Jews, but among the Indians themselves also, and are highly
