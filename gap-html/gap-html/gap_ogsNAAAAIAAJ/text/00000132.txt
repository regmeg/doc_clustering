destroyed; for as they fell upon the Romans when they were

joined close together, and, as it were, walled about with

their entire armor, they were not able to find any place

where the darts could enter; nor were they any way able to

break their ranks, while they were themselves run through

by the Roman darts, and like the wildest of wild beasts rushed

upon the points of the others' swords ; so some of them were

destroyed, as cut with their enemies' swords upon their faces,

and others were dispersed by the horsemen.

5. Now Placidus's concern was to exclude them in their

flight from getting into the village; and causing his horse to

march continually on that side of them, he then turned short

upon them, and at the same time his men made use of their

darts, and easily took their aim at those that were the

nearest to them, as they made those that were farther off

turn back by the terror they were in, till at last the most

courageous of them brake through those horsemen, and fled

to the wall of the village. And now those that guarded the

wall were in great doubt what to do; for they could not bear

the thoughts of excluding those that came from Gadara,

because of their own people that were among them; and yet,

if they should admit them, they expected to perish with them,

which came to pass accordingly; for as they were crowding

together at the wall, the Roman horsemen were just ready to

fall in with them. However, the guards prevented them, and

shut the gates, when Flacidus made an assault upon them,

and fighting courageously till it was dark, he got possession

of the wall and of the people that were in the city, when the

useless multitude were destroyed; but those that were more

potent ran away, and the soldiers plundered the houses, and

set the village on fire. As for those that ran out of the

village, they stirred up such as were in the country, and exÂ­

aggerating their own calamities, and telling them that the

whole army of the Romans were upon them, they put them

into great fear on every side; so they got in great numbers

together, and fled to Jericho, for they knew no other place

that could afford them any hope of escaping, it being a city

that had a strong wall and a great multitude of inhabitants.
