have advanced a certain timorousness and fear, as also mad足

ness and fraud, and any other of the vilest passions into the

nature and form of gods, and have persuaded whole cities to

offer sacrifice to the hetter sort of them ; on which account

they have been absolutely forced to esteem some gods as the

givers of good things, and to call others of them averters of

evil. They also endeavor to move them, as they would the

vilest of men, by gifts and presents, as looking for nothing

else than to receive some great mischief from them unless

they pay them such wages.

occasion of this unjust management and of these scandals

as each of them could contrive a shape [proper for a god ;]

the one to be formed out of clay, and the other by making a

bare picture of such a one. But those workmen that were

principally admired, had the use of ivory and of gold as the

constant materials for their new statutes: [whereby it comes

to pass that some temples are quite deserted, while others are

in great esteem, and adorned with all the rites of all kinds

of purification.] Besides this, the first gods, who have long

flourished in the honors done them, are now grown old [while

those that flourished after them are come in their room as a

second rank, that I may speak the most honorably of them

that I can;] nay, certain other gods there arc who are newly

introduced, and newly worshipped [as we by way of digres足

sion have said already, and yet have left their places of wor足
