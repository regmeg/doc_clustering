C. I.] THE TOWER OP ANTON IA. 289

this fall of their wall was unexpected by them, and they had

made no provision in that case, yet did they pull up their

courage, because the tower of Antonia itself was still standing;

as was the unexpected joy of the Romans at this fall of the

wall soon quenched by the sight they had of another wall,

which John and his party had built within it. However, the

attack of this second wall appeared to be easier than that of

the former, because it seemed a thing of greater facility to get

up to it through the parts of the former wall that were now

thrown down. This new wall appeared also to be much weaker

than the tower of Antonia, and, accordingly, the Romans im­

agined that it had been erected so much on the sudden, that

they should soon overthrow it: yet did not any body venture

now to go up to this wall, for that such as first ventured to do

so must certainly be killed.

5. And now Titus, upon consideration that the alacrity of

soldiers in war is chiefly excited by hopes and by good words,

and that exhortations and promises do frequently make men

to forget the hazards they run, nay, and sometimes to despise

death itself, got together the most courageous part of his army,

and tried what he could do with his men by these methods :—

" O fellow-soldiers," said he, " to make an exhortation to men

to do what hath no peril in it, is, on that very account, inglo­

rious to such to whom that exhortation is made ; and, indeed,

so it is in him that makes the exhortation an argument of his

own cowardice also. I therefore think that such exhortations

ought then only to be made use of when affairs are in a dan­

gerous condition, and yet are worthy of being attempted by

every one themselves: accordingly, I am fully of the same

opinion with you, that it is a difficult task to go up this wall;

but that it is proper for those that desire reputation for their

valor to struggle with difficulties in such cases, will then ap­

pear, when I have particularly showed that it is a brave thing

to die with glory, and that the courage here necessary shall

not go unrewarded in those that first begin the attempt. And

let my first argument to move you to it be taken from what

probably some would think reasonable to dissuade you, I mean

the constancy and patience of these Jews, even under their
