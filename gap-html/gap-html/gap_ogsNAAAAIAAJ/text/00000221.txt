C.X.] THE FAMINE. 215

were most dear were perishing under their hands, they were

not ashamed to take from them the very last drops that might

preserve their lives: and while they ate after this manner,

yet were they not concealed in so doing; but the seditious

every where came upon them immediately, and snatched away

from them what they had gotten from others; for when they

saw any houso shut up, this was to them a signal that the

people within had gotten some food; whereupon they broke

open the doors, and ran in, and took pieces of what they were

eating almost up out of their very throats, and this by force:

the old men, who held their food fast, were beaten; and if

the women hid what they had between their hands, their hair

was torn for so doing; nor was there any commiseration shown

meal that was concealed; and this was done when these tor­

mentors were not themselves hungry; for the thing had been

less barbarous had necessity forced them to it: but this

was done to keep their madness in exercise, and as making

preparation of provisions for themselves for the following

days. These men went also to meet those that had crept

out of the city by night, as far as the Roman guards, to

gather some plants and herbs that grew wild; and when those

people thought they had got clear of the enemy, theso

snatched from them what they had brought with them, even

whilo they had frequently entreated them, and that by call­

ing upon the tremendous name of God, to give them back
