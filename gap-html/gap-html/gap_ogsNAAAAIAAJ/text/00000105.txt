C. III.] THE HIGH-PBIEST ANANUS. 99

advice. So Ananus and his party believed his oath, and did

now receive him to their consultations without farther suspi­

cion ; nay, so far did they believe him, that they sent him as

their ambassador into the temple to the zealots, with proposals

of accommodation; for they were very desirous to avoid the

pollution of the temple as much as they possibly could, and

that no one of their nation should be slain therein.

14. But now this John, as if his oath had been made to the

zealots, and for confirmation of his good-will to them, and not

against them, went into the temple, and stood in the midst

of them, and spake as follows: — That " ho had run many

hazards on their accounts, and in order to let them know of

every thing that was secretly contrived against them by Ana­

nus and his party ; but that both he and they should be cast

into the most imminent danger, unless some providential as­

sistance were afforded them ; for that Ananus made no longer

delay, but had prevailed with the people to send ambassadors

to Vespasian to invite him to come presently and take the city;

and that he had appointed a fast for the next day against

them, that they might obtain admission into the temple on a

religious account, or gain it by force, and fight with them

there: that he did not see how long they could either endure

a siege, or how they could fight against so many enemies. He

added farther, that it was by the providence of God he was

himself sent as an ambassador to them for an accommodation;

for that Ananus did, therefore, offer them such proposals, that

he might come upon them when they were unarmed ; that they

ought to choose one of these two methods, either to intercede

with those that guarded them to save their lives, or to provide

some foreign assistance for themselves: that if they fostered

themselves with the hopes of pardon, in case they were sub­

dued, they had forgotten what desperate things they had done,

or could suppose, that as soon as the actors repented, those

that had suffered by them must be presently reconciled to

them ; while those that have done injuries, though they pre­

tend to repent of them, are frequently hated by the others

for that sort of repentance; and that the sufferers, when they

get the power into their hands, are usually still more severe
