118 THE POLICY [B. IV.

drawn out of the gates, and despaired of Lis preservation, he

besought them to grant him a burial; but as they had threat­

ened him beforehand not to grant him any spot of earth for

a grave, which he chiefly desired of them, so did they slay

him [without permitting him to be buried.] Now when they

were slaying him, he made this imprecation upon them, that

they might undergo both famine and pestilence in this war;

and besides all, that they might come to the mutual slaughter

of one another; all which imprecations God confirmed against

these impious men, and was what came most justly upon them,

when not long afterward they tasted of their own madness in

their mutual seditions one against another. So when this

Niger was killed, their fears of being overturned were dimin­

any one came with boldness, he was esteemed a contemner

of them; and if any one came as aiming to oblige them, he

was supposed to have some treacherous plot against them,

while the only punishment of crimes, whether they were of

the greatest or smallest sort, was death. Nor could any one

escape unless he were very inconsiderable, either on account

of the meanness of his birth or on account of his fortune.

and they urged Vespasian, as their lord and general in all

cases, to make haste, and said to him, that " the providence

of God is on our side, by setting our enemies at variance

against one another; that still the change in such cases may

be sudden, and the Jews may quickly be at one again, either

because they may be tired out with their civil miseries, or

repent them of such doings." But Vespasian replied, that

" they were greatly mistaken in what they thought fit to be
