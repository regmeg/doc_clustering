258 A STRATAGEM [b. VI.

self, and a great despiser of the Romans,) one whose name

was Pudens, of the body of horsemen, out of his abomina­

tion of the other's words, and of his impudence withal, and,

perhaps, out of an inconsiderate arrogance, on account of

the other's lowness of stature, ran out to him, and was too

hard for him in other respects, but was betrayed by his ill

fortune; for he fell down; and as he was down, Jonathan

came running to him, and cut his throat; and then standing

upon his dead body, he brandished his sword, bloody as it

was, and shook his shield with his left hand, and made many

acclamations to the Roman army, and insulted over the dead

man, and jested upon the Romans; till at length one Priscus

a centurion shot a dart at him, as he was leaping and playing

the fool with himself, and thereby pierced him through;

upon which a shout was set up both by the Jews and the

Romans, though on different accounts. So Jonathan grew

giddy by the pain of his wounds, and fell down upon the

body of his adversary, as a plain instance how suddenly

vengeance may come upon men that have success in war

without any just deserving the same.

IN THE CITY.

upon the banks; and on the twenty-seventh day of the fore-

named month [Panemus or Tamuz] contrived such a strata­

gem as this: — They filled that part of the western cloister1

which was between the beams and the roof under them with

dry materials, as also with bitumen and pitch, and then re­

tired from that place, as though they were tired with the
