C.X.] SIEGE OF TARICIIBJE, 6'S

so you may not be ignorant who you are, and who they are

against whom we are going to fight. For as to us Romans,

no part of the habitable earth hath been able to escape our

hands hitherto; but as for the Jews, that I may speak of them

too, though they have been already beaten, yet do they not

give up the cause; and a sad thing it would be for us to grow

weary under our good success, when they bear up under their

misfortunes. As to the alacrity which you show publicly, I

see it, and rejoice at it; yet am I afraid lest the multitude

of the enemy should bring a concealed fright upon some of

you: let such a one consider again who we are that are to

fight, and who those are against whom we are to fight. Now

these Jews, though they be very bold, and great despisers of

death, are but a disorderly body, and unskilful in war, and

may rather be called a rout than an army; while I need say

nothing of our skill and our good order; for this is the reason

why we Romans alone are exercised for war in time of peace,

that we may not think of number for number when we come to

fight with our enemies : for what advantage should we reap

for our continual sort of warfare, if we must still be equal in

number to such as have not been used to war ? Consider far­

armed, while you are well armed; with footmen, while you

are horsemen, with those that have no good general, while

you have one; and as these advantages make you in effect

manifold more than you are, so do their disadvantages mightily

diminish their number. Now it is not the multitude of men,

though they be soldiers, that manages wars with success, but

it is their bravery that does it, though they bo but a few; for

a few are easily set in battle array, and can easily assist one

another, while over-numerous armies are more hurt by them­

selves than by their enemies. It is boldness and rashness,

the effects of madness, that conduct the Jews. Those pas­

sions, indeed, make a great figure when they succeed, but arc

quite extinguished upon the least ill success: but wc are led

on by courage, and obedience, and fortitude, which shows it­

self, indeed, in our good fortune, but still does not for cvci

desert us in our ill fortune. Nay, indeed, your fighting is to
