20 TUE ROMAN ARMIES [B. IIL

with three or more darts that are borne in their quiver,

having broad points, and not smaller than spears. They

have also head-pieces and breast-plates, in like manner as

have all the footmen. And for those that are chosen to be

about' the general, their armor no way differs from that of the

horsemen belonging to other troops; and he always leads

the legions forth to whom the lot assigns that employment.

6. This is the manner of the marching and resting of the

Romans, as also these are the several sorts of weapons they

use. But when they are to fight they leave nothing without

forecast, nor to be done off-hand, but counsel is ever first

taken before any work is begun, and what hath been there

resolved upon is put into execution presently: for which

reason they seldom commit any errors, and if they have been

mistaken at any time, they easily correct those mistakes.

They also esteem any errors they commit upon taking counsel

beforehand to be better than such rash success as is owing

to fortune only: because such a fortuitous advantage tempts

them to be inconsiderate, while consultation, though it may

sometimes fail of success, hath this good in it, that it makes

men more careful hereafter; but for the advantages that

arise from chance, they are not owing to him that gains them,

and as to what melancholy accidents happen unexpectedly,

there is this comfort in them, that they had however taken

the best consultations they could to prevent them.

their weapons, that not the bodies of the soldiers only, but

their souls may also become stronger: they are moreover

hardened for war by fear; for their laws inflict capital

punishments, not only for soldiers running away from their

ranks, but for slothfulness and inactivity, though it be but

in a lesser degree; as are their generals more severe than

their laws: for they prevent any imputation of cruelty

towards those under condemnation, by the great rewards

they bestow on the valiant soldiers; and the readiness of

obeying their commanders is so great, that it is very ornaÂ­

mental in peace; but when they come to a battle, the whole

army is but one body, so well coupled together are their
