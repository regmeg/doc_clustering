DISSEKTATION III. 521

was condemned for those flagitious actions, of which both he

and Felix had been guilty, and peace was restored to the

province.1

HISTORY, book v. chap. x.

However, the Jews had patience till Gessius Florus was

made procurator. Under him it was that the war began.

Then Cestius Gallus the president of Syria, attempted to

appease it, tried several battles, but generally with ill success.

Upon his death,2 whether it camo by fate, or that he was

weary of his life, is uncertain, Vespasian had the good

fortune, by his reputation and excellent officers, and a

victorious army, in the space of two summers, to make him­

self master of all the open country, and of all the cities,

Jerusalem excepted.

[Flavius Vespasianus, whom Nero had chosen for his

general, managed the Jewish war with three legions. Histor.

b. i. chap, x.]

The next year, which was employed in a civil war at

[home,] so far as the Jews were concerned, passed over in

peace. When Italy was pacified, the care of foreign parts

was revived. The Jews were the only people that stood out,

which increased the rage [of the Romans.] It was also

thought most proper that Titus should stay with the army,

to prevent any accident or misfortune which the new govern­

ment might be liable to.

[Vespasian had put an end to the Jewish war: the siege

of Jerusalem was the only enterprise remaining, which was a

work hard and difficult, but rather from the nature of the

mountain, and the obstinacy of the Jewish superstition, than

because the besieged had strength enough to undergo the

distresses [of a siege.] We have already informed the reader

1 Here seems to be a great mistake about the Jewish i.flairs in Tacitus.

See of the War, b. ii. ch. xii. sect. 8.

2 Josephus says nothing of the dcath of Cestius; so Tacitus seems to have

known nothing in particular about it.
