but he intrusted the principal management of divine worship

to those that exceeded others in an ability to persuade men,

and in prudence of conduct. These men had the main care

of the law, and of the other parts of the people's conduct

committed to them; for they were the priests who were

ordained to be inspectors of all, and the judges in doubtful

cases, and the punishers of those that were condemned to

suffer punishment.

23. What form of government then can be more holy than

this ? What more worthy kind of worship can be paid to

God than we pay, where the entire body of the people are

What are the things then that we are commanded or forÂ­

agreeable to piety to form a resemblance of him. We see

his works, the light, the heaven, the earth, the sun, and the

moon, the waters, the generations of animals, the productions

of fruits. These things hath God made, not with hands, not

with labor, not as wanting the assistance of any to co-operate

with him ; but as his will resolved they should be made, and

be good also, they were made, and became good immediately.

All men ought to follow this being, and to worship him in the
