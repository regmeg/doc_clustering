168 TITUS AT JERUSALEM. [B. V.

to the city, but declined from him on both sides, and pressed

after those that fled up the hill; yet did he still fall upon

their flank, and put a stop to their fury. In the mean time,

a disorder and a terror fell again upon those that were fortiÂ­

fying their camp at the top of the hill, upon their seeing

those beneath them running away; insomuch that the whole

legion was dispersed, while they thought that the sallies of

the Jews upon them were plainly insupportable, and that

Titus was himself put to flight; because they took it for

granted, that if he had stayed the rest would never have fled

for it. Thus were they encompassed on every side by a kind

of panic fear, and some dispersed themselves one way and

some another, till certain of them saw their general in the

very midst of an action, and, being under great concern for

him, they loudly proclaimed the danger he was in to the

entire legion : and now shame made them turn back, and they

reproached one another that they did worse than run away

by deserting Caesar. So they used their utmost force against

the Jews, and declining from the straight declivity, they drove

them on heaps into the bottom of the valley. Then did the

Jews turn about and fight them ; but as they were themselves

retiring, and now, because the Romans had the advantage of

the ground and were above the Jews, they drove them all into

the valley. Titus also pressed upon those that were near

him. and sent the legion again to fortify their camp; while

he, and those that were with him before, opposed the enemy,

and kept them from doing farther mischief; insomuch that if

I may be allowed neither to add any thing out of flattery,

nor to diminish any thing out of envy, but to speak the plain

truth, Caesar did twice deliver that entire legion when it was

in jeopardy, and gave them a quiet opportunity of fortifying

their camp.
