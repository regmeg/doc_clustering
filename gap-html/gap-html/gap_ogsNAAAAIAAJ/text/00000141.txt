C. IX.] JERUSALEM. 135

when he heard that Galba was made emperor, he attempted

nothing till he also should send him some directions about

the war: however, he sent his son Titus to him to salute him,

and to receive his commands about the Jews. Upon the very

same errand did king Agrippa sail along with Titus to Galba:

but as they were sailing in their long ships by the coasts of

Achaia, for it was winter-time, they heard that Galba was

slain before they could get to him, after he had reigned seven

that he went out with them, and ravaged and destroyed the

country with them about Masada: yet when he persuaded

them to undertake greater things, he could not prevail with

. them so to do; for as they were accustomed to dwell in that

citadel, they were afraid of going far from that which was

their hiding place: but he affecting to tyrannize, and being

fond of greatness, when he had heard of the death of Ananus
