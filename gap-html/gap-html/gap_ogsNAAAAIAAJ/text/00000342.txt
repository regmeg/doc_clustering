against God, nor been partners with those of others; we also

taught other men to preserve their liberty. Wherefore, con­

sider how God hath convinced us that our hopes were in vain,

by bringing such distress upon us in the desperate state we

are now in, and which is beyond all our expectations; for

the nature of this fortress which was in itself unconquer­

for I am well assured that this will be a great grief to the

Romans, that they shall not be able to seize upon our bodies,

and shall fail of our wealth also: and let us spare nothing

but our provisions; for they will be a testimonial when we

are dead, that we were not subdued for want of necessaries,

but that, according to our original resolution, we have pre­

7. This was Eleazar's speech to them. Yet did not the

opinions of all the auditors acquiesce therein; but although

some of them were very zealous to put his advice in practice,

and were in a manner filled with pleasure at it, and thought

death to be a good thing, yet had those that were most ef­

feminate a commiseration for their wives and families; and

when these men were especially moved by the prospect of

their own certain death, they looked wistfully at one another,
