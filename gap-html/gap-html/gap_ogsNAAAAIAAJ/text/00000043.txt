which the engines threw upon them, yet did not they desert

the wall, but fell upon those who managed the ram, under the

protection of the hurdles, with fire, and iron weapons, and

stones: and these could do little or nothing, but fell them­

selves perpetually, while they were seen by those whom they

could not see; for the light of their own flame shone about

them, and made them a most visible mark to the enemy, as

they were in the day-time, while the engines could not be

seen at a great distance, and so what was thrown at them

was hard to be avoided; for the force with which these en­

gines threw stones and darts made them hurt several at a

time, and the violent noise of the stones that were cast by

the engines was so great that they carried away the pinnacles

of the wall, and broke off the corners of the towers; for no

body of men could be so strong as not to be overthrown to

the last rank by the largeness of the stones. And any ono

may learn the force of the engines by what happened this

very night; for as one of those that stood round about Jose-

phus was near the wall, his head was carried away by such a

stone, and his skull was flung as far as three furlongs. In

the day-time also, a woman with child had her belly so vio­

lently struck, as she was just come out of her house, that the

infant was carried to the distance of half a furlong, so great

was the force of that engine. The noise of the instruments

themselves was very terrible; the sound of the darts and

stones that were thrown by them was so also: of the same

sort was the noise the dead bodies made when they wero

dashed against the wall; and, indeed, dreadful was the clamor

which these things raised in the women within the city, whick

was echoed back at the same time by the cries of such as

were slain ; while the whole space of ground whereon they

fought ran with blood, and the wall might have been ascended

over by the bodies of the dead carcasses; the mountains also

contributed to increase the noise by their echoes; nor was

there on that night any thing of terror wanting that could

either affect the hearing or the sight; yet did a great part of

those that fought so hard for Jotapata fall manfully, as wero

a great part of them wounded. However, the morning-watch
