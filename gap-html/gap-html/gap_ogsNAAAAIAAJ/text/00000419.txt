B. II.] AGAINST A PI ON. 418

mean not particular men, but entire and large nations them­

selves also; for those anciently named Iberi, and Tyrrheni,

and Sabini, arc now called Romani. And if Apion reject

this way of obtaining the privilege of a citizen of Alexandria,

let him abstain from calling himself an Alexandrian here­

after ; for otherwise how can he who was born in the very

heart of Egypt be an Alexandrian, if this way of accepting

such a privilege, of which he would have us deprived, be once

abrogated ? although, indeed, these Romans, who are now the

lords of the habitable earth, have forbidden the Egyptians to

have the privileges of any city whatsoever; while this fine

fellow, who is willing to partake of such a privilege himself as

he is forbidden to make use of, endeavors by calumnies to de­

prive those of it that have justly received it: for Alexander

did not, therefore, get some of our nation to Alexandria, be­

cause he wanted inhabitants for this his city, on whose build­

ing he had bestowed so much pains : but this was given to our

people as a reward, because he had, upon a careful trial, found

them all to have been men of virtue and fidelity to him; for,

as Hecateus says concerning us, " Alexander honored our

nation to such a degree that, for the equity and the fidelity

which the Jews had exhibited to him, he permitted them to

hold the country of Samaria free from tribute. Of the same

mind also was Ptolemy, the son of Lagus, as to those Jews

who dwelt at Alexandria;" for he intrusted the fortresses of

Egypt into their hands, as believing they would keep them

faithfully and valiantly for him; and when he was desirous

to secure the government of Cyrene and the other cities of

Libya to himself, he sent a party of Jews to inhabit them.

And for his successor Ptolemy, who was called Philadelphia,

he did not only set all those of our nation free who were cap­

tives under him, but did frequently1 give money [for their

ransom;] and, what was his greatest work of all, he had a

1 For iroXXa<i(, or frequeatly, I wuuld here read noXXa, a great deal of
money;

for we, indeed, read both in Aristeas and Josephus, that this Ptolemy Phila­

delphia once gave a very great sum of money to redeem above 100,000 Jew­

ish captives, but not of any sums of money, which he disbursed on their

account at other times, that I know of.
