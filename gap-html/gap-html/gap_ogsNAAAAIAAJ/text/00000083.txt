dejected by reflecting on their ill success, and because they

had never before fallen into such a calamity, and besides this,

because they were greatly ashamed that they had left their

general alone in great dangers. As to what concerned him­

self, he avoided to say any thing, that he might by no means

seem to complain of it; but he said that " we ought to bear

manfully what usually falls out in war, and this by consider­

ing what the nature of war is, and how it can never be that

we must conquer without bloodshed on our own side; for there

stands about us that fortune which is of its own nature muta­

Jews, they had now paid their small share of the reckoning

this incautiousness in war, and this madness of zeal, is not a

Roman maxim, while we perform all that we attempt by skill

and good order: that procedure is the part ef barbarians, and

is what the Jews chiefly support themselves by. We ought,

therefore, to return to our own virtue, and to be rather angry

than any longer dejected at this unlucky misfortune, and let

every one seek for his own consolation from his own hand;

for by this means she will avenge those that have been des­
