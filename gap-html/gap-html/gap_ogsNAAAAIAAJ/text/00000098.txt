92 THE HIGH-PRIEST ANANUS. [B. IV.

the son of Josephus, and Symeon1 the son of Gamaliel, who

encouraged them, by going up and down when they were as­

sembled together in crowds, and as they saw them alone, to

bear no longer, but to inflict punishment upon these pests

and plagues of their freedom, and to purge the temple of

these bloody polluters of it. The best esteemed also of the

high-priests, Jesus the son of Gamala, and Ananus the son of

Ananus, when they were at their assemblies, bitterly re­

proached the people for their sloth, and excited them against

the zealots; for that was the name they went by, as if they

were zealous in good undertakings, and were not rather zeal­

ous in the worst actions, and extravagant in them beyond

the example of others.

10. And now, when the multitude were gotten together to

an assembly, and every one was in indignation at these men's

seizing upon the sanctuary, at their rapine and murders, but

had not yet begun their attacks upon them (the reason of

sacred places, that ought not to be trodden upon at random,

filled with the feet of these blood-shedding villains; yet do I,

who am clothed with the vestments of high-priesthood, and

am called by that most venerable name [of high-priest,] still

live, and am but too fond of living, and cannot endure to un­

dergo a death which would be the glory of my old age; and

if 1 were the only person concerned, and as it were in a

desert, I would give up my life, and that alone for God's

sake; for to what purpose is it to live among a people insen­

1 This Symeon, the son of Gamaliel, is mentioned as the president of the

Jewish sanhedrim, and one that perished in thu destruction of Jerusalem, by

the Jewish rabbins, as Reland observes on this place. He also tells us, that

those rabbins mention one Jesus, the son of Gamala, ns once a high-priest,

but this long before the destruction of Jerusalem; so that if he were the

same person with this Jesus, the son of Gamala, in Josephus, he must have

lived to be very old, or they have been very bad chronologers.
