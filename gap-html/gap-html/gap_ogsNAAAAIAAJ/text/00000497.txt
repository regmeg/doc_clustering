DISSERTATION II.

CONCERNING GOD'S COMMAND TO ABRAHAM TO OFFER UP

ISAAC, HIS SON, FOR A SACRIFICE.

Since this command of God to Abraham1 has of late been

greatly mistaken by some, who venture to reason about very

ancient facts from very modern notions, and this without a

due regard to either the customs, or opinions, or circum­

stances of the times whereto those facts belong, or indeed to

the true reasons of the facts themselves; since the mistakes

about those customs, opinions, circumstances, and reasons,

have of late so far prevailed, that the very same action of

Abraham's, which was so celebrated by St. Paul,2 St. James,3

the author to the Hebrews,4 Philo,6 and Josephus," in the

first century, and by innumerable others since, as an uncom­

mon instance of signal virtue, of heroic faith in God, and

piety towards him; nay, is in the sacred history7 highly com­

mended by the divine angel of the covenant, in the name of

God himself, and promised to be plentifully rewarded; since

this command, I say, is now at last in the eighteenth century

become a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence among

us, and that sometimes to persons of otherwise good sense,

and of a religious disposition of mind also, I shall endeavor

to set this matter in its true, i. e. in its ancient and original

light, for the satisfaction of the inquisitive. In order whereto

we are to consider.

1. That, till this very profane age, it has been, I think,

universally allowed by all sober persons, who owned them­

selves the creatures of God, that the Creator has a just right

over all his rational creatures, to protract their lives to what

length he pleases ; to cut them off when and by what instru­

ments he pleases; to afflict them with what sickness he pleases,
