320 DISSERTATION III.

ANNALS, book xii.

But he that was the brother of Pallas, whose surname was

Felix, did not act with the same moderation [as did Pallas

himself.] He had been a good while ago set over Judea,

and thought he might be guilty of all sorts of wickedness

with impunity, while he relied on so sure an authority.

The Jews had almost given a specimen of sedition; and
