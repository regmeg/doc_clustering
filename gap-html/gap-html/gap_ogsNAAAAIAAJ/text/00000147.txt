C. IX.] SIMON OF GEUASA. 141

retire to Jerusalem; he followed them himself also to the

city, and encompassed the wall all around again; and when

he lighted upon any laborers that were coming thither out of

the country, he slew them. Now this Simon, who was with­

out the wall, was a greater terror to the people than the Ro­

mans themselves, as were the zealots who were within it more

heavy upon them than both of the other; and during this

time did the mischievous contrivances and courage [of John]

corrupt the body of the Galileans; for these Galileans had

advanced this John, and made him very potent, who made

them a suitable requital from the authority he had obtained

by their means; for he permitted them to do all things that

any of them desired to do, while their inclination to plunder

was insatiable, as was their zeal in searching the houses of

the rich; and for the murdering of the men and abusing of

the women it was sport to them. They also devoured what

spoils they had taken, together with their blood, and indulged

themselves in feminine wantonness, without any disturbance

till they were satiated therewith; while they decked their

hair, and put on women's garments, and were besmeared over

with ointments; and, that they might appear very comely,

they had paints under their eyes, and imitated not only the

ornaments, but also the lusts of women, and were guilty of

such intolerable uncleanness, that they invented unlawful

pleasures of that sort; and thus did they roll themselves up

and down the city, as in a brothel-housc, and defiled it en­

tirely with their impure actions; nay, while their faces looked

like the faces of women, they killed with their right hands;

and when their gait was effeminate, they presently attacked

men and became warriors, and drew their swords from under

their finely dyed cloaks, and ran every body through whom

they alighted upon. However, Simon waited for such as ran

away from John, and was the more bloody of the two; and

ho who had escaped the tyrant within the walls was destroyed

by the other that lay before the gates; so that all attempts

of flying and deserting to the Romans were cut off as to those

that had a mind so to do.
