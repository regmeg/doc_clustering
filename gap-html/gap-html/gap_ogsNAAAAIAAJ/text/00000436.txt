ous, I have a mind to discourse briefly according to my

ability, about our whole constitution of government and about

the particular branches of it. For I suppose it will thence

become evident, that the laws we have given us are disposed

after the best manner for the advancement of piety, for

mutual communion with one another, for a general love of

mankind, as also for justice, and for sustaining labors with

fortitude, and for a contempt of death. And I beg of those

that shall peruse this writing of mine to read it without par­

tiality ; for it is not my purpose to write an encomium upon

ourselves, but I shall esteem this as a most just apology for

us, and taken from those our laws, according to which we

lead our lives, against the many and the lying objections that

have been made against us. Moreover, since this Apollonius

does not do like Apion, and lay a continued accusation

against us, but docs it only by starts, and up and down his

discourse, while he sometimes reproaches us as atheists and

man-haters, and sometimes hits us in the teeth with our want

of courage, and yet sometimes, on the contrary, accuses us

of too great boldness and madness in our conduct; nay, he

says that we are the weakest of all the barbarians ; and that

this is the reason why we are the only people which have

made no improvements in human life. Now I think I shall

have then sufficiently disproved all these his allegations, when

it shall appear that our laws enjoin the very reverse of what

he says, and that we very carefully observe those laws our­

selves. And if I be compelled to make mention of the laws

of other nations that are contrary to ours, those ought de­

servedly to thank themselves for it, who have pretended to

depreciate our laws in comparison of their own ; nor will

there, I think, be any room after that for them to pretend

either that we have no such laws ourselves, an epitome of

which I will present to the reader, or that we do not, above

all men, continue in the observation of them.

16. To begin, then, a good way backward, I would advanco

this in the first place, that those who have been admirers of

good order, and of living under common laws, and who began

to introduce them, may well have this testimony, that they
