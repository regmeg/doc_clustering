eral, with regard to all the Romans, and those emperors that

were her benefactors ; who also had her sister Arsinoe slain

in a temple, when she had done her no harm : moreover, she

had her brother slain by private treachery, and she destroyed

the gods of her country and the sepulehres of her progenitors;

and while she had received her kingdom from the first Caesar,

she had the impudence to rebel against his son' and successor:

nay, she corrupted Antony with her love-trick, and rendered

him an enemy to his country, and made him treacherous to his

friends, and [by his means] despoiled some of their royal au­

thority, and forced others in her madness to act wickedly.

But what need I enlarge upon this head any farther, when

she left Antony in his fight at sea, though he were her hus­

band, and the father of their common children, and compelled

him to resign up his government, with the army, and to follow

her [into Egypt:] nay, when last of all, Caesar had taken

Alexandria, she came to that pitch of cruelty, that she de­

clared she had some hopes of preserving her affairs still, in

case she could kill the Jews, though it were with her own

hand ; to such a degree of barbarity and perfidiousness had

she arrived. And doth any one think that we cannot boast

ourselves of any thing, if, as Apion says, this queen did not

at a time of famine distribute wheat among us ? However,

she at length met with the punishment she deserved. As for

us Jews, we appeal to the great Ciesar what assistance we

brought him, and what fidelity we showed to him against the

Egyptians; as also to the senate and its decrees, and the

epistles of Augustus Cffisar, whereby our merits [to the Ro­

mans] are justified. Apion ought to have looked upon those

epistles, and, in particular, to have examined the testimonies

given on our behalf under Alexander and all the Ptolemies,

and the decrees of the senate and of the greatest Roman em­

perors. And if Germanicus was not able to make a distribu­

tion of corn to all the inhabitants of Alexandria, that only

shows what a barren time it was, and how great a want there

was then of corn, but tends nothing to the accusation of the

Jews ; for what all the emperors have thought of the Alexan­

1 Sister's son, and adopted son.
