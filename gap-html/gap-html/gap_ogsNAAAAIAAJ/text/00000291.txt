C. VIII.] SIEGE OF THE UPPER CITY. 285

after the whole city should be destroyed, and the Romans

gone away, they might come out again, and escape from them.

This was no better than a dream of theirs; for they were

not able to lie hid either from God or from the Romans.

However, they depended on these underground subterfuges,

and set more places on fire than did the Romans themselves;

and those that fled out of their houses, thus set on fire, into

ditches, they killed without mercy, and pillaged them also;

and if they discovered food belonging to any one, they seized

upon it, and swallowed it down, together with their blood

also; nay, they were now come to fight one with another

about their plunder; and I cannot but think, that, had not

their destruction prevented it, their barbarity would havo

made them taste of even the dead bodies themselves.

CHAPTER VIII.

HOW CESAR RAISED BANKS ROUND ABOUT THE UPPER CITY,1

AND WHEN THEY WERE COMPLETED GAVE ORDERS THAT THE

MACHINES SHOULD BE BROUGHT: HE THEN POSSESSED HIM­

SELF OF THE WHOLE CITY.

§ 1. Now when Caesar perceived that the upper city was

so steep, that it could not possibly be taken without raising

banks against it, he distributed the several parts of that work

among his army, and this on the twentieth day of the month

Lous [Ab.] Now, the carriage of the materials was a diffi­

cult task, since all the trees, as I have already told you, that

were about the city within the distance of a hundred furlongs,

had their branches cut off already, in order to make the for­

mer banks. The works that belonged to the four legions were

erected on the west side of the city, over against the royal

palace; but the whole body of the auxiliary troops, with the

rest of the multitude that were with them [erected their

banks] at the Xystus, whence they reached to the bridge,

and that tower of Simon which he had built as a citadel for

1 t e. Mount Sion.
