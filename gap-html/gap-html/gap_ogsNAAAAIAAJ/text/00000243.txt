0. I.] THE SIEGE. 237

the violence of their attacks was invincible, and that the alac­

rity they showed would not be discouraged by their calami-

ties ; for what would not those be able to bear if they should

be fortunate, who turned their very misfortunes to the im­

provement of their valor? These considerations made the

Romans to keep a stronger guard about their banks than they

formerly had done.

themselves afterward, even in case this wall should be thrown

down, and fell to their work before the battering-rams were

courage, madness for armor, multitude for skill, and Jews for

Romans. The Romans had now also another advantage, in

that their engines for sieges co-operated with them in throwing

darts and stones as far as the Jews, when they were coming
