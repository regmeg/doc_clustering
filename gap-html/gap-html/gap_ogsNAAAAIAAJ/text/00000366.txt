Thucydides himself is accused of some as writing what is

false, although he seems to have given us the exactest history

of the affairs of his own time.

4. As for the occasions of so great disagreement of theirs,

there may be assigned many that are very probable, if any

have a mind to make an inquiry about them; but I ascribe

these contradictions chiefly to two causes, which I will now

mention, and still think what I shall mention in the first

place to bo the principal of all: For, if we remember, that

in the beginning the Greeks had taken no care to have public

records of their several transactions preserved, this must for

certain have afforded those that would afterward write about

those ancient transactions the opportunity of making mis­

takes, and the power of making lies also; for this original

recording of such ancient transactions hath not only been

neglected by the other states of Greece, but even among

the Athenians themselves also, who pretend to bo aborigines,

and to have applied themselves to learning, there are no such

records extant; nay, they say themselves, that the laws of

Draco concerning murders, which are now extant in writing,

are the most ancient of their public records; which Draco

yet lived but a little before the tyrant Pisistratus.1 For as

to the Arcadians, who make such boasts of their antiquity,

what need I speak of them in particular, since it was still

later before they got their letters, and learned them, and that

with difficulty also?

5. There must, therefore, naturally arise great differences

among writers when they had no original records to lay for

their foundation, which might at once inform those who had

an inclination to learn, and contradict those that would tell

lies. However, we are to suppose a second occasion, besides

the former, of these contradictions; it is this.—That those

who were the most zealous to write history were not solici­

tous for the discovery of truth,2 although it was very easy

* It is here well worth our observation, what the reasons are that such  
ancient authors as Herodotus, Josephus, and others, have been read to so

little purpose by many learned crities, viz.: that their main aim has not
