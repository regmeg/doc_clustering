was come ere the wall yielded to the machines employed

against it, though it had been battered without intermission.

However, those within covered their bodies with their armor,

and raised works over against that part which was thrown

down, before those machines were laid, by which the Romans

were to ascend into the city.

24. In the morning Vespasian got his army together in

order to take the city [by storm,] after a little recreation

the guard of the parts that were thrown down, while the rest

of them should be overborne by the darts cast at them, and

might afford his men an entrance into the city.

were tired out, at the sound parts of the wall, as expecting

no harm from those quarters, but set the strongest of his men

at the place where the wall was broken down, and before them

all six men by themselves, among whom he took his share of

the first and greatest danger. He also gave orders, that
