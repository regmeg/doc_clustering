JOSEPHUS'S DISCOURSE TO THE GREEKS

HADES.

§ 1. Now as to Hades, wherein the souls of the righteous

and unrighteous are detained, it is necessary to speak of it.

Hades is a place in the world not regularly finished; a

subterraneous region, wherein the light of this world does

not shine; from which circumstance, that in this region the

light does not shine, it cannot but be there must be in it per­

petual darkness. This region is allotted as a place of custody

for souls, in which angels are appointed as guardians to them,

who distribute to them temporary putiishments, agreeable to

every one's behavior and manners.

2. In this region there is a certain place set apart as a

lake of unquenchable fire; whereinto we suppose no one hath

hitherto been cast; but it is prepared for a day afore-

determined by God, in which one righteous sentence shall

deservedly be passed upon all men; when the unjust, and

those that have been disobedient to God, and have given

honor to such idols as have been the vain operations of the

hands of men as to God himself, shall be adjudged to this

everlasting punishment, as having been the causes of defile­

ment; while the just shall obtain an incorruptible and never-

fading kingdom. These are now, indeed, confiued in Hades,

but not in the same place wherein the unjust are confined.
