196 EVENTS OF THE SIEGE. [B. V

out of the reach of the darts, and did no longer endeavor to

hinder the impressions of their rams, which, by continually

beating upon the wall, did gradually prevail against it; so

that the wall already gave way to the Nico; for by that name

did the Jews themselves call the greatest of their engines,

because it conquered all things. And now they were for a

long while grown weary of fighting, and of keeping guards,

and were retired to lodge on the night-times at a distance

from the wall. It was on other accounts also thought by

them to be superfluous to guard the wall, there being besides

army also took for their share the spot of ground that was

near John's monument, and fortified it as far as to that gate

where water was brought into the tower Hippicus. However,

the Jews made violent sallies, and that frequently also, and

in bodies together, out of the gates, and there fought the

Romans; and when they were pursued all together to the

wall, they were beaten in those fights, as wanting the skill of
