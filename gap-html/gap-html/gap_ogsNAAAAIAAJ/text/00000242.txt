any hope of victory; for they glorified after a brutish manner

in that despair of deliverance they were already in. And

now the Romans, although they were greatly distressed in

getting together their materials, raised their banks in one and

twenty days, after they had cut down all the trees that were

in the country that adjoined to the city, and that for ninety

furlongs round about, as I have already related. And, truly,

the very view itself of the country was a melancholy thing:

for those places which were before adorned with trees and

pleasant gardens, were now become a desolate country every

way, and its trees were all cut down ; nor could any foreigner

that had formerly seen Judea and the most beautiful suburbs

of the city, and now saw it as a desert, but lament and mourn

sadly at so great a change; for the war had laid all the signs

of beauty quite waste; nor if any one that had known the

place before had come on a sudden to it now, would he have

known it again; but though he were at the city itself, yet

would he have inquired for it notwithstanding.

dation for fear both to the Romans and to the Jews; for tho

Jews expected that the city would be taken, unless they could

burn those banks, as did the Romans expect that, if these

were once burnt down, they should never be able to take it;

for there was a mighty scarcity of materials, and the bodies

of the soldiers began to fail with such hard labors, as did

their souls faint with so many instances of ill success; nay,

the very calamities themselves that were in the city proved a

greater discouragement to the Romans than to those within

the city; for they found the fighting-men of the Jews to bo

not at all mollified among such their sore afflictions, while they

had themselves perpetually less and less hopes of success, and

their hanks were forced to yield to tho stratagems of the

enemy, their engines to the firmness of their wall, and their

closest fights to the boldness of their attack; and, what was

their greatest discouragement of all, they found the Jews'

courageous souls to be superior to the multitude of the mise­

ries they were under by their sedition, their famine, and the

war itself; insomuch that they were ready to imagine, that
