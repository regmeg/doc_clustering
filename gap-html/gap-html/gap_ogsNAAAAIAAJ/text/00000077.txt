friends were too hard for him, and pretended that nothing

against Jews could be any impiety; and that he ought to

prefer what was profitable before what was fit to be done,

where both could not be made consistent. So he gave them

an ambiguous liberty to do as they advised, and permitted

the prisoners to go along no other road than that which led

to Tiberias only. So they readily believed what they de­

sired to be true, and went along securely, with their effects,

the way which was allowed them, while the Romans seized

upon all the road that led to Tiberias, that none of them

might go out of it, and shut them up in the city. Then

came Vespasian, and ordered them all to stand in the stadium,

and commanded them to kill the old men, together with the

others that were useless, which were in number a thousand

and two hundred. Out of the young men he chose six thou­

sand of the strongest, and sent them to Nero, to dig through

the isthmus, and sold the remainder for slaves, being thirty

thousand and four hundred, besides such as he made a

present of to Agrippa; for as to those that belonged to his

kingdom, he gave him leave to do what he pleased with them:

however, the king sold these also for slaves; but for the

rest of the multitude who were Trachonites, and Gaulanites,

and of Hippos, and some of Gadara, the greatest part of

them were seditious persons and fugitives, who were of such

shameful characters that they preferred war before peace.

These prisoners were taken on the eighth day of the month
