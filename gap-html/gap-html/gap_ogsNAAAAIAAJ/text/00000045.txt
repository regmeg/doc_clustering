that they might not be affrighted at it, and that, to avoid the

multitude of the enemy's darts, they should bend down on

their knees, and cover themselves with their shields; and

all those who brought ladders to the other places he took no

notice of them, but earnestly waited for the shower of arrows

that was coming.

27. And now the trumpeters of the several Roman legion3

sounded together, and the army made a terrible shout, and

th? darts, as by order, flew so fast, that they intercepted the
