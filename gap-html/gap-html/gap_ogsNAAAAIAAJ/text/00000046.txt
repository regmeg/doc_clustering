light. However, Joscphus's men remembered the charges he

had given them; they stopped their ears at the sounds, and

covered their bodies against the darts; and as to the engines

that were set ready to go to work, the Jews ran out upon

them, before those that should have used them were gotten

upon them. And now, on the ascending of the soldiers, there

was a great conflict, and many actions of the hands and of

the soul were exhibited, while the Jews did earnestly en足

horrid pains; for the oil did easily run down the whole body

from head to foot, under their entire armor, and fed upon

their flesh like flame itself, its fat and unctuous nature ren足

dering it soon heated and slowly cooled; and as the men

were cooped up in their head-pieces and breast-plates, they
