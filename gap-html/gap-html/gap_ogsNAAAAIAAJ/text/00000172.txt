166 TITUS AT JERUSALEM. [D. V.

took their armor immediately, and ran out upon the tenth

legion, and fell upon the Romans with great eagerness, and

with a prodigious shout, as they were fortifying their camp.

These Romans were caught in different parties, and this is in

order to perform their several works, and on that account

had in a great measure laid aside their arms; for they thought

the Jews would not have ventured to make a sally upon them;

and, had they been disposed so to do, they supposed their

of the case they were in, and had sent them succors imme­

diately. So he reproached them for their cowardice, and

brought those back that were running away, and fell himself

upon the Jews in their flank, with those select troops that

were with him, and slew a considerable number, and wounded
