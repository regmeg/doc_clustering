234 GREAT SLAUGHTERS AND SACRILEGE. [B. V.

cast them out of the city. After this man there ran away to

Titus many of the eminent citizens, and told him the entire

number, of the poor that were dead, and that no fewer than

six hundred thousand were thrown out at the gates; though

still the number of the rest could not be discovered: and they

told him farther, that, when they were no longer able to

carry out the dead bodies of the poor, they laid their corpses

on heaps in very large houses, and shut them up therein; as

also that a medimnus of wheat was sold for a talent, and that

when a while afterward, it was not possible to gather herbs,

oy reason the city was all walled about, some persons were

driven to that terrible stress as to search the common sewers

and old dunghills of cattle, and to eat the dung which they got

there; and what they of old could not endure so much as to

see, they now used for food. When the Romans barely heard

all this, they commiserated their case; while the seditious,

who saw it also, did not repent, but suffered the same distress

to come upon themselves; for they were blinded by that fate

which was already coming upon the city, and upon themselves

also.
