C. VI.] TITUS PRESSES THE SIEGE. 193

leave, by proclamation, to go upon the wall; John also him­

self, though he could not believe that Simon was in earnest,

gave them the same leave. So, on both sides, they laid aside

their ffatred and their peculiar quarrels, and formed them­

selves into one body; they then ran round the walls, and

having a vast number of torches with them, they threw them

at the machines, and shot darts perpetually upon those that

impelled those engines which battered the wall; nay, the

bolder sort leaped out by troops upon the hurdles that covered

the machines, and pulled them to pieces, and fell upon those

that belonged to them, and beat them, not so much by any

skill they had, as principally by the boldness of their attacks.

However, Titus himself still sent assistance to those that

were the hardest set, and placed both horsemen and archers

on the several sides of the engines, and thereby beat off those

that brought the fire to them ; he also thereby repelled those

that shot stones or darts from the towers, and then set the

engines to work in good earnest: yet did not the wall yield

to these blows, excepting where the battering-ram of the fif­

teenth legion moved the corner of a tower, while the wall

itself continued unhurt; for the wall was not presently in the

same danger with the tower, which was extant far above it:

nor could the fall of that part of the tower easily break down

any part of the wall itself together with it.

but when they observed the Romans dispersing all abroad at

their works, and in their several camps (for they thought the

Jews had retired out of weariness and fear,) these all at once

made a sally at the tower Hippicus, through an obscure gate,

and at the same time brought fire to burn the works, and

went boldly up to the Romans, and to their very fortifications

themselves, where, at the cry they made, those that were

near came presently to their assistance, and those farther off

came running after them; and here the boldness of the Jews

was too hard for the good order of the Romans; and as they

beat those whom they first fell upon, so they pressed upon

those that were now gotten together. So this fight about
