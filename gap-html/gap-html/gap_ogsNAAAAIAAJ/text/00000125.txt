C. VI.] OF VESPASIAN. 119

done, as those that, upon the theatre, love to make a show

of their hands and of their weapons, but do it to their own

hazard, without considering what was for their advantage and

for their security; for that if they now go and attack the city

immediately, they shall but occasion their enemies to unite

together, and shall convert their force, now it is in its height,

against themselves ; but if they stay awhile, they shall have

fewer enemies, because they will be consumed in this sedition:

that God acts as a general of the Romans better than he can

do, and is giving the Jews up to them without any pains of

their own, and granting their army a victory without any

danger: that, therefore, it is their best way, while their ene­

mies are destroying each other with their own hands, and

falling into the greatest of misfortunes, which is that of sedi­

tion, to sit still as spectators of the dangers they run into,

rather than to fight hand-to-hand with men that love murder­

ing, and are mad one against another. But if any one ima­

gines that the glory of victory, when it is gotten without

fighting, will be more insipid, let him know this much, that a

glorious success quietly obtained is more profitable than the

dangers of a battle; for we ought to esteem those that do

what is agreeable to temperance and prudence no less glorious

than those that have gained great reputation by their actions

in war: that he shall lead on his army with greater force

when their enemies are diminished, and his own army re­

freshed after the continual labors they had undergone. How­

ever, that this is not a proper time to propose to ourselves the

glory of victory ; for that the Jews are not now employed in

making of armor or building of walls, nor, indeed, in getting

together auxiliaries, while the advantage will be on their side

who gave them such opportunity of delay; but that the Jews

are vexed to pieces every day by their civil wars and dissen­

sions, and arc under greater miseries than, if they were once

taken, could bo inflicted on them by us. Whether, therefore,

any one hath regard to what is for our safety, he ought to

suffer these Jews to destroy one another, or whether ho hath

regard to the greater glory of the action, we ought by no

means to meddle with these men, now they are afflicted with
