152 AFFAIRS AT ROME. [B. IV.

before the city, and fell into the city, together with the rest,

and gave leave to his soldiers to plunder it. And here it was

that many strangers who were merchants, as well as many

of the people of that country, perished, and among them Vi-

tellius's whole army, being thirty thousand and two hundred,
