of them have not obtained the privileges of citizens in proper

times, but style those who are well known to have had that

privilege extended to them all no other than foreigners; for

it does not appear that any of the kings have ever formerly

bestowed those privileges of citizens upon Egyptians, no more

than have the emperors done it more lately; while it was

Alexander who introduced us into this city at first, the kings

augmented our privileges therein, and the Romans have been

pleased to preserve them always inviolable. Moreover, Apion

would lay a blot upon us, because we do not erect images for

our emperors; as if those emperors did not know this before,

or stood in need of Apion as their defender; whereas he ought

rather to have admired the magnanimity and modesty of the

Romans, whereby they do not compel those that are subject

to them to transgress the laws of their countries, but are

willing to receive the honors due to them after such a manner

as those who are to pay them esteem consistent with piety

and with their own laws ; for they do not thank people for

conferring honors upon them, when they are compelled by

violence so to do. Accordingly, since the Grecians and some

other nations think it aright thing to make images; nay,

when they have painted the pictures of their parents, and

wives, and children, they exult for joy; and some there are

who take pictures for themselves of such persons as were no

way related to them; nay, some take the pictures of such

servants as they were fond of. What wonder is it, then, if

such as these appear willing to pay the same respect to their

princes and lords ? But, then, our legislator hath forbidden

us to make images, not by way of denunciation beforehand,

that the Roman authority was not to be honored, but as de­

spising a thing that was neither necessary nor useful for either

God or man; and he forbade them, as we shall prove here­

after, to make these images for any part of the animal crea­

tion, and much less for God himself, who is no part of such

animal creation. Yet hath our legislator nowhere forbidden

us to pay honors to worthy men, provided they be of another

kind, and inferior to those we pay to God : with which honors

we willingly testify our respect to our emperors and to the
