332 MASADA AND THE SICARII. [B. VII

and his Sicarii got possession of the fortress by treachery.

These fruits were also fresh and full ripe, and no way inferior

to such fruits newly laid in, although they were little short of a

hundred yearsl from the laying in these provisions [by Herod]

till the place was taken by the Romans; nay, indeed, when

the Romans got possession of those fruits that were left, they

found them not corrupted all that while; nor should we be

mistaken if we supposed that the air was here the cause of

their enduring so long, this fortress being so high, and so free

from the mixture of all terrene and muddy particles of matter.

There was also found here a large quantity of all sorts of wea­

pons of war, which had been treasured up by that king, and

were sufficient for ten thousand men: there was cast iron, and

brass, and tin, which show that he had taken much pains to

have all things here ready for the greatest occasions: for the

report goes how Herod thus prepared this fortress on his own

account, as a refuge against two kinds of danger; the one,

for fear of the multitude of the Jews, lest they should depose

him, and restore their former kings to the government: the

other danger was greater and more terrible, which arose from

Cleopatra, queen of Egypt, who did not conceal her inten­

tions, but spake often to Antony, and desired him to cut off

Herod, and entreated him to bestow the kingdom of Judca

upon her. And certainly it is a great wonder that Antony

did never comply with her commands on this point, as he was

so miserably enslaved to his passion for her; nor should any

one have been surprised if she had been gratified in such her

request. So the fear of these dangers made Herod rebuild

Masada, and thereby leave it for the finishing stroke of the

Romans in this Jewish war.

5. Since, therefore, the Roman commander Silva had now

built a wall on the outside round about this whole place, as we

have said already, and had thereby made a most accurate

provision to prevent any one of the besieged running away,

he undertook the siege itself, though he found but one single

place that would admit of the banks ho was to raise: for bc­

1 Pliny and others confirm this strange paradox, that provisions laid up

against sieges will continue good a hundred years, as Spaubciui notes upon

this plac<>.
