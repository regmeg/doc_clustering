mentions: he then ascribes certain fabulous stories to this

king, as having in a manner forgotten how he had already

related that the departure of the shepherds for Jerusalem

had been five hundred and eighteen years before; for Teth-

mosis was king when they went away. Now, from his days,

the reigns of the intermediate kings, according to Manetho,

amounted to three hundred and ninety-three years, as he

says himself, till the two brothers, Sethos and Hermeus; the

one of which, Sethos, was called bv that other name of

Egyptians." He says farther, that " there were some of the

learned priests that were polluted with the leprosy; but that

still this Amenophis, the wise man and the prophet, was

afraid that the gods would be angry at him and at the king,

if there should appear to have been violence offered them;

who also added this farther [out of his sagacity about

futurities,] that certain people would come to the assistance

of these polluted wretches, and would conquer Egypt, and

keep it in their possession thirteen years : that, however, he
