288 SIEGE OF THE UPPER CITY. [B. VI.

the seditious, some of them, as despairing of saving the city,

rotired from the wall to the citadel; others of them went

down into the subterranean vaults, though still a great many

of them defended themselves against those that brought the

engines for the battery; yet did the Romans overcome them

by their number and by their strength, and what was the

principal thing of all, by going cheerfully about their work,

while the Jews were quite dejected and become weak. Now,

as soon as a part of the wall was battered down, and certain

of the towers yielded to the impression of the battering-rams,

those that opposed themselves fled away, and such a terror

And now, one might see these men, who had hitherto been

exercised upon these wicked wretches, and on the good for足

tune of the Romans; for these tyrants did now wholly de足

prive themselves of the security they had in their own power,

and came down from those very towers of their own accord,

wherein they could have never been taken by force, nor, in足

deed, any other way than by famine. And thus did the Ro足
