C. III.] THE HIGH-PRIEST ANANUS. 95

and slaughtering our men, from which enormities these Ro­

mans themselves would have abstained. To see these Romans

never going beyond the bounds allotted to profane persons,

nor venturing to break in upon any of our sacred customs,

nay, having a horror on their minds when they view at a

distance those sacred walls, while some that have been born

in this very country, and brought up in our customs, and

called Jews, do walk about in the midst of the holy places, at

the very time when their hands are still warm with the

slaughter of their own countrymen. Besides, can any one be

afraid of a war abroad, and that with such as will have com­

paratively much greater moderation than our own people

have ? For truly, if we may suit our words to the things they

represent, it is probable one may hereafter find the Romans

to be the supporters of our laws, and those within ourselves

subverters of them. And now I am persuaded that every

one of you here come satisfied before I speak, that these

overthrowers of our liberties deserve to be destroyed; and

that nobody can so much as devise a punishment that they

have not deserved by what they have done, and that you are

all provoked against them by those their wicked actions,

whence you have suffered so greatly. But, perhaps, many

of you are affrighted at the multitude of those zealots, and at

their audaciousness, as well as at the advantage they have

over us in their being higher in place than we are; for these

circumstances, as they have been occasioned by your negli­

gence, so will they become still greater by being still longer

neglected; for their multitude is every day augmented, by

every ill man's running away to those that arc like to them­

selves, and their audaciousness is, therefore, inflamed, be­

cause they meet with no obstruction to their designs. And

for their higher place, they will make use of it for engines

also, if we give them time to do so; but be assured of this,

that if we go up to fight them, they will be made tamer by

their own consciences; and what advantage they have in the

height of their situation they will lose by the opposition of

their reason: perhaps also God himself, who hath been

affronted by them, will make what they throw at us return
