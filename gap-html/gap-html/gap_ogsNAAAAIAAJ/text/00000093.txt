C.III.] JOHNOFGISCHALA. 87

come to them, and inquired of them what miseries had

happened abroad, when their breath was so short, and hot,

and quick, that of itself it declared the great distress they

were in; yet did they talk big under their misfortunes, and

pretended to say, that they had not fled away from the

Romans, but came thither in order to fight them with less

hazard, for that it would be an unreasonable and a fruitless

thing for them to expose themselves to desperate hazards

about Gischala and such weak cities, whereas they ought to

lay up their weapons and their zeal, and reserve it for their

metropolis. But when they related to them the taking of

Gischala, and their decent departure, as they pretended,

from that place, many of the people understood it to be no

told of those that were made captives, they were in great

confusion, and guessed those things to be plain indications

that they should be taken also. But for John, he was very

themselves wings, could never fly over the wall of Jerusalem,

who found such great difficulties in taking the villages of

Galilee, and had broken their engines of war against their walls.

2. These harangues of John's corrupted a great part of

the young men, and puffed them up for the war ; but as to

the more prudent part, and those in years, there was not a

man of them but foresaw what was coming, and made lamenÂ­

tation on that account, as if the city was already undone:

and in this confusion were the people. But then it must be

observed, that the multitude that came out of the country

were at discord before the Jerusalem sedition began; for

Titus went from Gischala to Caesarea, and Vespasian from

Caesarea to Jamnia and Azotus, and took them both; and

when he had put garrisons into them he came back with a

great number of the people, who were come over to him,
