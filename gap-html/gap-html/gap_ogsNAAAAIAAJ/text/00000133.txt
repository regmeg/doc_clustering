c. vii.] placidus. 127

But Placidus, relying much upon his horsemen and his former

good success, followed them, and slew all that he overtook,

as far as Jordan; and when he had driven the whole multitude

to the river-side, where they were stopped by the current

(for it had been augmented lately by rains, and was not

fordable,) he put his soldiers in array over against them ; so

the necessity the others were in provoked them to hazard a

battle, because there was no place whither they could flee.

They then extended themselves a very great way along the

banks of the river, and sustained the darts that were thrown

at them, as well as the attacks of the horsemen, who beat

many of them, and pushed them into the current. At which

fight, hand to hand, fifteen thousand of them were slain,

while the number of those that were unwillingly forced to

leap into Jordan was prodigious. There were besides two

thousand and two hundred taken prisoners. A mighty prey

was taken also, consisting of asses, and sheep, and camels,

and oxen.

6. Now this destruction that fell upon the Jews, as it was

not inferior to any of the rest in itself, so did it still appear

greater than it really was : and this because not only the

whole country through which they fled was filled with slaugh­

ter, and Jordan could not be passed over by reason of the

dead bodies that were in it, but because the lake Asphaltitis

was also full of dead bodies, that were carried down into it

by the river. And now Placidus, after this good success that

he had had, fell violently upon the neighboring smaller cities

and villages; when he took Abila, and Julias, and Bezemoth,

and all those that lay as far as the lake Asphaltitis, and put

such of the deserters into each of them as he thought proper.

He then put his soldiers on board the ships, and slew such as

had fled to the lake, insomuch that all Perea had either sur­

rendered themselves, or were taken by the Romans, as far as

Macherus.
