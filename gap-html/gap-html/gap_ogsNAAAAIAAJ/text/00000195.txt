C. VI.] NICANOR WOUNDED. 180

at the first onset the Romans made upon them, this lasted

but awhile; for they returned to their former madness, and

separated one from another, and fought it out, and did every

thing that the besiegers could desire them to do; for they

never suffered any thing that was worse from the Romans

than they made each other suffer; nor was there any misery

endured by the city, after these men's actions, that could be

for there it was that the first fortification was lower, and the

second was not joined to it, the builders neglecting to build

the wall strong where the new city was not much inhabited:

hero also was an easy passage to the third wall, through

which he thought to take the upper city, and, through the

tower of Antonia, the temple itself. But, at this time, as ho

was going round about the city, one of his friends, whose

name was JVicanor, was wounded with a dart on his left

shoulder, as he approached, together with Josephus, too near

the wall, and attempted to discourse to those that were upon

the wall about terms of peace; for he was a person known

by them. On this account it was that Cuesar, as soon as he

knew their vehemence that they would not bear even such as
