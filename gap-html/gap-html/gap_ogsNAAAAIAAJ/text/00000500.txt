name of the Lord." If, therefore, this shortening or taking

away the lives of men be no objection against any divine

command for that purpose, it is full as strong against the

present system of the world, against the conduct of divine

providence in general, and against natural religion, which is

founded on the justice of that providence, and is no way pe­

culiar to revealed religion, or to the fact of Abraham now

before us : nor is this case much different from what was soon

after the days of Abraham thoroughly settled, after Job's and

his friend's debates, by the inspiration of Alihu, and the de­

termination of God himself, where the divine providence was

at length thoroughly cleared and justified before all the world,

as it will be, no question, more generally cleared and justified

at the final judgment.

3. That, till this profane age, it has also, I think, been

universally allowed by all sober men, that a command of God,

when sufficiently made known to be so, is abundant authority

for the taking away the life of any person whomsoever. I

to deny this authority directly; they rather take a method of

objecting somewhat more plausible, though it amount to much

the same : they say, that the apparent disagreement of any

command to the moral attributes of God, such as this of the

slaughter of an only child seems plainly to be, will be a

greater evidence that such a command does not come from

God, than any pretended revelation can be that it does. But

as to this matter, although divine revelations have so long

ceased, that we are not well acquainted with the manner of

conveying such revelations with certainty to men, and by

consequence the apparent disagreement of a command with

the moral attributes of God ought at present, generally, if

not constantly, to deter men from acting upon such a pre­

tended revelation, yet was there no such uncertainty in the

days of the old prophets of God, or of Abraham, the friend
