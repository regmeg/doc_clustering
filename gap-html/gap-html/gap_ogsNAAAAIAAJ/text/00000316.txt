310 PETITION OF THE ANTIOCHIANS. [B. VII.

but a multitude of women also, with their children, did the

same, and when they saw him coming up to them, they stood

on both sides of the way, and stretched out their right hands,

saluting him, and making all sorts of acclamations to him,

and turned back together with him. They also, among all

the acclamations they made to him, besought him all the way

but permitted the Jews of Antioch to continue to enjoy the

very same privileges in that city which they had before, and

then departed for Egypt; and as he came to Jerusalem in

his progress, and compared the melancholy condition he saw

it then in with the ancient glory of the city, and called to

mind the greatness of its present ruins, as well as its ancient

splendor, he could not but pity the destruction of the city, so
