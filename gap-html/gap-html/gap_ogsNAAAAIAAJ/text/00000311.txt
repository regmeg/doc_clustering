C. IV.] VESPASIAN'S RECEPTION AT ROME. 305

joicing and pleasures to a great degree, as now freed from

the solicitude he had been under, after the most agreeable

manner. For all men that were in Italy showed their re­

spects to him in their minds before he came thither, as if he

had of him to be his real presence, on account of the great
