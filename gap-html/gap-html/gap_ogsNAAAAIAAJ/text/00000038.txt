82 VESPASIAN. [B. III.

cause every body would undertake any paius with great cheer­

fulness on his account; and in that case there would be some

comfort for them also, though they should be taken: that it

became him neither to fly from his enemies, not to desert his

friends, nor to leap out of that city, as out of a ship that was

sinking in a storm, into which he came when it was quiet and

in a calm; for that by going away ho would be the cause of

drowning the city, because nobody would then venture to

oppose the enemy when he was once gone, upon whom they

wholly confided.

was to go away to provide for his own safety, but told them

that " he would go out of the city for their sakes ; for that if

deliverance, but that thev hoped for their own; for they could

not think they should suffer any great misfortune, provided

Josephus would but stay with them.

would be ascribed to their entreaties, and if he resolved to go
