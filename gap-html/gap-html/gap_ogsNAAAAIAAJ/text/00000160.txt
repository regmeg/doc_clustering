154 TITUS AT JERUSALEM. [b. IV-

polis, which is distant twenty furlongs from Alexandria:

there he put his army on board some long ships, and sailed

upon the river along the Mendesian Nomus, as far as tho

city Thmuis: there he got out of the ships, and walked on

foot, and lodged all night at a small city called Tunis. His

second station was Heracleopolis, and his third Pclusium ; he

then refreshed his army at that place for two days, and on

the third passed over the mouths of Nile at Pelusium; he

then proceeded one station over the desert, and pitched his

camp at the temple of the Casian Jupiter,1 and on the next

day at Ostracine. This station had no water, but the people

of the country make use of water brought from other places.

After this he rested at Rhinocolura, and from thence he went

to Raphia, which was his fourth station. This city is the

beginning of Syria. For his fifth station he pitched his camp

at Gaza; after which he came to Ascalon, and thence to

Jamnia, and after that to Joppa, and from Joppa to Caesarea,

having taken a resolution to gather all his other forces toge­

ther at that place.

1 There are coins of this Casian Jupiter still extant, as Spanheim here in­

forms us.
