C.III.] JEWS SLAIN BY TITUS. 301

to escape it, on account of their not being punished imme­

diately.1 Simon was mado sensible of this by falling under

the indignation of the Romans. This rise of his out of the

ground did also occasion the discovery of a great number of

others of the seditious at that time, who had hidden them­

selves under ground. But for Simon, ho was brought to Ciesar

in bonds, when he was come back to that Coesarea which was

on the sea-side, who gave order that he should be kept against

that triumph which he was to celebrate at Rome upon this

occasion.

CHAPTER III.

HOW TITUS, UPON THE CELEBRATION OF niS BROTHER'S AND

FATHER'S BIRTH-DAYS, HAD MANY OF THE JEWS SLAIN. CON­

CERNING THE DANGER TnE JEWS WERE IN AT AXTIOCH BY

MEANS OF THE TRANGRESSION AND IMPIETY OF ONE ANTIO-

cnus A JEW.

§ 1. Whtle Titus was at Cresarea, he solemnized the birth­

day of his brother [Domitian] after a splendid manner, and

inflicted a great deal of the punishment intended for the Jews

in honor of him ; for the number of those that were now slain

in fighting with the beasts, and were burnt, and fought with

one another, exceeded two thousand five hundred. Yet did

all this seem to the Romans, when they were thus destroyed

ten thousand several ways, to be a punishment beneath their

deserts. After this, Caesar came to Berytus,2 which is a city

of Phoenicia, and a Roman colony, and stayed there a longer

time, and exhibited a still more pompous solemnity about his

father's birth-day, both in the magnificence of the shows, and

in the other vast expenses he was at in his devices thereto

belonging; so that a great multitude of the captives were here

destroyed after the same manner as before.

1 See Eccles. viii. 11.

' This Berytus was certainly a Roman colony, and has coins extant that

witness the same, as Hudson and Spanheim inform us. See the noto on

Antiq. B. in. oh. xi. sect. 1.
