B. II.] AGAINST APION. 455

enemies to injustice: they take care of righteousness : they

banish idleness and expensive living, and instruct men to be

content with what they have, and to be laborious in their

callings: they forbid men to make war from a desire of

getting more, but make men courageous in defending the

laws: they are inexorable in punishing malefactors: they

admit no sophistry of words, but are always established by

actions themselves, which actions we ever propose as surer

demonstrations than what is contained in writing only; on

which account I am so bold as to say, that we are become

the teachers of other men in the greatest number of things,

and those of the most excellent nature only: for what is more

excellent than inviolable piety ? what is more just than subÂ­

mission to laws ? and what is more advantageous than mutual

love and concord ? And this so far, that we are neither to

be divided by calamities, nor to become injurious and seditious -

in prosperity; but to contemn death when we are in war, and

in peace to apply ourselves to our mechanical occupations,

or to our tillage of the ground; while we in all things and

always are satisfied that God is the inspector and governor

of our actions. If these precepts had either been written at

first, or more exactly kept by any others before us, we should

have owed them thanks as disciples owe to their masters:

but if it be visible that we have made use of them more than

any other men, and if we have demonstrated that the original

invention of them is our own let the Apions, and the Molons,

with all the rest of those that delight in lies and reproaches,

stand confuted; but let this and the foregoing book bo

dedicated to thee, Epaphroditus, who art so great a lover of

truth, and by thy means to those that have been in like

manner desirous to be acquainted with the affairs of our

nation.
