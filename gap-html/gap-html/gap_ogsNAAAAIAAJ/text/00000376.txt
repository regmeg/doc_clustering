kings, but on the contrary denotes captive shepherds, and

tins on account of the particle Hyc ; for that Hyc, with the

aspiration, in the Egyptian tongue, again denotes shepherds,

and that expressly also: and this to me seems the more

probable opinion, and more agreeable to ancient history.

[But Manetho goes on] — " These people, whom we have be­

fore named kings, and called shepherds also, and their descen­

dants," as he says, "kept possession of Egypt five hundred

and eleven years. After these," he says,—" That the kings

of Thebais and of the other parts of Egypt, made an insurrec­

war was made between them." He says farther,—" That

under a king, whose name was Alisphragmuthosis, the shep­

herds were subdued by him, and were, indeed, driven out of

other parts of Egypt, but were shut up in a place that con­

Manetho says,—" That the shepherds built a wall round all

this place, which was a large and a strong wall, and this in

order to keep all their possessions and their prey within a

place of strength, but that Thummosis, the son of Alisphrag­

muthosis, made an attempt to take them by force and by

siege, with four hundred and eighty thousand men to lie

round about them ; but that, upon his despair of taking the

place by that siege, they came to a composition with them,

that they should leave Egypt, and go, without any harm to

be done to them, whithersoever they would; and that after

this composition was made, they went away with their whole

families and effects, not fewer in number than two hundred

and forty thousand, and took their journey from Egypt

through the wilderness for Syria; but that, as they were in

fear of the Assyrians, who had then the dominion over Asia,

they built a city in that country which is now called Judea,

and that large enough to contain this great " number of men,

and called it Jerusalem."' Now Manetho, in another book

of his, says,—" That this nation, thus called shepherds, were

according to Manetho, when the Phoenician shepherds were expelled out of

Egypt, about thirty-seven years before Abraham eamo out of llaran.
