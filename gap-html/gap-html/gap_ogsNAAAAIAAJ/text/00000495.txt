DISSERTATION I. 489

but must leave them in suspense, for the farther consideration

of the learned.

X. As to that great critic, Photius, in the ninth century,

who is supposed not to have had this testimony in his copy

of Josephus, or else to have esteemed it spurious, because in

his extracts out of Josephus's Antiquities it is not expressly

mentioned; this is a strange thing indeed! that a section

which had been cited out of Josephus's copies all along

before the days of Photius, as well as it has been all along

cited out of them since his days, should be supposed not to

he in his copy, because he does not directly mention it in

certain short and imperfect extracts, no way particularly

relating to such matters. Those who lay a stress on this

silence of Photius seem little to have attended to the nature

and brevity of those extracts. They contain little or nothing,

as he in effect professes at their entrance, but what concerns

Antipater, Herod the Great, and his brethren and family,

with their exploits, till the days of Agrippa^wn. and Cumanus,

the governor of Judea, fifteen years after the death of our

Saviour, without one word of Pilate, or what happened under

his government, which yet was the only proper place in

which this testimony could come to be mentioned. However,

since Photius seems, therefore, as we have seen, to suspect

the treatise ascribed by some to Josephus, of the Universe,

because it speaks very high things of the eternal generation

and divinity of Christ, this looks very like his knowledge

and belief of somewhat really in the same Josephus, which

spake in a lower manner of him, which could be hardly any

other passage than this testimony before us. And since, as

we have also seen, when he speaks of the Jewish history of

Justus of Tiberias, as infected with the prejudices of the Jews,

in taking no manner of notice of the advent, of the acts, and

of the miracles of Jesus Christ, while yet he never speaks

so of Josephus himself, this most naturally implies also, that

there was not the like occasion here as there, but that JoseÂ­

phus had not wholly omitted that advent, those acts, or

miracles, which yet he has done everywhere else, in the books
