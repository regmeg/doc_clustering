C. IV.] JERUSALEM. 175

Now that wall began on the north, at the tower called Eip-

picus, and extended as far as the Xistus, a place so called,

and then joining to the council-house, ended at the west

cloister of the temple. But if we go the other way westward,

it began at the same place, and extended through a place

called Bethso to the gate of the Essens; and after that it

went southward, having its bending above the fountain Siloam,

where it also bends again towards the east at Solomon's pool,

and reaches as far as a certain place which they called

Ophlas, where it was joined to the eastern cloister of the

temple. The second wall took its beginning from that gate

which they called Gennath, which belonged to the first wall;

it only encompassed the northern quarter of the city, and

reached as far as the tower Antonia. The beginning of tho

third wall was at the tower Hippicus, whence it reached as far

as the north quarter of the city and the tower Psephinus, and

then was so far extended till it came over against the monu­

ments of Helens, which Helena was queen of Adiabene, the

daughter of Izates; it then extended farther to a great length,

and passed by the sepulehral caverns of the kings, and bent

again at the tower of the corner, at the monument which is

called the Monument of the Fuller, and joined to the wall at

the valley called the Valley of Cedron. It was Agrippa who

encompassed the parts added to the old city with this wall,

which had been all naked before; for as the city grew more

populous, it gradually crept beyond its old limits; and those

parts of it that-stood northward of the temple, and joined

that hill to the city, made it considerably larger, and occa­

sioned that hill, which is in number the fourth, and is called

Bezetha, to be inhabited also. It lies over against the tower

Antonia, but is divided from it by a deep valley, which was

dug on purpose, and that in order to hinder the foundations

of the tower of Antonia from joining to this hill, and thereby

affording an opportunity for getting to it with ease, and hin­

dering the security that arose from its superior elevation; for

which reason also that depth of the ditch made the elevation

of the towers more remarkable. This new-built part of the

city was called Bezetha, in our language, which, if interpreted
