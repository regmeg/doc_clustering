B.I.] AGAINST APION. 379

in that history which he composed, where he mentions the

siege of Tyre; as does Megasthenes also, in the fourth book

of his Indian history, wherein he pretends to prove that the

forementioned king of the Babylonians was superior to Her­

cules in strength and the greatness of his exploits, for he says

that he conquered a great part of Libya, and conquered Iberia
