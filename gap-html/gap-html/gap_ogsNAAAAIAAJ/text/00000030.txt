2-1 VESPASIAN. [B. III.

3. And thus did Vespasian march with his army, and came

to the bounds of Galilee, where he pitehed his camp, and re­

strained his soldiers, who were eager for war: he also showed

his army to the enemy, in order to affright them, and to afford

them a season for repentance, to see whether they would

change their minds before it came to a battle, and at the

same time he got things ready for besieging their strong­

holds. And, indeed, this sight of the general brought many

to repent of the revolt, and put them all into a consternation:

for those that were in Josephus's camp, which was at the city

called Garis, not far from Sepphoris, when they heard that

the war was come near them, and that the Romans would

suddenly fight them hand to hand, dispersed themselves, and

fled not only before they came to a battle, but before the

enemy ever came in sight, while Josephus and a few others

were left behind; and as he saw that he had not an army

sufficient to engage the enemy, that the spirits of the Jews

Were sunk, and that the greater part would willingly come to

terms, if they might be credited, he already despaired of the

success of the whole war, and determined to get as far as he

possibly could out of danger; so he took those that stayed

along with him, and fled to Tiberias.

CHAPTER VII.

VESPASIAN, WHEN HE HAD TAKEN THE CITY GADARA, MARCHES

TO JOTAPATA : AFTER A LONG SIEGE, THE CITY IS BETRAYED

BY A DESERTER, AND TAKEN BY VESPASIAN.

§ 1. So Vespasian marched to the city Gadara, and took

it upon the first onset, because he found it destitute of any

considerable number of men grown up and fit for war. Ho

then came into it, and slew all the youth, the Romans having

no mercy on any age whatsoever; and this was done out of

the hatred they bore the nation, and because of the iniquity

they had been guilty of in the affair of Cestius. He also set

fire not only to the city itself, but to all the villas and small
