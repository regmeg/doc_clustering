116 DEFECTION OF THE IDUMEANS. [B. IV.

no indication of any such treachery; but that they bad suc­

cored those that had pretended to believe such a thing, while

they did themselves the works of war and tyranny after an

insolent manner. It had been, indeed, their business to have

hindered them from such their proceedings at the first; but

seeing they had once been partners with them in shedding the

blood of their own countrymen, it was high time to put a stop

to such crimes, and not continue to afford any more assistance

to such as arc subverting the laws of their forefathers; for

that if any had taken it ill that the gates had been shut against

them, and they had not been permitted to come into the city,

yet that those who had excluded them have been punished,

and Ananus is dead, and that almost all those people had been

destroyed in one night's time: that one may perceive many

of themselves now repenting for what they had done, and

might see the horrid barbarity of those that had invited them;

and that they had no regard to such as had saved them : that

they were so impudent as to perpetrate the vilest things under

the eyes of those that had supported them; and that their

wicked actions would be laid to the charge of the Idumeans,

and would be so laid to their charge till somebody obstructs

their proceedings, or separates himself from the same wicked

action: that they, therefore, ought to retire home, since the

imputation of treason appears to be a calumny, and that there

was no expectation of the coming of the Romans at this time,

and that the government of the city was secured by such walls

as cannot easily be thrown down, and, by avoiding any farther

fellowship with these bad men, to make some excuse for them­

selves, as to what they had been so far deluded as to have

been partners with them hitherto."
