what great diligence they should use in their occupations,

and what times of rest should be interposed; that, by living

under that law as under a father and a master, we might be

guilty of no sin, neither voluntary nor out of ignorance; for

he did not suffer the guilt of ignorance to go on without

punishment, but demonstrated the law to be the best and the

most necessary instruction of all others, permitting the people

to leave off their other employments, and to assemble together

people but the Jews have avoided all discourses about God

that any way contradict one another, which yet are frequent

among other nations; and this is true not only among ordi足
