C. I.] SIEGE OF GAMALA. 81

himself came to his assistance against those that had fled to

the citadel, and brought his whole army with him : now this

upper part of the city was every way rocky and difficult of

ascent, and elevated to a vast altitude, and very full of peo足

ple on all sides, and encompassed with precipices, whereby

the Jews cut off those that came up to them, and did much

mischief to others by their darts and the large stones which

they rolled down upon them, while they were themselves so

high that the enemy's darts could hardly reach them. How足

ever, there arose such a divine storm against them as was

instrumental to their destruction : this carried the Roman

darts upon them, and made those which they threw return

back, and drove them obliquely away from them; nor could

the Jews, indeed, stand upon their precipices, by reason of

the violence of the wind, having nothing that was stable to

stand upon, nor could they see those that were ascending up

to them: so the Romans got up and surrounded them, and

some they slew before they could defend themselves, and

others as they were delivering up themselves; and the re足

membrance of those that were slain at their former entrance

into the city increased their rage against them now: a great

number also of those that were surrounded on every side,

and despaired of escaping, threw their children and their

wives, and themselves also, down the precipices to the valley

beneath, which near the citadel had been dug hollow to a vast

depth; but so it happened, that the anger of the Romans

appeared not to be so extravagant as was the madness of

those that were now taken, while the Romans slew but four

thousand, whereas the number of those that had thrown them足

selves down was found to be five thousand: nor did any one

escape except two women, who were the daughters of Philip,

and Philip himself was the son of a certain eminent man

called Jacimus, who had been general of king Agrippa's

army ; and these did, therefore, escape, because they lay

conoealed from the rage of the Romans when the city was

taken ; for otherwise they spared not so much as the infants,

of which many were flung down by them from the citadel.

And thus was Gamala taken, on the three and twentieth day
