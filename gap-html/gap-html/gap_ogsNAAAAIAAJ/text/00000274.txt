268 THE TEMPLE -* [u. VI.

But as for that house, God had for certain long ago doomed

it to the fire; and now that fatal day was come, according to

the revolution of ages; it was the tenth day of the month

Lous [Ab,] upon which it was formerly burnt by the king of

Babylon: although these flames took their rise from the Jews

themselves, and were occasioned by them: for upon Titus's

retiring, the seditious lay still for a little while, and then at足

so there was a great clamor and tumult raised, as was natural

upon the disorderly motion of so great an army. Then did

Caesar, both by calling to the soldiers that were fighting with

a loud voice and by giving a signal to them with his right

hand, order them to quench the fire. But they did not hear

what he said, though he spake so loud, having their ears al足
