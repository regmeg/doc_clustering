of the waves." Now, if the place of habitation includes any

thing that is reproachful, this man reproaches not his own

real country [Egypt,] but what he pretends to be his own

country, Alexandria; for all are agreed in this, that the part

of that city which is near the sea is the best part of all for

habitation. Now, if the Jews gained that part of the city by

force, and have kept it hitherto without impeachment, this is

a mark of their valor : but in reality it was Alexander him­

self that gave them that place for their habitation, when they

obtained equal privileges there with the Macedonians. Nor

can I devise what Apion would have said, had their habita­

tion been at Necropolis,1 and not been fixed hard by the royal

palace [as it is ;] nor had their nation had the denomination

of Macedonians given them till this very day [as they have.]

Had this man now read the epistles of King Alexander, or

those of Ptolemy, the son of Lagus, or met with the writings

of the succeeding kings, or that pillar which is still standing

at Alexandria, and contains the privileges which the great

[Julius] Caesar bestowed upon the Jews; had this man, I say,

known these records, and yet hath the impudence to write in

contradiction to them, he hath shown himself to be a wicked

man : but if he knew nothing of these records, he hath shown

himself to be a man very ignorant: nay, when he appears to

wonder how Jews could be called Alexandrians, this is an­

other like instance of his ignorance: for all such as are called

out to be colonies, although they be ever so far remote from

one another in their original, receive their names from those

that bring them to their new habitations. And what occasion

is there to speak of others, when those of us Jews that dwelt

at Antioch are named Antiochiam, because Seleucus, the

founder of that city, gave them the privileges belonging

thereto ? After the like manner, do those Jews that inhabit

Epheius and the other cities of Ionia enjoy the same name

with those that were originally bom there, by the grant of the

succeeding princes: nay, the kindness and humanity of the

Romans hath been so great that it hath granted leave to almost

all others to take the same name of Romans upon them; I
