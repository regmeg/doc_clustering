190 TITUS PRESSES THE SIEGE. [B. V".

reproached them to persuade them to what tended to their

own preservation, was provoked to press on the siege. He

also, at the same time, gave his soldiers leave to set the

suburbs on fire, and ordered that they should bring timber

together, and raise banks against the city; and when he had

parted his army into three parts, in order to set about those

which they got when they seized the garrison that lay in the

tower Antonia. But though they had these engines in their

possession, they had so little skill in using them, that they

were in a great measure useless to them; but a few there

were who had been taught by deserters how to use them,

which they did use, though after an awkward manner. So

they cast stones and arrows at those that were making the

banks; they also ran out upon them by companies, and fought

with them. Now, those that were at work covered themÂ­

selves with hurdles spread over their banks, and their engines
