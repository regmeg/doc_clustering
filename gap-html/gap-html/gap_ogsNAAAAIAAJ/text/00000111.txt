CIV.] COME TO JERUSALEM. 105

families that are in black mourning for their slaughtered re­

lations ; as also, you may hear their groans and lamentations

all the city over ; for there is nobody but hath tasted of the

incursions of these profane wretches, who have proceeded to

that degree of madness, as not only to have transferred their

impudent robberies out of the country and the remote cities

into this city, the very face and head of the whole nation,

but out of the city into the temple also; for that, is now made

their receptacle and refuge, and the fountain-head whence

such as had no accusations laid against them to speak a word

for themselves. However, let them gain this advantage by

your coming. But still, if you will neither take our part in

that indignation we have at these men, nor judge between us,

the third thing I have to propose is this, that you let us both

alone, and neither insult upon our calamities, nor abide with

these plotters against their metropolis: for though you should

have ever so great a suspicion that some of us have discoursed
