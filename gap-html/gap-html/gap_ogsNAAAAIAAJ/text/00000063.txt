attacked, and were afraid of it; yet did they not endeavor

to keep the Romans out, but fled to their ships, and lay at

sea all night out of the reach of their darts.

3. Now Joppa is not naturally a haven, for it ends in a

rough shore, where all the rest of it is straight, but the two ends,

bend towards each other, where there are deep precipices, and

great stones that jet out into the sea, and where the chains

wherewith Andromeda was bound have left their footsteps,

which attest to the antiquity of that fable. But the north

wind opposes and beats upon the shore, and dashes mighty

waves against the rocks which receive them, and renders the

haven more dangerous than the country they had deserted.

Now as these people of Joppa were floating about in this

sea, in the morning there fell a violent wind upon them; it

is called by those that sail there the black north wind, and

there dashed their ships one against another, and dashed

some of them against the rocks, and carried many of them

by force, while they strove against the opposite waves, into

the main sea; for the shore was so rocky, and had so many

of the enemy upon it, that they were afraid to come to land;

nay, the waves rose so very high that they drowned them :

nor was there any place whither they could fly, nor any way

to save themselves: while they were thrust out of the sea,

by the violence of the wind, if they stayed where they were,

and out of the city by the violence of the Romans; and

much lamentation there was when the ships were dashed

against one another, and a terrible noise when they were

broken to pieces; and some of the multitude that were in

them were covered with the waves, and so perished, and a

great many were embarrassed with shipwrecks ; but some of

them thought, that to die by their own swords was lighter

than by the sea, and so they killed themselves before they

were drowned; although the greatest part of them were

carried by the waves, and dashed to pieces against the abrupt

parts of the rocks, insomuch that the sea was bloody a long

way, and the maritime parts were full of dead bodies; for

the Romans came upon those that were carried to the shore,

and destroyed them; and the number of the bodies that were
