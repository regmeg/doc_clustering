C. IX.] SIMON AND JOHN. 293

two hundred fifty-six thousand and five hundred, which, upon

the allowance of no more than ten that feast togother,

amounts to two millions seven hundred thousand and two

hundred persons that were pure and holy; for as to those

that have the leprosy or the gonorrhoea, or women that have

their monthly courses, or such as are otherwise polluted, it is

not lawful for them to be partakers of this sacrifice; nor,

indeed, for any foreigners neither, who come hither to worship.

4. Now this vast multitude is, indeed, collected out of

remote places; but the entire nation was now shut up by

fate, as in a prison, and the Roman army encompassed the

city when it was crowded with inhabitants. Accordingly,

the multitude of those that therein perished exceeded all the

destructions that either men or God ever brought upon the

world: for to speak only of what was publicly known, the

Romans slew some of them, some they carried captives, and

others they made a search for under ground, and when they

found where they were, they broke up the ground, and slew

all they met with. There were also found slain there above

two thousand persons, partly by their own hands and partly

by one another, but chiefly destroyed by the famine : but then

the ill-savor of the dead bodies was most offensive to those

that lighted upon them, insomuch that some were obliged to

get away immediately, while others were so greedy of gain,

that they would go in among the dead bodies that lay on

heaps, and tread upon them ; for a great deal of treasure

was found in these caverns, and the hope of gain made every

way of getting it to be esteemed lawful. Many also of those

that had been put in prison by the tyrants were now brought

out; for they did not leave off their barbarous cruelty at the

very last: yet did God avenge himself upon them both, in a

manner agreeable to justice. As for John, he wanted food,

together with his brethren, in these caverns, and begged that

the Romans would now give him their right hand for his

security, which he had often proudly rejected before ; but for

Simon, he struggled hard with the distress he was in, till he

was forced to surrender himself, as we shall relate hereafter;
