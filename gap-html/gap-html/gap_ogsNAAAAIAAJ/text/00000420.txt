414 FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS [b. II.

great desire of knowing our laws and of obtaining the books

of our sacred scriptures: accordingly, he desired that such

men might be sent him as might interpret our law to him;

and in order to have them well compiled, he committed that

care to no ordinary persons, but ordained that Demetrius

Phalereus, and Andreas, and Aristeas; the first, Demetrius,

the most learned person of his age, and the others such as

were intrusted with the guard of his body, should take the

care of this matter: nor would he certainly have been so desi­

rous of learning our law and the philosophy of our nation,

had he despised the men that made use of it, or had he not,

kings of those Macedonians whom he pretends to have been

his progenitors; who were yet very well affected towards us:

whole army. But certainly, instead of reproaching them, he

ought to admire their actions, and return them thanks for

saving Alexandria, whose citizen he pretends to be : for when

these Alexandrians were making war with Cleopatra the queen,

and were in danger of being utterly ruined, these Jews brought

them to terms of agreement, and freed them from the miseries

of a civil war. " But then," says Apion, " Onias brought a

small army afterward upon the city, at the .time when Ther-

mus the lloman ambassador was there present." Yes, do I

venture to say, and that he did rightly and very justly in so

doing; for that Ptolemy who was called Physco, upon the

death of his brother Philometor, came from Cyrene, and would

have ejected Cleopatra as well as her sons out of their king­
