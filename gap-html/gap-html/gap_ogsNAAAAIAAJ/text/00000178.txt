172 TITUS THREATENS HIS S0LDIEK8. [B. V

gave them as many blows again, and at last repelled those

that had encompassed them about, while the Jews pursued

them as they retired, and followed them, and threw darts at

them as far as the monuments of Queen Helen.

4. After this, these Jews, without keeping any decorum,

grew insolent upon their good fortune, and jested upon the

Romans for being deluded by the trick they had put upon

them, and making a noise with beating their shields, leaped

for gladness, and made joyful exclamations ; while these sol­

at this time they have seen an entire army run into disorder.

However, those that have been so insolent shall be made im­

Romans without orders for fighting, are to be under disgrace."

When Titus had enlarged upon this matter before the com­

manders, it appeared evident that he would execute the law

against all those that were concerned ; so these soldiers' minds

sunk down in despair, as expecting to be put to death, and

that justly and quickly. However, the other legions camo

round about Titus, and entreated his favor to these their fel­
