BOOK V.

CONTAINING

THE INTERVAL OF NEAR SIX MONTHS.

FROM THE COMING OF TITUS TO BESIEGE JERUSALEM TO THE

GREAT EXTREMITY TO WHICH THE JEWS WERE REDUCED.

CHAPTER I.

CONCERNING THE SEDITIONS AT JERUSALEM, AND WHAT TERRI­

BLE MISERIES AFFLICTED THE CITY BY THEIR MEANS.

§ 1. When, therefore, Titus had marched over that desert

which lies between Egypt and Syria, in the manner foremen-

tioned, he came to Caesarea, having resolved to set his forces

in order at that place before he began the war. Nay, indeed,

while he was assisting his father at Alexandria in settling that

government which had been newly conferred upon them by

God, it so happened, that the sedition at Jerusalem was re­

vived, and parted into three factions; and that one faction

fought against the other, which partition in such evil cases

may be said to be a good thing, and the effect of divine jus­

tice. Now, as to the attack the zealots made upon the people,

and which I esteem the beginning of the city's destruction, it

hath been already explained after an accurate manner; as

also whence it arose, and to how great a mischief it was in­

creased. But, for the present sedition, one should not mis­

take if he called it a sedition begotten by another sedition,

and to be like a wild beast grown mad, which for want of

food from abroad, fell now upon eating its own flesh.
