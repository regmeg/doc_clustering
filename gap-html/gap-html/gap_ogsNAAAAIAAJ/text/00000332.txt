326 THE ALANS. [B. VII.

formerly mentioned1 somewhere as being Scythians, and in足

habiting at the lake Mcotis. This nation about this time laid

a design of falling upon Media, and the parts beyond it, in

order to plunder them ; with which intention they treated with

the king of Hyrcania, for he was master of that passage which

King Alexander [the Great] shut up with iron gates. This

king gave them leave to come through them: so they came

in great multitudes, and fell upon the Medes unexpectedly,

and plundered their country, which they found full of people,

and replenished with abundance of cattle; while nobody durst

make any resistance against them; for Pacorus, the king of

the country, had fled away for fear into places where they

could not easily come at him, and had yielded up every thing

he had to them, and had only saved his wife and his concu足

bines from them, and that with difficulty also, after they had

been made captives, by giving them an hundred talents for

their ransom. These Alans, therefore, plundered the country

without opposition, and with great ease, and proceeded as far

as Armenia, laying all waste before them. Now Tridates was

king of that country, who met them, and fought them, but

had like to have been taken alive in the battle ; for a certain

man threw a net over him from a great distance, and had soon

drawn him to him, unless he had immediately cut the cord

with his sword, and ran away, and prevented it. So the Alans

being still more provoked by this fight, laid waste the coun足

try, and drove a great multitude of the men, and a great

quantity of the other prey they had gotten out of both king足

doms, along with them, and then retreated back to their own

country.
