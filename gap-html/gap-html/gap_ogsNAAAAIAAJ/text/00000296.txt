with these men's blood. And truly so it happened, that

though the slayers left off at the evening, yet did the fire

greatly prevail in the night; and as all was burning, came

that eighth day of the month Gorpieus [Elul,] upon Jerusa­

lem, a city that had been liable to so many miseries during

this siege, that had it always enjoyed as much happiness from

its first foundation, it would certainly have been the envy of

the world. Nor did it, on any other account, so much deserve

these sore misfortunes, as by producing such a generation of

men as were the occasion of this its overthrow.

THAT HAD ESCAPED INTO THE SUBTERRANEAN CAVERNS,

§ 1. Now, when Titus was come into this [upper] city, he

admired not only some other places of strength in it, but

particularly those strong towers which the tyrants, in their

mad conduct, had relinquished: for when he saw their solid

altitude, and the largeness of their several stones, and the

exactness of their joints, as also how great was their breadth,

and how extensive their length, he expressed himself after

the manner following: — "We have certainly had God for

our assistant in this war, and it was no other than God who

ejected the Jews out of these fortifications; for what could

the hands of men or any machines do towards overthrowing

these towers?" At which time he had many such discourses

to his friends: he also let such go free as had been bound by

the tyrants, and were left in the prisons. To conclude, when

he had entirely demolished the rest of the city, and overthrew

its walls, he left these towers as a monument of his good

fortune, which had proved his auxiliaries, and enabled him to

take what otherwise could not have been taken by him.
