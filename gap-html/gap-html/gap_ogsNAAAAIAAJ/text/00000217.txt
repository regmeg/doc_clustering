C. IX.] THE SIEGE. 211

your hands ! Did your king [Hezekiah] lift up such hands

in prayer to God against the king of Assyria, when he de­

stroyed that great army in one night ? And do the Romans

commit such wickedness, as did the king of Assyria, that you

may have reason to hope for the like vengeance upon them 1

Did not that king accept of money from our king on this con­

dition, that he should not destroy the city ? and yet contrary

to the oath he had taken, he came down to burn the temple ;

while the Romans do demand no more than that accustomed

tribute which our fathers paid to their fathers ; and if they

may but once obtain that, they neither aim to destroy this

city nor to touch this sanctuary; nay, they will grant you

besides, that your posterity shall be free, and your possessions

secured to you, and will preserve your holy laws inviolate to

you. And it is plain madness to expect that God should

appear as well disposed towards the wicked as towards the

righteous, since he knows when it is proper to punish men

for their sins immediately ; accordingly, he brake the power

of the Assyrians the very first night that they pitched their

camp. Wherefore, had he judged that our nation was

worthy of freedom, or the Romans of punishment, he had

immediately inflicted punishment upon those Romans, as he

did upon the Assyrians, when Pompey began to meddle with

our nation, or when, after him, Sosius came up against us, or

when Vespasian laid waste Galilee, or, lastly, when Titus

came first of all near to this city ; although Magnus and

Sosius did not only suffer nothing, but took the city by force ;

as did Vespasian go from the war he had made against you

to receive the empire; and as for Titus, those springs that

were formerly almost dried up' when they were under your

power, since he has come, run more plentifully than they

did before: accordingly, you know that Siloam, as well as

1 This drying up of the Jerusalem fountain of Siloam, when the Jews

wanted it, and its flowing abundantly when the enemies of the Jews wanted

it, and these both in the days of Zedekiah and of Titus, (and this last as a

certain event well known by the Jews at that time, as Josephus here tells

them openly to their faces,) are very remarkable instances of a divine Provi­

dence for the punishment of the Jewish nation when they were grown very

wicked, at both those times of the destruction of Jerusnlem.
