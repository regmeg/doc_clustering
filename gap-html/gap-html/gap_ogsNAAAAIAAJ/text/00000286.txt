280 speech of titus [b. VL

that tribute which is paid to God,1 with such other gifts that

are dedicated to him ; nor have we called those that carried

these donations to account, nor prohibited them; till at length

you became richer than we ourselves, even when you wero

with our money: nay, after all, when you were in the enjoy­

ashamed to raise disturbances against us when we were made

emperors, and this while you had experienced how mild we
