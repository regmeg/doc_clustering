B. I.] AGAINST APION. 405

and took counsel what they should do, and determined that,

as the night was coming on, they should kindle fires and

lamps, and keep watch : that they also should fast the next

night, and propitiate the gods, in order to obtain deliverance

from them : that on the next day there was one Moses, who

But if they were foreigners, why dost thou not tell us whence

they came ? And how could it be, that after the king had

drowned many of them in the sea, and ejected the rest into

desert places, there should be still so great a multitude reÂ­
