488 DISSERTATION I.

any one Jew but Josephus, who in a sort of compliance with

the Romans and the catholic Christians, who thought him a

God, would say any thing like his being a God.

(4.) How came Origen to affirm twice, so expressly, that

Josephus did not himself own, in the Jewish and Christian

sense, that Jesus was Christ, notwithstanding his quotations

of such eminent testimonies out of him for John the Baptist

his forerunner, and for James the Just his brother, and one

of his principal disciples? There is no passage in all Jose足

phus so likely to persuade Origen of this as is the famous

testimony before us, wherein, as he and all the ancients un足

derstood it, he was generally called Christ indeed, but not

any otherwise than as the common name whence the sect of

Christians was derived, and where he all along speaks of

those Christians as a sect then in being, whose author was a

wonderful person, and his followers great lovers of him and

of the truth, yet as such a sect as he had not joined himself

to ; which exposition, as it is a very natural one, so was it, I

doubt, but too true of our Josephus at that time; nor can I

devise any other reason but this, and the parallel language

of Josephus elsewhere, when he speaks of James as the bro足

ther, not of Jesus who was Christ, but of Jesus tvho was

called Christ, that could so naturally induce Origen and

others to be of that opinion.

IX. There are two remarkable passages iu Suidas and

Theophylact, already set down, as citing Josephus; the

former, that Jesus officiated with the priests ia the temple,

and the latter, that the destruction of Jerusalem, and miseries

of the Jews, were owing to their putting Jesus to death,

which arc in none of our present copies, nor cited thence by

any ancienter authors; nor, indeed, do they seem altogether

consistent with the other more authentic testimonies: how足

ever, since Suidas cites his passage from a treatise of Jose-

phus's called Memoirs of the Jews' Captivity, a book never

heard of elsewhere, and since both citations are not at all

disagreeable to Josephus's character as a Nazarene or

Ebionite. I dare not positively conclude they are spurious,
