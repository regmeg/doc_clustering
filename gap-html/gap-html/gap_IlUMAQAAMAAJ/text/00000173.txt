the victorious enemy. The conflict between the two xvx

lines of infantry was obstinate and bloody. The

Germans possessed the superiority of strength and

stature, the Romans that of discipline and temper;

and as the Barbarians, who served under the stand­

ard of the empire, united the respective advantages

of both parties, their strenuous efforts, guided by a

skilful leader, at length determined the event of the

day. The Romans lost four tribunes, and two hun­

salutary to the afflicted provinces of Gaul. Six

thousand of the Alemanni were slain in the field,

without including those who were drowned in the

Rhine, or transfixed with darts whilst they attempted

to swim across the river. Chnodomar himself was

surrounded and taken prisoner, with three of his

brave companions, who devoted themselves to follow

in life or death the fate of their chieftain. Julian

received him with military pomp in the council of

his officers; and expressing a generous pity for the

fallen state, dissembled his inward contempt for the

abject humiliation of his captive. Instead of ex­

hibiting the vanquished king of the Alemanni, as a

grateful spectacle to the cities of Gaul, he respect­

trophy of his victory. Chnodomar experienced an

honourable treatment, but the impatient Barbarian

and his exile *.
