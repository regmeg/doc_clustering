c^Ap, The character of the prince who removed the seat

of empire, and introduced such important changes

ofha>mtean- *nto tne an& religious constitution of his coun-

tine, try, has fixed the attention, and divided the opinions,

of mankind. By the grateful zeal of the Christians,

the deliverer of the church has been decorated with

every attribute of a hero, and even of a saint; while

the discontent of the vanquished party has com­

pared Constantine to the most abhorred of those

tyrants, who, by their vice and weakness, disho­

noured the Imperial purple. The same passions have

in some degree been perpetuated to succeeding ge­

nerations, and the character of Constantine is con­

sidered, even in the present age, as an object either

of satire or of panegyric. By the impartial union of

those defects which are confessed by his warmest ad­

mirers, and of those virtues which are acknowledged

by his most implacable enemies, we might hope to

delineate a just portrait of that extraordinary man,

which the truth and candour of history should adopt

without a blush. But it would soon appear, that

the vain attempt to blend such discordant colours,

and to reconcile such inconsistent qualities, must

produce a figure monstrous rather than human, un­

less it is viewed in its proper and distinct lights, by

a careful separation of the different periods of the

reign of Constantine.
