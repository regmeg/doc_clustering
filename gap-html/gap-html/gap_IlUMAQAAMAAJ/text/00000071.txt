hand, and in purple ink, the solemn edict, or in- XIV*

diction, which was fixed up in the principal city

of each diocese, during two months previous to the

first day of September. And, by a very easy con­

nexion of ideas, the word indiction was transferred to

the measure of tribute which it prescribed, and to

the annual term which it allowed for the payment.

This general estimate of the supplies was propor­

tioned to the real and imaginary wants of the state;

but as often as the expense exceeded the revenue, or

the revenue fell short of the computation, an addi­

imposed on the people, and the most valuable attri­

bute of sovereignty was communicated to the Prae­

torian praefects, who, on some occasions, were per­

mitted to provide for the unforeseen and extraor­

dinary exigencies of the public service. The execu­

tion of these laws (which it would be tedious to pur­

sue in their minute and intricate detail) consisted of

two distinct operations; the resolving the general

imposition into its constituent parts, which were as­

sessed on the provinces, the cities, and the indivi­

duals of the Roman world; and the collecting the

separate contributions of the individuals, the cities,

and the provinces, till the accumulated sums were

poured into the Imperial treasuries. But as the ac­

count between the monarch and the subject was per­

petually open, and as the renewal of the demand an­

ticipated the perfect discharge of the preceding obli­

moved by the same hands round the cirele of its

yearly revolution. Whatever was honourable or im­

portant in the administration of the revenue was

committed to the wisdom of the prefects, and their

provincial representatives; the lucrative functions

were claimed by a crowd of subordinate officers,
