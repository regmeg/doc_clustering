THE DECLINE AND FALL,

the scene of universal despair, which he seems to

have viewed with an eye of compassion. The mar­

tial youth deserted, with indignant grief, the walls

which they had so gloriously defended: the discon­

solate mourner dropt a last tear over the tomb of

a son or husband, which must soon be profaned by

the rude hand of a Barbarian master; and the aged

citizen kissed the threshold, and clung to the doors,

of the house, where he had passed the cheerful and

careless hours of infancy. The highways were crowded

with a trembling multitude: the distinctions of rank,

and sex, and age, were lost in the general calamity.

Every one strove to bear away some fragment from

the wreck of his fortunes; and as they could not

command the immediate service of an adequate num­

ber of horses or waggons, they were obliged to leave

behind them the greatest part of their valuable effects.

The savage insensibility of Jovian appears to have

aggravated the hardships of these unhappy fugitives;

They were seated, however, in a new-built quarter

of Amida; and that rising city, with the reinforce­

ment of a very considerable colony, soon recovered

its former splendour, and became the capital of Me­

sopotamia *. Similar orders were despatched by the

emperor for the evacuation of Singara and the castle

of the Moors; and for the restitution of the five

provinces beyond the Tigris. Sapor enjoyed the glory

and the fruits of his victory; and this ignominious

peace has justly been considered as a memorable aera

in the decline and fall of the Roman empire. The

predecessors of Jovian had sometimes' relinquished

the dominion of distant and unprofitable provinces;

but, since the foundation of the city, the genius of

Rome, the god Terminus, who guarded the bounda­

ries of the republic, had never retired before the

sword of a victorious enemy.
