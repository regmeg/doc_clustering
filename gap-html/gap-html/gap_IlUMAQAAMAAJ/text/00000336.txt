a. d. 364 committed the sceptre of the Roman empire to the

!/J' hands of Valentinian, his reputation in arms, his

military skill and experience, and his rigid attach­

ment to the forms, as well as spirit, of ancient dis­

cipline, were the principal motives of their judicious

choice. The eagerness of the troops, who pressed

him to nominate his colleague, was justified by the

dangerous situation of public affairs; and Valentinian

himself was conscious, that the abilities of the most

active mind were unequal to the defence of the di­

stant frontiers of an invaded monarchy. As soon as

the death of Julian had relieved the Barbarians from

the terror of his name, the most sanguine hopes

of rapine and conquest excited the nations of the

a. d. 364 East, of the North, and of the South. Their inroads

~375. were often vexatious, and sometimes formidable; but,

during the twelve years of the reign of Valentinian, his

firmness and vigilance protected his own dominions;

and his powerful genius seemed to inspire and direct

the feeble counsels of his brother. Perhaps the me­

thod of annals would more forcibly express the urgent

and divided cares of the two emperors; but the at­

tention of the reader, likewise, would be distracted

by a tedious and desultory narrative. A separate

view of the five great theatres of war; I. Germany;

II. Britain; III. Africa; IV. The East; and, V.

The Danube; will impress a more distinct image of

the military state of the empire under the reigns of

Valentinian and Valens.
