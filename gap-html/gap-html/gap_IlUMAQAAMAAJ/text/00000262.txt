THE DECLINE AND FALL

price which had seldom been known in the most

plentiful years; and that his own example might

strengthen his laws, he sent into the market four

hundred and twenty-two thousand modii, or mea­

sures, which were drawn by his order from the grana­

ries of Hierapolis, of Chalcis, and even of Egypt.

The consequences might have been foreseen, and

were soon felt. The Imperial wheat was purchased

by the rich merchants; the proprietors of land, or

of corn, withheld from the city the accustomed sup­

ply; and the small quantities that appeared in the

market were secretly sold at an advanced and illegal

price. Julian still continued to applaud his own

policy, treated the complaints of the people as a vain

and ungrateful murmur, and convinced Antioch that

he had inherited the obstinacy, though not the cruelty,

of his brother Gallus. The remonstrances of the

municipal senate served only to exasperate his in­

flexible mind. He was persuaded, perhaps with truth,

that the senators of Antioch who possessed lands, or

were concerned in trade, had themselves contributed

to the calamities of their country; and he imputed

the disrespectful boldness which they assumed to

the sense, not of public duty, but of private interest.

The whole body, consisting of two hundred of the

most noble and wealthy citizens, were sent under a

guard from the palace to the prison; and though

they were permitted, before the close of evening, to

return to their respective houses, the emperor him­

self could not obtain the forgiveness which he had

so easily granted. The same grievances were still

the subject of the same complaints, which were in­

dustriously circulated by the wit and levity of the

Syrian Greeks. During the licentious days of the

Saturnalia, the streets of the city resounded with in­

solent songs, which derided the laws, the religion,

the personal conduct, and even the beard, of the
