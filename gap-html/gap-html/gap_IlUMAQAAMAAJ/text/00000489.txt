OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

secresy, and success, with which this conspiracy

against Rufinus had been conducted, imprinted a

mark of indelible ridicule on the character of a mini-*

ster, who had suffered himself to be deceived, in a

he had secretly invited the Huns, and the Goths, to in­

vade the provinces of the empire, and to increase the

public confusion. The subtle prafect, whose life had
