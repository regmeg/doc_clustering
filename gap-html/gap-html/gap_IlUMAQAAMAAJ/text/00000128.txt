108 THE DECLINE AND FALL

chap. morning; and the son of Constantine, after ani-

'mating his soldiers by an eloquent speech, retired

into a church at some distance from the field of

battle, and committed to his generals the conduct

of this decisive day *. They deserved his confidence

by the valour and military skill which they exerted.

They wisely began the action upon the left; and

advancing their whole wing of cavalry in an oblique

line, they suddenly wheeled it on the right flank of

the enemy, which was unprepared to resist the im­

petuosity of their charge. But the Romans of the

West soon rallied, by the habits of discipline; and

the Barbarians of Germany supported the renown of

their national bravery. The engagement soon be­

came general; was maintained with various 'and

singular turns of fortune, and scarcely ended with

the darkness of the night. The signal victory which

Constantius obtained is attributed to the arms of

his cavalry. His cuirassiers are described as so

many massy statues of steel, glittering with their

scaly armour, and breaking with their ponderous

lances the firm array of the Gallic legions. As

soon as the legions gave way, the lighter and more

active squadrons of the second line rode sword

in hand into the intervals, and completed the dis­

order. In the mean while, the huge bodies of the

Germans were exposed almost naked to the dex­

terity of the oriental archers; and whole troops of

those Barbarians were urged by anguish and despair

to precipitate themselves into the broad and rapid

stream of the Drave. The number of the slain was

computed at fifty-four thousand men, andthe slaughter

of the conquerors was more considerable than that of

the vanquished; a circumstance which proves the ob­

stinacy of the contest, and justifies the observation

of an ancient writer, that the forces of the empire

were consumed in the fatal battle of Mursa, by the

Sulpicius Severus, 1 . ii. p. 405.
