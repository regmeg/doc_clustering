THE

HISTORY

OF THK

DECLINE AND FALL

OF THE

ROMAN EMPIRE.

*

CHAPTER XIV.

Foundation of Constantinople.—Political System of Con­

stantine, and his Successors.— Military Discipline.—

The Palace. — The Finances.

The unfortunate Licinius w<^s *he last rival who

opposed the greatness, and thft last captive who

adorned the triumph, of Constantine. After a tran­

quil and prosperous reign, the Conqueror bequeathed

to his family the inheritance of the Roman empire;

a new capital, a new policy, and a new religion;

and the innovations which he established have been

embraced and consecrated by succeeding generations.

The age of the great Constantine and his sons is

filled with important events; but the historian must

be oppressed by their number and variety, unless he

diligently separates from each other the scenes which

are connected only by the order of time. He will

describe the political institutions that gave strength

and stability to the empire, before he' proceeds to

relate the wars and revolutions which hastened its

decline.
