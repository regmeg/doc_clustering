THE DECLINE AND FAIX

of his life and greatness; and, as the last hope of

safety, he interposed the authority of the emperor

Arcadius. Stilicho, who appears to have directed

his march along the sea-coast of the Hadriatic, was

not far distant from the city of Thessalonica, when

he received a peremptory message, to recal the troops

of the East, and to declare, that his nearer approach

would be considered, by the Byzantine court, as an

act of hostility. The prompt and unexpected obe­

already engaged the affection of the Eastern troops,

he recommended to their zeal the execution of his

bloody design, which might be accomplished in his

absence with less danger, perhaps, and with less re­

proach. Stilicho left the command of the troops of

the East to Gainas, the Goth, on whose fidelity he

firmly relied; with an assurance, at least, that the

hardy Barbarian would never be diverted from his

purpose by any consideration of fear or remorse.

The soldiers were easily persuaded to punish the

general hatred which Rufinus had excited, that the

fatal secret, communicated to thousands, was faith­

fully preserved during the long march from Thessa­

lonica to the gates of Constantinople. As soon as

they had resolved his death, they condescended to

flatter his pride; the ambitious praefect was seduced

to believe, that those powerful auxiliaries might be

tempted to place the diadem on his head; and the

treasures which he distributed, with a tardy and re­

luctant hand, were accepted by the indignant multi­

tude as an insult, rather than as a gift. At the di­

stance of a mile from the capital, in the field of Mars,

before the palace of Hebdomon, the troops halted:

and the emperor, as well as his minister, advanced,

according to ancient custom, respectfully to salute
