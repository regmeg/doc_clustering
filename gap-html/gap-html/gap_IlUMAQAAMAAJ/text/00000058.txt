38 THE DECLINE AND FALL

chap. did not exceed the number of twenty thousand

XIV" persons. From this fact, and from similar examples,

there is reason to believe, that the constitution of the

legionary troops, to which they partly owed their

valour and discipline, was dissolved by Constantine;

and that the bands of Roman infantry, which still

assumed the same names and the same honours, con­

sisted only of one thousand or fifteen hundred men.

The conspiracy of so many separate detachments,

each of which was awed by the sense of its own weak­

ness, could easily be checked; and the successors of

Constantine might indulge their love of ostentation,

by issuing their orders to one hundred and thirty-two

legions, inscribed on the muster-roll of their nu­

merous armies. The remainder of their troops was

distributed into several hundred cohorts of infantry,

and squadrons of cavalry. Their arms, and titles,

and ensigns, were calculated to inspire terror, and to

display the variety of nations who marched under the

Imperial standard. And not a vestige was left of

that severe simplicity, which, in the ages of freedom

and victory, had distinguished the line of battle of a

Roman anny from the confused host of an Asiatic

monarch. A more particular enumeration, drawn

from the Notitia, might exercise the diligence of an

antiquary; but the historian will content himself

with observing, that the number of permanent sta­

tions or garrisons established on the frontiers of the

empire amounted to five hundred and eighty-three;

and that, under the successors of Constantine, the

complete force of the military establishment was com­

puted at six hundred and forty-five thousand sol­

diers*. An effort so prodigious surpassed the wants

of a more ancient, and the faculties of a later,

period.
