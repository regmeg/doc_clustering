OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 30

In the various states of society, armies are re- chap.

urged by the love of war; the citizens of a free re- Difficulty

supply of volunteers, obliged the emperors to adopt

more effectual and coercive methods. The lands

bestowed on the veterans, as the free reward of their
