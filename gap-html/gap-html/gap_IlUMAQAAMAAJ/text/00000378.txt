358 THJE DECLINE AND FALL

chap. enemies, by a bold and decisive measure. The em-

xx' press Justina, who had been left in a palace about

one hundred miles from Bregetio, was respectfully

invited to appear in the camp, with the son of the

deceased emperor. On the sixth day after the death

of Valentinian, the infant prince of the same name,

who was only four years old, was shown in the arms

of his mother, to the legions; and solemnly invested,

by military acclamation, with the titles and ensigns

of supreme power. The impending dangers of a

civil war were seasonably prevented by the wise

and moderate conduct of the emperor Gratian. He

cheerfully accepted the choice of the army; declared,

that he should always consider the son of Justina as

a brother, not as a rival; and advised the empress,

with her son Valentinian, to fix their residence at

Milan, in the fair and peaceful province of Italy;

while he assumed the more arduous command of the

countries beyond the Alps. Gratian dissembled his

resentment till he could safely punish, or disgrace,

the authors of the conspiracy; and though he uni­

formly behaved with tenderness and regard to his

infant colleague, he gradually confounded, in the

administration of the Western empire, the office of

a guardian with the authority of a sovereign. The

government of the Roman world was exercised in the

united names of Valens and his two nephews; but

the feeble emperor of the East, who succeeded to the

rank of his elder brother, never obtained any weight

or influence in the councils of the West *.

• Ammianus, xxx. 10. Zosimus, I. iv. p. 222, 223. Tillemont has proved

(Hist. des Empereurs, torn. v. p. 707—709), that Gratian reigned in Italy,

Africa, and Illyricum. I have endeavoured to express his authority over his

brother's dorninions, as he used it, in an ambiguous style.
