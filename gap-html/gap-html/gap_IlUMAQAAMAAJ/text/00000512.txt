492 THE DECLINE AND FALL

chap. the latter part of his life in writing the history of the

"Y Y ITT •,

'_ empire from the reign of Nerva to the death of Va­

lerius. Of this work, which consisted of thirty-one

books, only the last eighteen are now extant; but

these books contain a very circumstantial history of

twenty-five years; during which period Ammianus

was an eye-witness to the greater part of the trans­

actions which he relates. Minute accuracy, and strict .

veracity appear to be characteristics of this writer,

whom Mr. Gibbon repeatedly calls his faithful guide.

Though Ammianus is evidently desirous of placing

the character of Julian in as favourable a light as

possible, yet he does not allow his partiality for the

emperor to induce him to deviate from that strict

adherence to truth which is required of an historian.

He mentions the hypocrisy of Julian in endeavouring

to gain the favour of the Christians in Gaul, by join­

ing with them in the celebration of the Epiphany,

though he had already in secret abandoned their faith.

And he relates the execution of Ursulus, though he

cannot deny that it was an act of ingratitude, as well

as injustice, on the part of the emperor: the recital

of which will be displeasing to the favourers (fauto-

ribus) of Julian. He describes very minutely the

events of the Persian expedition; yet he abstains

from any censure on the imprudence of his hero, in

rejecting an offer of peace under the walls of Ctesi-

phon, when he might have dictated the conditions of

the treaty; instead of which, he led the Romans into

such a situation, that, in a short time afterwards, the

army could not be extricated without the most hu­

miliating sacrifices. I shall finish these observations

respecting Ammianus Marcellinus, with the expres­

sive words which conclude the valuable work of the

modest historian.
