vented the execution of the design which Julian had

frequently meditated, of relieving his head from the

weight of a costly diadem: but he absolutely refused

the title of Dominus, or Lord, a word which was

grown so familiar to the ears of the Romans, that

they no longer remembered its servile and humiliating

behaviour which had been assumed by the prudence

of Augustus, was adopted by Julian from choice, and

blamed a conduct, which, in their eyes, degraded the

majesty of the purple. But the behaviour of Julian

was uniformly supported. During the games of the

Circus, he had, imprudently or designedly, performed

the manumission of a slave in the presence of the

consul. The moment he was reminded that he had

trespassed on the jurisdiction of another magistrate,

he condemned himself to pay a fine of ten pounds of

gold; and embraced this public occasion of declaring
