OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 15

this artificial colony was raised at the expense of the chap.

ancient cities of the empire. Many opulent senators X1V'

of Rome, and of the Eastern provinces, were probably

invited by Constantine to adopt for their country the

fortunate spot which he had chosen for his own re足

sidence. The invitations of a master are scarcely to

be distinguished from commands; and the liberality

of the emperor obtained a ready and cheerful obedi足

ence. He bestowed on his favourites the palaces

which he had built in the several quarters of the city,

assigned them lands and pensions for the support of

their dignity, and alienated the demesnes of Pontus

and Asia, to grant hereditary estates by the easy

tenure of maintaining a house in the capital. But

these encouragements and obligations soon became

superfluous, and were gradually abolished. Wherever

the seat of government is fixed, a considerable part

of the public revenue will be expended by the prince

himself, by his ministers, by the officers of justice,

and by the domestics of the palace. The most

wealthy of the provincials will be attracted by the

powerful motives of interest and duty, of amusement

and curiosity. A third and more numerous class of

inhabitants will insensibly be formed, of servants, of

artificers, and of merchants, who derive their subsist足

ence from their own labour, and from the wants or

luxury of the superior ranks. In less than a century,

Constantinople disputed with Rome itself the pre足

eminence of riches and numbers. New piles of

buildings, crowded together with too little regard to

health or convenience, scarcely allowed the intervals

of narrow streets for the perpetual throng of men,

of horses, and of carriages. The allotted space of

ground was insufficient to contain the increasing

people ;and the additional foundations, which, on either

side, were advanced into the sea, might alone have

composed a very considerable city.
