THE DECLINE AND FALL

France cannot be magnified, either by fear or by

flattery, beyond the annual amount of eighteen mil­

lions sterling, which ought perhaps to be shared

among four-and-twenty millions of inhabitants *.

Seven millions of these, in the capacity of fathers,

or brothers, or husbands, may discharge the obliga­

tions of the remaining multitude of women and chil­

dren; yet the equal proportion of each tributary

subject will scarcely rise above fifty shillings of our

money, instead of a proportion almost four times as

considerable, which was regularly imposed on their

Gallic ancestors. The reason of this difference may

be found, not so much in the relative scarcity or

plenty of gold and silver, as in the different state of

society in ancient Gaul and in modern France. In

a country where personal freedom is the privilege of

eveiy subject, the whole mass of taxes, whether they

• are levied on property or on consumption, may be

fajrly divided among the whole body of the nation.

But the far greater part of the lands of ancient Gaul,

as well as of the other provinces of the Roman world,

were cultivated by slaves, or by peasants, whose de­

pendent condition was a less rigid servitude. In

such a state the poor were maintained at the expense

of the masters, who enjoyed the fruits of their la­

bour; and as the rolls of tribute were filled only

with the names of those citizens who possessed the

means of an honourable, or at least of a decent sub­

sistence, the comparative smallness of their numbers

explains and justifies the high rate of their capita­

tion. The truth of this assertion may be illustrated

by the following example: The iEdui, one of the

most powerful and civilized tribes or cities of Gaul,

occupied an extent of territory, which now contains

* This assertion, however formidable it may seem, is founded on the original  
registers of births, deaths, and marriages, collected by public authority, and
now

deposited in the CimtrSk General at Paris.
