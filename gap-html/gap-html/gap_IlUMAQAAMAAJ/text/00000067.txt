OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

domestics. The whole number consisted of three chap.

thousand five hundred men, divided into seven schools, XLV'

or troops, of five hundred each; and in the east, this

honourable service was almost entirely appropriated

to the Armenians. Whenever, on public ceremonies,

they were drawn up in the courts and porticoes of the

palace, their lofty stature, silent order, and splendid

arms of silver and gold, displayed a martial pomp, not

unworthy of the Roman majesty. From the seven

schools two companies of horse and foot were selected,

of the, protectors, whose advantageous station was

the hope and reward of the most deserving soldiers.

They mounted guard in the interior apartments, and

were occasionally despatched into the provinces, to

execute with celerity and vigour the orders of their

master. The counts of the domestics had succeeded

to the office of the Praetorian praefects; like the prae-

fects, they aspired from the service of the palace

to the command of armies.

The perpetual intercourse between the court and Agents or

the provinces was facilitated by the construction of ° 01 spie

roads and the institution of posts. But these bene­

ficial establishments were accidentally connected with

a pernicious and intolerable abuse. Two o$ three

hundred agents or messengers were employed, under

the jurisdiction of the master of the offices, to an­

nounce the names of the annual consuls, and the

edicts or victories of the emperors. They insensibly

assumed the licence of reporting whatever they could

observe of the conduct either of magistrates or of

private citizens; and were soon considered as the

eyes of the monarch, and the scourge of the people.

Under the warm influence of a feeble reign, they

multiplied to the incredible number of ten thousand,

disdained the mild though frequent admonitions of

the laws, and exercised in the profitable manage­

ment of the posts a rapacious and insolent oppression.
