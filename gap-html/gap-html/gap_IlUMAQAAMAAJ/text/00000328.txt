THE DECLINE AND FALL

lected the glories of the hoase of Constantine, and

they declared, with loyal acclamation, that they

would shed the last drop of their blood in the de­

In the meanwhile, Valentinian was alarmed and

perplexed, by the doubtful intelligence of the revolt

of the East. The difficulties of a German war forced
