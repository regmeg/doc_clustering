Alemanni, familiarized to the knowledge of the

country, secretly collected their scattered forces, and

seizing the opportunity of a dark and rainy day,

poured with unexpected fury on the rear-guard of

the Romans. Before the, inevitable disorder could

be remedied, two legions were destroyed; and Ju­

lian was taught by experience, that caution and

vigilance are the most important lessons of the art of

war. In a second and more successful action, he

recovered and established his military fame; but as

the agility of the Barbarians saved them from the

pursuit, his victory was neither bloody nor decisive.

He advanced, however, to the banks of the Rhine,

surveyed the ruins of Cologne, convinced himself of

the difficulties of the war, and retreated on the ap­

proach of winter, discontented with the court, with

his army, and with his own success. The power of

the enemy was yet unbroken; and the Caesar had

no sooner separated his troops and fixed his own m

quarters at Sens, in the centre of Gaul, than he was

surrounded and besieged by a numerous host of

Germans. Reduced in this extremity to the re­

sources of his own mind, he displayed a prudent

intrepidity which compensated for all the deficiencies

of the place and garrison; and the Barbarians, at

the end of thirty days, were obliged to retire with

disappointed rage.

The conscious pride of Julian, who was indebted His second

only to his sword for this signal deliverance, was ^iSaw.
