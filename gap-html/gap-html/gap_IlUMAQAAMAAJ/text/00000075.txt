OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. £5

them may perhaps reflect some light on the interest­

I. It is obvious, that, as long as the immutable

constitution of human nature produces and maintains

so unequal a division of property, the most numerous

part of the community would be deprived of their

subsistence, by the equal assessment of a tax from

which the sovereign would derive a very trifling re­

venue. Such indeed might be the theory of the

Roman capitation; but in the practice, this unjust

equality was no longer felt, as the tribute was col­

the wealthy provincial, in proportion to his fortune,

alone represented several of those imaginary beings.

In a poetical request, addressed to one of the last

his tribute under the figure of a triple monster, the

Geryon of the Grecian fables, and intreats the new

Hercules that he would most graciously be pleased

to save his life by cutting off three of his heads. The

fortune of Sidonius far exceeded the customary wealth

of a poet; but if he had pursued the allusion, he

must have painted many of the Gallic nobles with

the hundred heads of the deadly Hydra, spreading

governed by the absolute monarch of an industrious,

wealthy, and affectionate people. The taxes of
