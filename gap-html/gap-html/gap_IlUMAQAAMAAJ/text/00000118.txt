death of Dalmatius. The want of sincerity, which

Constantine experienced in a tedious and fruitless

the head of a tumultuary band, suited for rapine

rather than for conquest, he suddenly broke into the

dominions of Constans, by the way of the Julian

Alps, and the country round Aquileia felt the first

effects of his resentment. The measures of Constans,

who then resided in Dacia, were directed with more

prudence and ability. On the news of his brother's

invasion, he detached a select and disciplined body

of his Illyrian troops, proposing to follow them in

person, with the remainder of his forces. But the

conduct of his lieutenants soon terminated the un­

Constantine was betrayed into an ambuscade, which

scure stream of the Alsa, obtained the honours of an

Imperial sepulchre; but his provinces transferred

their allegiance to the conqueror, who, refusing to

admit his elder brother Constantius to any share in

these new acquisitions, maintained the undisputed

possession of more than two-thirds of the Roman
