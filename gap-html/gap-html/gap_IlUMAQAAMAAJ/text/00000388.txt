THE DECLINE AND FAIX

chap. brave officers who had served their country in the

XXL execution of their duty were punished by the loss

of their employments, and narrowly escaped the loss

of their heads. The Imperial mandate was at length

received for transporting over the Danube the whole

body of the Gothic nation; but the execution of this

order was a task of labour and difficulty. The stream

of the Danube, which in those parts is above a mile

broad, had been swelled by incessant rains; and, in

this tumultuous passage, many were swept away, and

drowned, by the rapid violence of the current. A

large fleet of vessels, of boats, and of canoes, was pro­

vided: many days and nights they passed and re­

passed with indefatigable toil; and the most strenuous

diligence was exerted by the officers of Valens, that

not a single Barbarian, of those who were reserved

to subvert the foundations of Rome, should be left

on the opposite shore. It was thought expedient

that an accurate account should be taken of their

numbers; but the persons who were employed soon

desisted, with amazement and dismay, from the pro­

secution of the endless and impracticable task: and

the principal historian of the age most seriously

affirms, that the prodigious armies of Darius and

Xerxes, which had so long been considered as the

fables of vain and credulous antiquity, were now jus­

tified, in the eyes of mankind, by the evidence of

fact and experience. A probable testimony has fixed

the number of the Gothic warriors at two hundred

thousand men; and if we can venture to add the

just proportion of women, of children, and of slaves,

the whole mass of people which composed this formi­

dable emigration must have amounted to near a mil­

lion of persons, of both sexes, and of all ages. The

children of the Goths, those at least of a distinguished

rank, were separated from the multitude. They

were conducted, without delay, to the distant seats
