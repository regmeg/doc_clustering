OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 197

monarch, after making some inquiry into the rank chap.

and character of his rival, despatched the informer XVIL

with a present of a pair of purple slippers, to com­

plete the magnificence of his Imperial habit. A more

dangerous conspiracy was formed by ten of the do­

life at Antioch, are described by Ammianus (xxii. 9, 10. and Vales. ad loc.),

and Libanius (Orat. Parent. c. 99. p. 323).
