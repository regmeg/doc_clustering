pomp of this memorable festival may easily be sup­

the city returned, the statue of Constantine, framed

Hippodrome. When it was opposite to the throne

of the reigning emperor, he rose from his seat, and

with grateful reverence adored the memory of his

fancy by the singular picture of a great empire, but

will tend to illustrate the secret and internal causes

of its rapid decay. In the pursuit of any remarkable

institution, we may be frequently led into the more

early or the more recent times of the Roman history;
