OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 351

the senate of Constantinople, which assumed, for the chap.

first time, a share in the public deliberations; and'

the same generals, Victor and Arintheus, who had

successfully directed' the conduct of the war, were em­

powered to regulate the conditions of peace. The

freedom of trade, which the Goths had hitherto en­

joyed, was restricted to two cities on the Danube;

the rashness of their leaders was severely punished by

the suppression of their pensions and subsidies; and

the exception, which was stipulated in favour of

Athanaric alone, was more advantageous than honour­

able to the Judge of the Visigoths. Athanaric, who,

on this occasion, appears to have consulted his private

interest, without expecting the orders of his sovereign,

supported his own dignity, and that of his tribe, in

the personal interview which was proposed by the

ministers of Valens. He-persisted in his declaration,

that it was impossible for him, without incurring the

guilt of perjury, ever to set his foot on the territory

of the empire; and it is more than probable, that

his regard for the sanctity of an oath was confirmed

by the recent arid fatal examples of Roman treachery.

The Danube, which separated the dominions of the

two independent nations, was chosen for the scene of

the conference. The emperor of the East, and the Judge

of the Visigoths, accompanied by an equal number of

armed followers, advanced in their respective barges

to the middle of the stream. After the ratification

of the treaty, and the delivery of hostages, Valens

returned in triumph to Constantinople; and the

Goths remained in a state of tranquillity about six

years;, till they were violently impelled against the

Roman empire, by an innumerable host of Scythians,

who appeared to issue from the frozen regions of the

North *.

* The Gothic war is described by Ammianus (xxvii. 5.), Zosimus (1 . iv. p.  
21 \—2\4.), and Themistius (Orat. x. p. 129—141.).
