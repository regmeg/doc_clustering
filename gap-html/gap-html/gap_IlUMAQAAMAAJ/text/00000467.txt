sence, of Theodosius; and by the advice, that he chap.

would confine himself to the use of prayer, without XXIL

presuming to approach the altar of Christ, or to re--

ceive the holy eucharist with those hands that were

still polluted with the blood of an innocent people.

The emperor was deeply affected by his own re­

proaches, and by those of his spiritual father; and,

after he had bewailed the mischievous and irreparable

annals of the church. According to the mildest rules

of ecclesiastical discipline, which were established in

the fourth centuiy, the crime of homicide wa3 ex­

impossible, in the period of human life, to purge the

accumulated guilt of the massacre of Thessalonica,

the murderer should have been excluded from the

holy communion till the hour of his death. But the

archbishop, consulting the maxims of religious policy,

granted some indulgence to the rank of his illustrious

penitent, who humbled in the dust the pride of the

diadem; and the public edification might be admitted

as a weighty reason to abridge the duration of his
