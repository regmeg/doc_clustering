THE DECLINE AND FALL

are contained in it. The twenty-third chapter of the

original, like the twentieth, is accordingly abridged ;but

the points which are retained are given, without any

addition, in the language of Mr. Gibbon. I have

carefully avoided the omission or alteration of a single

word in that point of the narrative which relates to

the remarkable circumstances that attended the at足

tempt of Julian to rebuild the temple at Jerusalem.

I think it will be satisfactory to observe, in respect to

Ammianus Marcellinus, as was noticed in the former

case of Tacitus, how little is the amount of all that

can be urged by the ingenuity of our author, to lessen

the weight of the evidence which is derived to Chris足

tianity from the testimony of the two great pagan

historians. The words of Ammianus are indeed of

such importance, that I think it right to follow the

example of Mr. Gibbon, who has given them in the

original Latin in a note. But that I may not be ac足

cused of a partial or imperfect quotation, I shall in足

sert the whole of the first page of the twenty-third

Book of Ammianus Marcellinus: "Haec eo anno, ut

"prretereamus negotiorum minutias, agebantur per

"provincias: Julianus vero jam ter consule ascito in

"collegio trabeae Sallustio praefecto perGallias, qua-

"ter ipse amplissimum inierat magistratum: et vide

"batur novum adjunctum esse Augusto privatum,

"quod post Diocletianum et Aristobulum nullus me-

"minerat gestum. Et licet accidentium varietatem

"sollicita mente praecipiens, multiplicatos expedi-

"tionis apparatus flagranti studio perurgeret, deligen-

"tiae tamen ubique diffidens, imperiique sui memo-

"bitiosum quondam apud Hierosolymam templum,

"quod post multa et interneciva certamina, obsidente
