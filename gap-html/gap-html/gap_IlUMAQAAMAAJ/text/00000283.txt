OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE; 263

Seleucia were for ever extinguished; and the only chap.

remaining quarter of that Greek colony had resumed, XIX"

with the Assyrian language and manners, the primi­

tive appellation of Coche. Coche was situate on the

western side of the Tigris ; but it was naturally con­

sidered as a suburb of Ctesiphon, with which we may

suppose it to have been connected by a permanent

bridge of boats. The united parts contributed to

form the common epithet of Al Modain, the cities,

which the Orientals have bestowed on the winter re­

sidence of the Sassanides; and the whole circum­

ference of the Persian capital was strongly fortified

by the waters of the river, by lofty walls, and by im­

practicable morasses. Near the ruins of Seleucia, the

camp of Julian was fixed; and secured, by a ditch

and rampart, against the sallies of the numerous and

enterprising garrison of Coche. In this fruitful and

pleasant country, the Romans were plentifully sup­

plied with water and forage; and several forts, which

might have embarrassed the motions of the army, sub­

mitted, after some resistance, to the efforts of their

valour. The fleet passed from the Euphrates into an

artificial derivation of that river, which pours a copious

and navigable stream into the Tigris, at a small di­

stance below the great city. If they had followed this

royal canal, which bore the name of Nahar-Malcha,

the intermediate situation of Coche would have sepa­

rated the fleet and army of Julian; and the rash at­

tempt of steering against the current of the Tigris,

and forcing their way through the midst of a hostile

capital, must have been attended with the total de­

struction of the Roman navy. The prudence of the

emperor foresaw the danger, and provided the re­

medy. As he had minutely studied the operations

of Trajan in the same country, he soon recollected,

that his warlike predecessor had dug a new and na­

vigable canal, which, leaving Coche on the right hand,
