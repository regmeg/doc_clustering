OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 899

in the study of the reign of Theodosius, we are re- chap.

by the obscure hints of fragments and chronicles, by

the figurative style of poetry or panegyric, and by

the precarious assistance of the ecclesiastical writers.

Conscious of these disadvantages, which will con­
