OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

moments of grief and deliberation. In this scene of chap.

terror and distress, the body of the deceased prince, XIX'

according to his own directions, was decently em­

balmed; and, at the dawn of day, the generals con­

vened a military senate, at which the commanders

of the legions, and the officers, both of cavalry and

infantry, were invited to assist. Three or four hours

of the night had not passed away without some secret

cabals; and when the election of an emperor was

proposed, the spirit of faction began to agitate the

assembly. Victor and Arinthaeus collected the re­

mains of the court of Constantius; the friends of

Julian attached themselves to the Gallic chiefs, Da-

galaiphus and Nevitta; and the most fatal conse­

quences might be apprehended from the discord of

two factions, so opposite in their character and in­

terest, in their maxims of government, and perhaps

in their religious principles. The superior virtues of

Sallust could alone reconcile their divisions, and

unite their suffrages; and the venerable praefectwould

immediately have been declared the successor of

Julian, if he himself, with sincere and modest firm­

ness, had not alleged his age and infirmities, so un­

equal to the weight of the diadem. The generals,

who were surprised and perplexed by his refusal,

showed some disposition to adopt the salutary advice

of an inferior officer *, that they should act as they

would have acted in the absence of the emperor;

that they should exert their abilities to extricate the

army from the present distress; and, if they were

fortunate enough to reach the confines of Mesopo­

tamia, they should proceed with united and delibe­

rate counsels in the election of a lawful sovereign.

While they debated, a few voices saluted Jovian,

* Honoratior aliquis miles; perhaps Ammianus himself. The modest and  
judicious historian describes the scene of the election,at which he was
undoubtedly

present (xxv. 5.)
