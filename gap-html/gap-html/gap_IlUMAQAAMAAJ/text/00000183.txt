Julian is declared Emperor by the Legions of Gaul. — His

March and Success.—The Death of Constantius.— Civil

Administration of Julian.

While the Romans languished under the igno- chap.

minious tyranny of Constantius, the praises of Julian XVIL

were repeated with transport in every part of the The jea-

empire, except in the palace of the emperor. The Constan.

Barbarians of Germany had felt, and still dreaded, j^fm

the arms of the young Caesar; his soldiers were the

companions of his victory; the grateful provincials

enjoyed the blessings of his reign; but the favourites,

who had opposed his elevation, were offended by his

virtues; and they justly considered the friend of the

people as the enemy of the court. As long as the

fame of Julian was doubtful, the buffoons of the

palace, who were skilled in the language of satire,

tried the efficacy of those arts which they had so

often practised with success. They easily discovered,

that his simplicity was not exempt from affectation:

the ridiculous epithets of an hairy savage, of an ape

invested with the purple, were applied to the dress

and person of the philosophic warrior; and his modest

despatches were stigmatized as the vain and elaborate

fictions of a loquacious Greek, a speculative soldier,

who had studied the art of war amidst the groves of

the academy. The voice of malicious folly was at

length silenced by the shouts of victory; the con­

queror of the Franks and Alemanni could no longer

be painted as an object of contempt; and the mon­

arch himself was meanly ambitious of stealing from

his lieutenant the honourable reward of his labours.
