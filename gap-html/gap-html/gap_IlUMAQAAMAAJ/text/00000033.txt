'•W. OF THE ltOMAN EMPIRE. 13

ference. On the summit of the pillar, «above one chap.

hundred and twenty feet from the ground, stood the'

colossal statue of Apollo. It was of bronze, had been

transported either from Athens or from a town of

Phrygia, and was supposed to be the work of Phidias.

The artist had represented the god of day, or, as it

was afterwards interpreted, the emperor Constantine

himself, with a sceptre in his right hand, the globe

of the world in his left, and a crown of rays glitter­

ing on his head. The Circus, or Hippodrome, was

a stately building about four hundred paces in length,

and one hundred in breadth. The space between

the two metce or goals was filled with statues and

obelisks; and we may still remark a very singular

fragment of antiquity; the bodies of three serpents,

twisted into one pillar of'brass. Their triple heads

had once supported the golden tripod which, after

the defeat of Xerxes, was consecrated in the temple

of Delphi by the victorious Greeks. The beauty of

the Hippodrome has been long since defaced by the

rude hands of the Turkish conquerors; but, under

the similar appellation of Atmeidan, it still serves as

a place of exercise for their horses. From the throne,

whence the emperor viewed the Circensian games, a

winding staircase descended to the palace; a mag­

nificent edifice, which scarcely yielded to the residence

of Rome itself, and which, together with the de­

pendent courts, gardens, and porticoes, covered a

considerable extent of ground upon the banks of the

Propontis between the Hippodrome and the church"*

of St. Sophia. We might likewise celebrate the

baths, which still retained the name of Zeuxippus,

after they had been enriched, by the munificence of

Constantine, with lofty columns, various marbles,

and above threescore statues of bronze. But we

should deviate from the design of this history, if we

attempted minutely to describe the different buildings
