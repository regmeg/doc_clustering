OF THE ROMAN EMPIHE.

the inhospitable table of two Imperial generals was C**£P.

stained with the royal blood of two guests and allies,'

inhumanly murdered by their order, and in their pre­

sence. The fate of Gabinius, and of Para, was the

same: but the cruel death of their sovereign was re­

sented in a very different manner by the servile tem­

per of the Armenians, and the free and daring spirit

of the Germans. The Quadi were much declined

from that formidable power, which, in the time of

Marcus Antoninus, had spread terror to the gates of

Rome. But they still possessed arms and courage;

their courage was animated by despair, and they ob­

tained the usual reinforcement of the cavalry of their

Sarmatian allies. So improvident was the assassin

Marcellinus, that he chose the moment when the

bravest veterans had been drawn away, to suppress

the revolt of Firmus; and the whole province was

exposed, with a very feeble defence, to the rage of

the exasperated Barbarians. They invaded Panno-

nia in the season of harvest; unmercifully destroyed

every object of plunder which they could not easily

transport; and either disregarded, or demolished,

the empty fortifications. The princess Constantia,

the daughter of the emperor Constantius, and the

grand-daughter of the great Constantine, very nar­

rowly escaped. That royal maid, who had innocently

supported the revolt of Procopius, was now the de­

stined wife of the heir of the Western empire. She

traversed the peaceful province with a splendid and

unarmed train. Her person was saved from danger,

and the republic from disgrace, by the active zeal of

Messala, governor of the provinces. As soon as he

was informed that the village, where she stopped

only to dine, was almost encompassed by the Barba­

rians, he hastily placed her in his own chariot, and

drove full speed till he reached the gates of Sirmium,

which were at the distance of six-and-twenty miles.
