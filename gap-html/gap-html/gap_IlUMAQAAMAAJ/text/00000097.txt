OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. v Tt

masters of the Roman world, might be excused by chap.

the partiality of paternal affection; but it is not easy XV'

to understand the motives of the emperor, when

he endangered the safety both of his family and of

his people, by the unnecessary elevation of his two

nephews, Dalmatius and Hannibalianus. The former

was raised, by the title of Caesar, to an equality with

his cousins. In favour of the latter, Constantine

invented the new and singular appellation of Nobi-

lissimus; to which he annexed the flattering distinc­

series of Roman princes in any age of the empire,

Hannibalianus alone was distinguished by the title

of King; a name which the subjects of Tiberius

would have detested, as the profane and cruel insult

of capricious tyranny. The use of such a title, even

as it appears under the reign of Constantine, is a

strange and unconnected fact, which can scarcely be

admitted on the joint authority of Imperial medals

and contemporary writers.

The whole empire was deeply interested in the Their edu-

education of these five youths, the acknowledged

successors of Constantine. The exercises of the body

prepared them for the fatigues of war, and the duties

of active life. Those who occasionally mention the

education or talents of Constantius, allow that he

excelled in the gymnastic arts of leaping and run­

ning; that he was a dexterous archer, a skilful

horseman, and a master of all the different weapons

used in the service either of the cavalry or of the in­

fantry. The same assiduous cultivation was bestowed,

though not perhaps with equal success, to improve

the minds of the sons and nephews of Constantine.

The most celebrated professors of the Christian faith,

of the Grecian philosophy, and of the Roman juris­

prudence, were invited by the liberality of the em­

peror, who reserved for himself the important task of
