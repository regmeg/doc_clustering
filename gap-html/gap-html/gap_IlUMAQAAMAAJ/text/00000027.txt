Orpheus, has frequently bestowed on the Hellespont.

But our ideas of greatness are of a relative nature:

and his fancy painted those celebrated streights, with

all the'attributes of a mighty river flowing with a

swift current, in the midst of a woody and inland

country, and at length, through a wide mouth, dis­

Ancient Troy, seated on an eminence at the foot of

Mount Ida, overlooked the mouth of the Hellespont,

which scarcely received an accession of waters from
