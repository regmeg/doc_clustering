THE DECLINE AND FALL

Julian was an object of terror and hatred to the

Persians ; and the painters of that nation represented

the invader of their country under the emblem of a

furious lion, who vomited from his mouth a consuming

fire. To his friends and soldiers, the philosophic hero

appeared in a more amiable light; and his virtues

laid one of his adversaries dead at his feet. The esteem
