OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 457

his unworthy rivals, he called his younger son, Ho-

norius, to enjoy the fruits of the victory, and to re­

ceive the sceptre of the West from the hands of his

which sacrifices, without'a blush, the consideration of

duty and interest to the base indulgence of sloth and

appetite*. The complaints of contemporary writers,
