THE DECLINE AND FALL

been spent in the intrigues of the palace, opposed,

with equal arms, the artful measures of the eunuch

Eutropius; but the timid soul of Rufinus was asto­

nished by the hostile approach of a more formidable

rival, of the great Stilicho, the general, or rather the

master, of the empire of the West.

The celestial gift which Achilles obtained, and

Alexander envied, of a poet worthy to celebrate the

actions of heroes, has been enjoyed by Stilicho, in a

much higher degree than might have been expected

from the declining state of genius, and of art. The

muse of Claudian, devoted to his service, was always

prepared to stigmatize his adversaries, Rufinus or

Eutropius, with eternal infamy; or to paint, in the

most splendid colours, the victories, and virtues, of a

powerful benefactor. In the review of a period in­

differently supplied with authentic materials, we can­

not refuse to illustrate the annals of Honorius from

the invectives, or the panegyrics, of a contemporary

writer; but as Claudian appears to have indulged the

most ample privilege of a poet and a courtier, some

criticism will be requisite to translate the language

of fiction, or exaggeration, into the truth and simpli­

city of historic prose. His silence concerning the

family of Stilicho may be admitted as a proof, that

his patron was neither able, nor desirous, to boast of

a long series of illustrious progenitors; and the slight

mention of his father, an officer of Barbarian cavalry,

in the service of Valens, seems to countenance the

assertion, that the general, who so long commanded

the armies of Rome, was descended from the savage

and perfidious race of the Vandals. If Stilicho had

not possessed the external advantages of strength

and stature, the most flattering bard, in the pre­

sence of so many thousand spectators, would have

hesitated to affirm, that he surpassed the measure

of the demigods of antiquity; and that whenever

he moved, with lofty steps, through the streets of
