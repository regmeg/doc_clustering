90 THE DECLINE AND FALL

chap. standards of his brothers, Constantius, at the head

* of the effeminate troops of Asia, was left to sustain  
the weight of the Persian war. At the decease of

Constantine, the throne of the east was filled by

Sapor, son of Hormouz, or Hormisdas, and grandson

of Narses, who, after the victory of Galerius, had

humbly confessed the superiority of the Roman

power. Although Sapor was in the thirtieth year of

his long reign, he was still in the vigour of youth, as

the date of his accession, by a very strange fatality,

had preceded that of his birth. The wife of Hor­

mouz remained pregnant at the time of her husband's

death; and the uncertainty of the sex, as well as of

the event, excited the ambitious hopes of the princes

of the house of Sassan. The apprehensions of civil

war were at length removed, by the positive assurance

of the Magi, that the widow of Hormouz had con­

ceived, and would safely produce a son. Obedient

to the voice of superstition, the Persians prepared,

without delay, the ceremony of his coronation. A

royal bed, on which the queen lay in state, was exhi­

placed on the spot, which might be supposed to con­

Satraps adored the majesty of their invisible and in­

sensible sovereign. If any credit can be given to

this marvellous tale, which seems however to be coun­

tenanced by the manners of the people, and by the

extraordinary duration of his reign, we must admire

not only the fortune, but the genius, of Sapor. In

the soft sequestered education of a Persian haram,

the royal youth could discover the importance of

exercising the vigour of his mind and body; and, by

his personal merit, deserved a throne, on which he

had been seated, while he was yet unconscious of the

duties and temptations of absolute power. His mi­

nority was exposed to the almost inevitable calamities
