444 THE DECLINE AND FAIX

chap. polis of all the lllyrian provinces, had been protected

fluctuated between the counsels of clemency and of

revenge; the zeal of the bishops had almost extorted

from the reluctant emperor the promise of a general

pardon ; his passion was again inflamed by the flatter­
