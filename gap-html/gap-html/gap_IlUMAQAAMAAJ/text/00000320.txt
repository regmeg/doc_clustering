THE DECLINE AND FALL

chap. inspired his friends with awe, and his enemies with

xx' fear: and, to second the efforts of his undaunted

courage, the son of Gratian had inherited the advan­

tages of a strong and healthy constitution. By the

habits of chastity and temperan^, which restrain the

appetites and invigorate the faculties, Valentinian

preserved his own, and the public, esteem. The avo­

cations of a military life had diverted his youth from

the elegant pursuits of literature; he was ignorant

of the Greek language, and the arts of rhetoric; but

as the mind of the orator was never disconcerted by

timid perplexity, he was able, as often as the occasion

prompted him, to deliver his decided sentiments with

bold and ready elocution. The laws of martial dis­

cipline were the only laws that he had studied; and

he was soon distinguished by the laborious diligence,

and inflexible severity, with which he discharged and

enforced the duties of the camp. In the time of Julian

he provoked the danger of disgrace, by the contempt

which he publicly expressed for the reigning religion;

and it should seem, from his subsequent conduct, that

the indiscreet and unseasonable freedom of Valen­

tinian was the effect of military spirit, rather than

of Christian zeal. He was pardoned, however, and

still employed by a prince who esteemed his merit:

and in the various events of the Persian war, he im­

proved the reputation which he had already acquired

on the banks of the Rhine. The celerity and success

with which he executed an important commission re­

commended him to the favour of Jovian; and to the

honourable command of the second school, or com­

pany, of Targetteers, of the domestic guards. In the

march from Antioch, he had reached his quarters at

Ancyra, when he was unexpectedly summoned with­

out guilt, and without intrigue, to assume, in the

forty-third year of his age, the absolute government

of the Roman empire.
