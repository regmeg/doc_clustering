THE DECLINE AND FALL

the honours and emoluments of some provincial go­

vernment: the lives and fortunes of the unhappy

people were abandoned to the most liberal purchaser;

and the public discontent was sometimes appeased by

the sacrifice of an unpopular criminal, whose punish­

had employed a considerable part of his inheritance,

the fruit of rapine and corruption, to purchase the

friendship of Rufinus, and the high office of Count
