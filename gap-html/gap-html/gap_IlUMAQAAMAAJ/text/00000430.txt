410 THE DECLINE AND FALL

chap. and resentment, and soon dismissed the tumultuous

XXL assembly. Fravitta, alarmed and exasperated by the

insolence of his rival, whose departure from the palace

might have been the signal of a civil war, boldly fol­

lowed him; and, drawing his sword, laid Priulf dead

at his feet. Their companions flew to arms; and

the faithful champion of Rome would have been op­

pressed by superior numbers, if he had not been pro­

tected by the seasonable interposition of the Imperial

guards. Such were the scenes of Barbaric rage which

disgraced the palace and table of the Roman emperor;

and, as the impatient Goths could only be restrained

by the firm and temperate character of Theodosius;

the public safety seemed to depend on the life and

abilities of a single man *.

* Les Goths ravagerent tout depuis le Danube jusqu'au Bosphore; exterminer-  
ent Valens et son armee; et ne repasserent le Danube, que pour abandonner

4"9;

Considerations sur les Causes de la Grandeur et de la Decadence des Remains,

c. xvii). The president Montesquieu seems ignorant that the Goths, after the

defeat of Valens, never abandoned the Roman territory. It is now thirty years,

says Claudian (de Bello Getico, 166, &c. A. D. 494),

Ex quo jam patrios gens haec oblita Triones,

Atque Istrum transvecta semel, vestigia fixit

Threicio funcstn solo

The error is inexcusable; since it disguises the principal and immediate cause

of the fall of the Western Empire of Rome.
