OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 425

to imagine, that the violence of zeal and revenge was, chap.

in some measure, eluded by the want of resistance;'

and that, in their adversity, the Arians displayed

much less firmness than had been exerted by the

orthodox party under the reigns of Constantius and

Valens. The opinions of Arianism might satisfy a

cold and speculative mind; but the doctrine of the

Nicene Creed, most powerfully recommended by the

merits of faith and devotion, was much better adapted

to become popular and successful in a believing age.

The hope that truth and wisdom would be found ™e cmm-

in the assemblies of the orthodox clergy induced the stantinople,

emperor to convene, at Constantinople, a synod of May.'381'

one hundred and fifty bishops, who proceeded, with­

out much difficulty or delay, to complete the theo­

logical system which had been established in the coun­

cil of Nice. The vehement disputes of the fourth

century had been chiefly employed on the nature of

the Son of God; and the various opinions, which

were embraced concerning the Second, were extended

and transferred, by a natural analogy, to the Third,

person of the Trinity. Yet it was found, or it was

thought, necessary, by the victorious adversaries of

Arianism, to explain the ambiguous language of some

respectable doctors; to confirm the faith of the Ca­

tholics; and to condemn an unpopular and incon­

sistent sect of Macedonians; who freely admitted

that the Son was consubstantial to the Father, while

they were fearful of seeming to acknowledge the ex­

istence of Three Gods. A final and unanimous sen­

tence was pronounced to ratify the equal Deity of

the Holy Ghost; the mysterious doctrine has been

received by all the nations, and all the churches of

the Christian world; and their grateful reverence has

assigned to the bishops of Theodosius the second

rank among the general councils.
