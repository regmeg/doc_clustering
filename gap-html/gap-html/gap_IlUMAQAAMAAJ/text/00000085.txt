OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 65

The kings of Iberia and Armenia worshipped the chap.

God of their protector; and their subjects, who have !_

invariably preserved the name of Christians, soon

formed a sacred and perpetual connexion with their

Roman brethren. The Christians of Persia were

suspected in time of war of preferring their religion

to their country; but as long as peace subsisted beÂ­

tween the two empires, the persecuting spirit of the

Magi was effectually restrained by the interposition

of Constantine. The rays of the Gospel illuminated

the coast of India. The colonies of Jews who had

penetrated into Arabia and ^Ethiopia opposed the

progress of Christianity; but the labour of the

Missionaries was in some measure facilitated by a

previous knowledge of the Mosaic revelation; and

Abyssinia still reveres the memory of Frumentius,

who in the time of Constantine devoted his life to

the conversion of those sequestered regions.
