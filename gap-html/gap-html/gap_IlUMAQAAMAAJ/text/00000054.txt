THE DECLINE AND FALL

had been adopted only as an occasional expedient.

The supreme jurisdiction exercised by the Praetorian

praefects over the armies of the empire, was trans­

ferred to the two masters general whom he insti­

tuted, the one for the cavalry, the other for the

infantry; and though each of these illustrious of­

ficers was more peculiarly responsible for the discipline

of those troops which were under his immediate in­

spection, they both indifferently commanded in the

field the several bodies, whether of horse or foot,

which were united in the same army. Their number

was soon doubled by the division of the east and

west; and as separate generals of the same rank

and title were appointed on the four important fron­

tiers of the Rhine, of the Upper and the Lower

Danube, and of the Euphrates, the defence of the

Roman empire was at length committed to eight

masters general of the cavalry and infantry. Under

their orders, thirty-five military commanders were

stationed in the provinces: three in Britain, six in

Gaul, one in Spain, one in Italy, five on the Upper,

and four on the Lower Danube; in Asia eight, three

in Egypt, and four in Africa. The titles of counts,

and dukes, by which they were properly distin­

guished, have obtained in modern languages so very

different a sense, that the use of them may occasion

some surprise. But it should be recollected, that

the second of those appellations is only a corruption

of the Latin word, which was indiscriminately ap­

plied to any military chief. All these provincial

generals were therefore dukes; but no more than

ten among them were dignified with the rank of

counts or companions, a title of honour, or rather

of favour, which had been recently invented in the

court of Constantine. A gold belt was the ensign

which distinguished the office of the counts and
