than a cloud of dust arose on the plain. The Romans,

who now aspired only to the permission of a safe and

speedy retreat, endeavoured to persuade themselves,

that this formidable appearance was occasioned by

a troop of wild asses, or perhaps by the approach of

some friendly Arabs. They halted, pitched their

tents, fortified their camp, passed the whole night in

continual alarms; and discovered, at the dawn of day,
