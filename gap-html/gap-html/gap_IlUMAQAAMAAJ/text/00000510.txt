400 THE DECLINE AND FALL

L_ in his history which should lead one to imagine that

he supposed them to proceed from a miraculous

origin. It appears from Warburton that the same

idea has been entertained by some other persons,

who thought that the evidence of the fact was irre­

sistible. I am now desirous of considering the effect

of the term of years which intervened between the

occurrence of the event and the time of writing the

history. It is indeed with great diffidence that I

venture to offer an opinion, that this very circum­

stance, instead of being, as Mr. Gibbon supposes,

an objection, is in reality a strong confirmation of

the truth of the narrative. When the event hap­

pened, Ammianus was at no greater distance from

Jerusalem than Antioch, where he held a distin­

taking and its failure must have been known to him

at the time. He must have known the account

which was given by Alypius, of his unsuccessful en­

deavours to execute the orders of the emperor. Ju­

lian himself mentions his intention of rebuilding the

temple. It is universally known that it was not

rebuilt: and Ammianus, at the expiration of twenty

years, relates in his history the circumstance which

prevented it. If he had written this account imme­

diately after the occurrence, it might have been said

it was a rumour invented by party zeal, and propa­

gated by enthusiasm and credulity. It might then

have been urged, that the imposition and falsehood

would probably, in a short time, have been detected;

that pagan authors would have exposed the deceptions

which had originated from the Christians; and that

if Ammianus had written a few years later, he would

probably have had a clearer view of the matter, and

would not have given credit to the romance of the

day. But the history is composed twenty years after
