OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 245

and indifference; required a formal invitation for chap.

each visit; and taught his sovereign an important XIX,

lesson, that he might command the obedience of a

subject, but that he must deserve the attachment of

a friend. The sophists of every age, despising, or

affecting to despise, the accidental distinctions of .

birth and fortune, reserve their esteem for the su­

perior qualities of the mind, with which they them­

selves are so plentifully endowed. Julian might dis­

dain the acclamations of a venal court, who adored

the Imperial purple; but he was deeply flattered by

the praise, the admonition, the freedom, and the

envy of an independent philosopher, who refused his

favours, loved his person, celebrated his fame, and

protected his memory. The voluminous writings of

Libanius still exist; for the most part, they are the

vain and idle compositions of an orator, who culti­

vated the science of words; the productions of a

recluse student, whose mind, regardless of his con­

temporaries, was incessantly fixed on the Trojan

war, and the Athenian commonwealth. Yet the

sophist of Antioch sometimes descended from this

imaginary elevation; he entertained a various and

elaborate correspondence; he praised the virtues of

his own times; he boldly arraigned the abuses of

public and private life; and he eloquently pleaded

the cause of Antioch against the just resentment of

Julian and Theodosius. It is the common calamity

of old age, to lose whatever might have rendered it

desirable; but Libanius experienced the peculiar

misfortune of surviving the religion and the sciences,

to which he had consecrated his genius. The friend

of Julian was an indignant spectator of the triumph

of Christianity; and his bigotry, which darkened

the prospect of the visible world, did not inspire Li­

banius with any lively hopes of celestial glory and

happiness.
