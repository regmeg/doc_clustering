a sudden deluge to the progress of an invading army. XIX'

To the soil and climate of Assyria, nature had denied

some of her choicest gifts, the vine, the olive, and the

fig-tree; but the food which supports the life of man,

and particularly wheat and barley, were produced with

inexhaustible fertility; and the husbandman, who

committed his seed to the earth, was frequently re足

warded with an increase of two, or even of three,

hundred. The face of the country was interspersed

with groves of innumerable palm-trees; and the dili足

gent natives celebrated, either in verse or prose, the

three hundred and sixty uses to which the trunk, the

branches, the leaves, the juice, and the fruit, were

skilfully applied. Several manufactures, especially

those of leather and linen, employed the industry of

a numerous people, and afforded valuable materials

for foreign trade; which appears, however, to have

been conducted by the hands of strangers. Babylon

had been converted into a royal park; but near the

ruins of the ancient capital, new cities had successively

arisen, and the populousness of the country was dis足

played in the multitude of towns and villages, which

were built of bricks, dried in the sun, and strongly

cemented with bitumen, the natural and peculiar pro足

duction of the Babylonian soil. While the successors

of Cyrus reigned over Asia, the province of Assyria

alone maintained, during a third part of the year,

the luxurious plenty of the table and household of

the Great King. Four considerable villages were

assigned for the subsistence of his Indian dogs; eight

hundred stallions, and sixteen thousand mares, were

constantly kept, at the expense of the country, for

the royal stables: and as the daily tribute, which was

paid to the satrap, amounted to one English bushel

of silver, we may compute the annual revenue of

Assyria at more than twelve hundred thousand pounds

sterling.
