THE DECLINE AND FALL

the faith, would be deprived of the common benefits

of nature and society. Every calumny that could

wound the reputation of the Apostate was cre­

dulously embraced by the fears and hatred of his ad­

versaries; and their indiscreet clamours provoked

the temper of a sovereign, whom it was their duty to

respect, and their interest to flatter. They still

protested, that prayers and tears were their only

weapons against the impious tyrant, whose head they

devoted to the justice of offended Heaven. But they

insinuated, with sullen resolution, that their sub­

mission was no longer the effect of weakness; and

that, in the imperfect state of human virtue, the

patience, which is founded on principle, may be ex­

hausted by persecution. It is impossible to deter­

mine how far the zeal of Julian would have prevailed

over his good sense and humanity: but, if we se­

riously reflect on the strength and spirit of the church,

we shall be convinced, that, before the emperor

could have extinguished the religion of Christ, he

must have involved his country in the horrors of a

civil war.
