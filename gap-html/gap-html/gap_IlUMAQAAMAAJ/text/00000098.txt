THE DECLINE AND FALI.

. instructing the royal youths in the science of govern-

__ ment, and the knowledge of mankind. But the

genius of Constantine himself had been formed by

adversity and experience. In the free intercourse of

private life, and amidst the dangers of the court of

Galerius, he had learned to command his own pas­

sions, to encounter those of his equals, and to depend

for his present safety and future greatness on the

prudence and firmness of his personal conduct. His

destined successors had the misfortune of being born

and educated in the Imperial purple. Incessantly

surrounded with a train of flatterers, they passed

their youth in the enjoyment of luxury and the ex­

pectation of a throne; nor would the dignity of their

rank permit them to descend from that elevated sta­

tion from whence the various characters of human

nature appear to wear a smooth and uniform aspect.

The indulgence of Constantine admitted them, at a

very tender age, to share the administration of the

empire; and they studied the art of reigning at the •

expense of the people intrusted to their care. The

younger Constantine was appointed to hold his court

in Gaul; and his brother Constantius exchanged

that department, the ancient patrimony of their fa­

ther, for the more opulent, but less martial, countries

of the East. Italy, the Western Illyricum, and

Africa, were accustomed to revere Constans, the third

of his sons, as the representative of the great Con­

stantine. He fixed Dalmatius on the Gothic fron­

tier, to which he annexed the government of Thrace,

Macedonia, and Greece. The city of Caesarea was

chosen for the residence of Hannibalianus; and the

provinces of Pontus, Cappadocia, and the Lesser Ar­

menia, were destined to form the extent of his new-

kingdom. For each of these princes a suitable esta­

blishment was provided. A just proportion of guards,

of legions, and of auxiliaries, was allotted for their
