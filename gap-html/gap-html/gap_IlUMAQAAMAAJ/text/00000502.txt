THK DECLINE AND FALL

Gaul and Germany*. But the Moor, who com­

manded the legions of Honorius, was too well ac­

quainted with the manners of his countrymen, to en­

tertain any serious apprehension of a naked and dis­

orderly host of Barbarians; whose left arm, instead

of a shield, was protected only by a mantle; who

were totally disarmed as soon as they had darted their

javelin from their right hand; and whose horses had

never been taught to. bear the control, or to obey

the guidance, of the bridle. He fixed his Camp of

five thousand veterans in the face of a superior enemy,

and, after the delay of three days, gave the signal

of a general engagement. As Mascezel advanced

before the front with fair offers of peace and pardon,

he encountered one of the foremost standard-bearers

of the Africans, and, on his refusal to yield, struck

him on the arm with his sword. The arm, and the

standard, sunk under the weight of the blow; and

the imaginary act of submission was hastily repeated

by all the standards of the line. At this signal, the

disaffected cohorts proclaimed the name of their law­

ful sovereign; the Barbarians, astonished by the de­

fection of their Roman allies, dispersed, according

to their custom, in tumultuary flight; and Mascezel

obtained the honours of an easy, and almost bloodless,

victory. The tyrant escaped from the field of battle

to the sea-shore; and threw himself into a small

vessel, with the hope of reaching in safety some

friendly port of the empire of the East; but the ob­

stinacy of the wind drove him back into the harbour

of Tabraca, which had acknowledged, with the rest

of the province, the dominion of Honorius, and the

authority of his lieutenant. The inhabitants, as a

proof of their repentance and loyalty, seized and con-

* Orosius must be responsible for the account. The presumption of GUdo  
and his various train of Barbarians is celebrated by Claudian (i. Cons Stil .
