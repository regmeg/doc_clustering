xv' revenge would have been coloured with the specious

pretence of justice and fraternal piety. The ex­

ample of suicide was imitated by Decentius, who

strangled himself on the news of his brother's death.

The author of the conspiracy, Marcellinus, had long

since disappeared in the battle of Mursa, and the

public tranquillity was confirmed by the execution of

the surviving leaders of a guilty and unsuccessful

faction. A severe inquisition was extended over all

who, either from choice or from compulsion, had

been involved in the cause of rebellion. Paul, sur-

named Catena, from his superior skill in the judicial

exercise of tyranny, was sent to explore the latent

remains of the conspiracy in the remote province of

Britain. The honest indignation expressed by Mar­

tin, vice prcefect of the island, was interpreted as an

evidence of his own guilt; and the governor was

urged to the necessity of turning against his breast

the sword with which he had been provoked to wound

the Imperial minister. The most innocent subjects

of the West were exposed to exile and confiscation,

to death and torture; and as the timid are always

cruel, the mind of Constantius was inaccessible to

mercy *.
