OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE". 451

that he was not unworthy to reign. He secretly in- chap.

vited the archbishop of Milan to undertake the office XXIL

of a mediator; as the pledge of his sincerity, and

the guardian of his safety. He contrived to apprise

the emperor of the East of his helpless situation; and

he declared, that, unless Theodosius could speedily

march to his assistance, he must attempt to escape

from the palace, or rather prison, of Vienne in Gaul,

where he had imprudently fixed his residence in the

midst of the hostile faction. But the hopes of relief

were distant, and doubtful; and, as every day fur­

nished some new provocation, the emperor, without

strength or counsel, too hastily resolved to risk an

immediate contest with his powerful general. He

received Ai,bogastes on the throne; and, as the count

approached with some appearance of respect, delivered

to him a paper, which dismissed him from all his em­

ployments. "My authority," replied Arbogastes with

insulting coolness, "does not depend on the smilet

"or the frown, of a monarch and he contemptu­

ously threw the paper on the ground. The indig­

nant monarch snatched at the sword of one of the

guards, which he struggled to draw from its scab­

bard; and it was not without some degree of violence

that he was prevented from using the deadly weapon

against his enemy, or against himself. A few days His death,

after this extraordinary quarrel, in which he had ex- Ma^ia.92'

posed his resentment and his weakness, the unfor­

tunate Valentinian was found strangled in his apart­

ment; and some pains were employed to disguise the

manifest guilt of Arbogastes, and to persuade the

world that the death of the young emperor had been

the voluntary effect of his own despair. His body

was conducted with decent pomp to the sepulchre of

Milan; and the archbishop pronounced a funeral

oration to commemorate his virtue and his misfor­

tunes.
