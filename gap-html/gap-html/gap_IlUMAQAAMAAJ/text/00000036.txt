first Caesars was in some measure imitated by the

the harvests of Africa, which had been purchased

Egypt for the benefit of his new capital was applied

of the husbandmen of an industrious province. Some

other regulations of this emperor are less liable to

blame, but they are less deserving, of notice. He

divided Constantinople into fourteen regions or quar­

of Senate, communicated to the citizens the privileges

of Italy, and bestowed on the rising city the title

of Colony, the first and most favoured daughter of

ancient Rome. The venerable parent still maintained
