OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 71

with the vain title of Censor, were named Dalmatius chap.

and Hannibalianus. The two sisters of the great XVl

Constantine, Anastasia and Eutropia, were bestowed

on Optatus and Nepotianus, two senators of noble

birth and of consular dignity. His third sister, Con-

stantia, was distinguished by her pre-eminence of

greatness and of misery. She remained the widow

of the vanquished Licinius; and it was by her in*

treaties, that an innocent boy, the offspring of their

marriage, preserved, for some time, his life, the title

of Caesar, and a precarious hope of the succession.

Besides the females, and the allies of the Flavian

house, ten or twelve males, to whom the language

of modern courts would apply the title of princes of

the blood, seemed, according to the order of their

birth, to be destined either to inherit or to support

the throne of Constantine. But in less than thirty

years, this numerous and increasing family was re­

duced to the persons of Constantius and Julian, who

alone had survived a series of crimes and calamities,

such as the tragic poets have deplored in the devoted

lines of Pelops and of Cadmus.

Crispus, the eldest son of Constantine, and the Virtues of

presumptive heir of the empire, is represented by CnsPus,

impartial historians as an amiable and accomplished

youth. The care of his education, or at least of

his studies, was intrusted to Lactantius, the most

eloquent of the Christians; a preceptor admirably

qualified to form the taste, and to excite the virtues,

of his illustrious disciple. At the age of seventeen,

Crispus was invested with the title of Caesar, and the

administration of the Gallic provinces, where the in­

roads of the Germans gave him an early occasion of

signalizing his military prowess. In the civil war

which broke out soon afterwards, the father and son

divided their powers; and this history has already

celebrated the valour as well as conduct displayed
