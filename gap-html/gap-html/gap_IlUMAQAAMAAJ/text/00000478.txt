THE DECLINE AND FALL

who deplore the increase of luxury, and depravation

of manners, are commonly expressive of their peculiar

temper and situation. There are few observers, who

possess a clear and comprehensive view of the revo­

lutions of society; and who are capable of discover­

ing the nice and secret springs of action, which im­

discouraged the subjects of Theodosius from engaging

in those useful and laborious undertakings which re­

quire an immediate expense, and promise a slow and

distant advantage. The frequent examples of ruin

and desolation tempted them not to spare the remains

of a patrimony, which might, every hour, become the

prey of the rapacious Goth. And the mad prodi­

or a siege, may serve to explain the progress of luxury

amidst the misfortunes and terrors of a sinking nation.

The effeminate luxury, which infected the manners

of courts and cities, had instilled a secret and destruc­

degeneracy has been marked by the pen of a military

writer, who had accurately studied the genuine and

ancient principles of Roman discipline. It is the

just and important observation of Vegetius, that the
