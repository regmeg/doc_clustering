THE DECLINE AND FALL

office of president was exercised by the venerable

praefect of the East, a second Sallust, whose virtues

conciliated the esteem of Greek sophists, and of

Christian bishops. He was assisted by the eloquent

Mamertinus, one of the consuls elect, whose merit is

loudly celebrated by the doubtful evidence of his own

applause. But the civil wisdom of two magistrates

was overbalanced by the ferocious violence of four

generals, Nevitta, Agilo, Jovinus, and Arbetio.

Arbetio, whom the public would have seen with less

surprise at the bar than on the bench, was supposed

to possess the secret of the commission: the armed

and angry leaders of the Jovian and Herculian bands

encompassed the tribunal; and the judges were

alternately swayed by the laws of justice, and by the

clamours of faction.

The chamberlain Eusebius, who had so long abused

the the favour of Constantius, expiated, by an ignomi­

nious death, the insolence, the corruption, and

cruelty of his servile reign. The executions of Paul

and Apodemius (the former of whom was burnt alive)

were accepted as an inadequate atonement by the

widows and orphans of so many hundred Romans,

whom those legal tyrants had betrayed and mur­

dered. But Justice herself (if we may use the pa­

thetic expression of Ammianus*) appeared to weep

over the fate of Ursulus, the treasurer of the empire;

and his blood accused the ingratitude of Julian,

whose distress had been seasonably relieved by the

intrepid liberality of that honest minister. The rage

of the soldiers, whom he had provoked by his indis­

cretion, was the cause and the excuse of his death;

and the emperor, deeply wounded by his own re­

proaches and those of the public, offered some con­

solation to the family of Ursulus, by the restitution

* Ursuli vero nccem ipsa mihi videtur flesse justitia. Libaniuf, who imputes  
his death to the soldiers, attempts to criminate the count of the largesses.
