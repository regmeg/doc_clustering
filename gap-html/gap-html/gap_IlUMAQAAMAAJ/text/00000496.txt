THE DECLINE AND FALL

less than three months the people were informed of

the maxims of the new administration, by a singular

edict, which established the exclusive right of the

treasury over the spoils of Rufinus; and silenced,

under heavy penalties, the presumptuous claims of

the subjects of the Eastern empire, who had been in足

obtained, from the senate of Constantinople, to

declare him an enemy of the republic, and to con足

East. At a time when the only hope of delaying
