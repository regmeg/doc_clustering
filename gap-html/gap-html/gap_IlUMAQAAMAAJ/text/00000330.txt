THE DECLINE AND FALL

Rome and Antioch, was interpreted as the fatal

symptom, either of the displeasure of heaven, or of

the depravity of mankind. Let us not hesitate to

indulge a liberal pride, that, in the present age, the

enlightened part of Europe has abolished a cruel and

odious prejudice, which reigned in every climate of

the globe, and adhered to every system of religious

opinions. The nations, and the sects, of the Roman

the intentional guilt of magic was aggravated by the

actual crimes of treason and sacrilege. Such vain

terrors disturbed the peace of society, and the hap­

piness of individuals; and the harmless flame which

insensibly melted a waxen image, might derive a
