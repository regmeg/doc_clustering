THE DECLINE AND FALL

East, and of praefect of Constantinople, were filled

by Tatian and his son Proculus; whose united autho­

rity balanced, for some time, the ambition and favour

of the master of the offices. The two praefects were

accused of rapine and corruption in the administra­

tion of the laws and finances. For the trial of these

illustrious offenders, the emperor constituted a special

commission; several judges were named to share the

guilt and reproach of injustice; but the right of pro­

nouncing sentence was reserved to the president alone,

and that president was Rufinus himself. The father,

stripped of the praefecture of the East, was thrown

into a dungeon; but the son, conscious that few

ministers can be found innocent, where an enemy is

their judge, had secretly escaped; and Rufinus must

have been satisfied with the least obnoxious victim, if

despotism had not condescended to employ the basest

and most ungenerous artifice. The prosecution was

conducted with an appearance of equity and modera­

tion, which flattered Tatian with the hope of a favour­

able event; his confidence was fortified by the solemn

assurances, and perfidious oaths, of the president, who

presumed to interpose the sacred name of Theodosius

himself; and the unhappy father was at last persuaded

to recall, by a private letter, the fugitive Proculus. He

was instantly seized, examined, condemned, and be­

headed, in one of the suburbs of Constantinople, with

a precipitation which disappointed the clemency of the

emperor. Without respecting the misfortunes of a

consular senator, the cruel judges of Tatian compelled

him to behold the execution of his son: the fatal cord

was fastened round his own neck; but in the moment

when he expected, and perhaps desired, the relief of

a speedy death, he was permitted to consume the

miserable remnant of his old age in poverty and exile.

The punishment of the two praefects might, perhaps,

be excused by the exceptionable parts of their own
