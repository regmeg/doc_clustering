ninety servants, and one hundred and fifty-eight

horses. They were strictly prohibited from inter­

fering in any matter which related to the admini­

stration of justice or the revenue; but the command

which they exercised over the troops of their de­

partment was independent of the authority of the

magistrates. About the same time that Constantine

gave a legal sanction to the ecclesiastical order, he

instituted in the Roman empire the nice balance of

the civil and the military powers. The emulation,

and sometimes the discord, which reigned between

two professions of opposite interests and incompati­

ble manners, was productive of beneficial and of per­

nicious consequences. It was seldom to be expected

that the general and the civil governor of a province

should either conspire for the disturbance, or should

unite for the service of their country. While the

one delayed to offer the assistance which the other

disdained to solicit, the troops very frequently re­

mained without orders or without supplies; the

public safety was betrayed, and the defenceless sub­

jects were left exposed to the fury of the Barbarians.

The divided administration, which had been formed

by Constantine, relaxed the vigour of the state,

while it secured the tranquillity of the monarch.

The memory of Constantine has been deservedly °^enction

censured for another innovation which corrupted troops.

military discipline, and prepared the ruin of the em­

pire. The nineteen years which preceded his final

victory over Licinius had been a period of licence

and intestine war. The rivals who contended for

the possession of the Roman world, had withdrawn

the greatest part of their forces from the guard of

the general frontier; and the principal cities which

formed the boundary of their respective dominions
