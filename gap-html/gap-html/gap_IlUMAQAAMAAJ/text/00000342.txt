THE DECLINE AND FALL

chap. priest, of the nation. The person of the priest was

xx' sacred, and his dignity perpetual; but the temporal

government was held by a very precarious tenure.

If the events of war accused the courage or conduct

of the king, he was immediately deposed; and the

injustice of his subjects made him responsible for the

fertility of the earth, and the regularity of the sea­

sons, which seemed to fall more properly within the

sacerdotal department. The disputed possession of

Alemanni, Macrianus, • who, with a 'Roman name,

had assumed the arts of a soldier and a statesman,

deserved his hatred and esteem. The emperor him­

self, with a light and unincumbered band, conde­
