THE DECLINE AMD FALL

chap. of the fiery eruption or earthquake at Jerusalem, with

!_ saying, "Should these things appear incredible to any

"one, those who have had information from eye-wit-

"nesses, and one yet alive, will confirm it to him."

Basnage objects, that Sozomen does not name any

of these eye-witnesses, or the person who had derived

information from them. In reply to Basnage, it has

been said, that witnesses are seldom named if reference

is made to a multitude of persons who have viewed

and related a public spectacle. He takes no notice

of the three contemporary writers, Ambrose, Chry-

sostom, and Gregory Nazienzen; the last of whom

wrote before the close of the year in which the occur­

rences took place. But, what is still more extraordi­

nary, Mr. Basnage makes no mention of Ammianus

Marcellinus. He entirely overlooks this great pagan

historian, who relates with circumstantial minuteness

the events of the reign of Julian, to the greater part

of which he was an eye-witness, and who certainly was

not influenced by any partiality to the cause of Chris­

tianity.

Bishop Warburton, in his Julian, an elaborate work,

in reply to Basnage, has stated, if I mistake not, every

thing that can be adduced on this subject. He also

quotes some expressions from an epistle of Julian, to

prove that the emperor himself could not help ac­

knowledging the truth of the occurrence. In the

last place, he transcribes a passage from R. Gedaliah

van Joseph Icehajah, a learned Jewish writer, who re­

lates the fact. Even Basnage admits, " que cet aveu

"des Rabbins est d'autant plus considerable qu'il est

"injurieuse a la nation, et que ces messieurs ne sont

"pas accoutum^s a copier les ouvrages des Chretiens,"

Lib. 6. c. 18,19. The learned Abb6 de la Bleterie, in

his life of Julian, (an interesting publication, not un­

favourable to the emperor) relates the circumstances of

the event with great candour, and acknowledges the
