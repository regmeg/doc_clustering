352 THE DECLINE AND FALL

chap. The emperor of the West, who had resigned to

xx' his brother the command of the Lower Danube, re-

War of the served for his immediate care the defence of the Rhae-

Sarma-and tian and Illyrian provinces, which spread so many

ad'.374. hundred miles along the greatest of the European

suaded to accept the pressing invitation of Marcelli-

nus. I am at a loss how to vary the narrative of

similar crimes; or how to relate, that, in the course

of the same year, but in remote parts of the empire,
