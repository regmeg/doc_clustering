OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 93

Romans derived more honour than advantage from chap.

this revolution. Chosroes was a prince of a puny xv'

stature, and a pusillanimous spirit. Unequal to the

fatigues of war, averse to the society of mankind, he

withdrew from his capital to a retired palace, which

valour had almost achieved a signal and decisive vic­

the approach of Sapor, who passed the Tigris over

three bridges, and occupied near the village of Hilleh
