264 THE DECLINE AND FALL

ghap conveyed the waters of the Nahar-Malcha into the

XIX' river Tigris, at some distance above the cities. From

the information of the peasants, Julian ascertained

the vestiges of this ancient work, which were almost

obliterated by design or accident. By the indefatigable

labour of the soldiers, a broad and deep channel was
