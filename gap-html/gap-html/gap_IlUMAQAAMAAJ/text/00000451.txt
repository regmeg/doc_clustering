OF THE 110MAN EMPIRE. 431

of Ambrose; the disinterested advice of Theodosius chap.

was the general result of piety and friendship; and XXI1'

the mask of religious zeal concealed the hostile and

ambitious designs of the tyrant of Gaul.

The reign of Maximus might have ended in peace Maximus

and prosperity, could he have contented himself with itaiy,

the possession of three ample countries, which now August,87

constitute the three most flourishing kingdoms of

modern Europe. But the aspiring usurper, whose

sordid ambition was not dignified by the love of glory

and of arms, considered his actual forces as the in足

struments only of his future greatness, and his suc足

cess was the immediate cause of his destruction.

The wealth which he extorted from the oppressed

provinces of Gaul, Spain, and Britain, was employed

in levying and maintaining a formidable army of

Barbarians, collected, for the most part, from the

fiercest nations of Germany. The conquest of Italy

was the object of his hopes and preparations; and he

secretly meditated the ruin of an innocent youth,

whose government was abhorred and despised by his

Catholic subjects. But as Maximus wished to oc足

cupy, without resistance, the passes of the Alps, he

received, with perfidious smiles, Domninus of Syria,

the ambassador of Valentinian, and pressed him to

accept the aid of a considerable body of troops for

the service of a Pannonian war. The penetration of

Ambrose had discovered the snares of an enemy

under the professions of friendship; but the Syrian

Domninus was corrupted or deceived, by the liberal

favour of the court of Treves; and the council of

Milan obstinately rejected the suspicion of danger,

with a blind confidence, which was the effect, not of

courage, but of fear. The march of the auxiliaries

was guided by the ambassador; and they were ad足

mitted, without distrust, into the fortresses of the Alps.
