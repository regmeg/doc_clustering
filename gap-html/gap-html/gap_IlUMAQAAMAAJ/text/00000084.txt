THE DECLINE AND FALL

example of their sovereign, and to embrace the di足

vine truth of Christianity.

By the edicts of toleration, Constantine removed

the temporal disadvantages which had hitherto re足

tarded the progress of Christianity; and its active

and numerous ministers received a free permission, a

liberal encouragement, to recommend the salutary

truths of revelation by every argument which could

affect the reason or piety of mankind. The exact

balance of the two religions continued but a moment.

The hopes of wealth and honour, the example of an

emperor, and his exhortations, diffused conviction

among the obsequious crowds which usually fill the

apartments of a palace. The cities which signalized

a forward zeal by the voluntary destruction of their

temples were distinguished by municipal privileges,

and rewarded with popular donatives; and the new

capital of the East gloried in the singular advantage,

that Constantinople was never profaned by the wor足

ship of idols.

The powerful influence of Constantine was not

circumscribed by the narrow limits of his life, or of

his dominions. The education which he bestowed

on his sons, and nephews, secured to the empire a

race of princes whose faith was still more lively and

sincere, as they imbibed in their earliest infancy the

doctrines of Christianity. War and commerce had

spread the knowledge of the Gospel beyond the con足

fines of the Roman provinces, and the Barbarians,

who had disdained an humble and proscribed sect,

soon learned to esteem a religion which had been so

lately embraced by the greatest monarch and the

most civilized nation of the globe. The Goths and

Germans who enlisted under the standard of Rome

revered the cross which glittered at the head of the

legions, and their fierce countrymen received at the

same time the lessons of faith and of humanity.
