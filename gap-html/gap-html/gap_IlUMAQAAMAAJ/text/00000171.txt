stock of provisions, which would have been of the

most essential service to the army of Gaul, was an

evidence of his hostile and criminal intentions. The

Germans despised an enemy who appeared destitute

either of power or of inclination to offend them;

and the ignominious retreat of Barbatio deprived

Julian of the expected support; and left him to

extricate himself from a hazardous situation, where

he could neither remain with safety, nor retire with

As soon as they were delivered from the fears of Battle of

session of that country, which they claimed as their

own by the right of conquest and of treaties. They

employed three days, and as many nights, in trans­

porting over the Rhine their military powers. The

fierce Chnodomar, shaking the ponderous javelin,

which he had victoriously wielded against the brother

of Magnentius, led the van of the Barbarians, and

moderated by his experience the martial ardour which

his example inspired. He was followed by six other

kings, by ten princes of regal extraction, by a long
