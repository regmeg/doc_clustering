180 THE DECLINE AND FALL

chap. like their leader, to cast behind them every hope of a

XVIL retreat: at the head of this faithful band, he fear­

lessly plunged into the recesses of the Marcian,. or

black forest, which conceals the sources of the Da­

nube; and, for many days, the fate of Julian was un­

known to the world. The secrecy of his march, his

diligence, and vigour, surmounted every obstacle;

he forced his way over mountains and morasses,

occupied the bridges or swam the rivers, pursued his

direct course, without reflecting whether he traversed

the territory of the Romans or of the Barbarians, and

at length emerged, between Ratisbon and Vienna,

at the place where he designed to embark his troops

on the Danube. By a well-concerted stratagem, he

seized a fleet of light brigantines, as it lay at anchor;

secured a supply of coarse provisions sufficient to

satisfy the indelicate, but voracious, appetite of a

Gallic army; and boldly committed himself to the

stream of the Danube. The labours of his mariners,

who plied their oars with incessant diligence, and the

steady continuance of a favourable wind, carried his

fleet above seven hundred miles in eleven days *;

and he had already disembarked his troops at Bono-

nia, only nineteen miles from Sirmium, before his

enemies could receive any certain intelligence that he

had left the banks of the Rhine. In the course of

this long and rapid navigation, the mind of Julian

was fixed on the object of his enterprise; and though

he accepted the deputation of some cities, which

hastened to claim the merit of an early submission, he

passed before the hostile stations, which were placed

along the river, without indulging the temptation of

signalizing an useless and ill-timed valour. The

banks of the Danube were crowded on either side

with spectators, who gazed on the military pomp,

* Zosimus alone (1. iii. p. 156.) has specified this interesting circumstance.
