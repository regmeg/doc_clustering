human nature; and their minds and bodies were so

completely hardened by perpetual action, that, ac­

of that severe season they sustained, with inflexible

constancy, a siege of fifty-four days; till at length,

exhausted by hunger, and satisfied that the vigilance

of the enemy in breaking the ice of the river left

them no hopes of escape, the Franks consented, for

the first time, to dispense with the ancient law which

commanded them to conquer or to die. The Caesar

immediately sent his captives to the court of Con-

stantius, who accepting them as a valuable present,

rejoiced in the opportunity of adding so many heroes

to the choicest troops of his domestic guards. The

obstinate resistance of this handful of Franks ap­

which he meditated for the ensuing spring, against

the whole body of the nation. His rapid diligence

surprised and astonished the active Barbarians. Or­

dering his soldiers to provide themselves with biscuit

for twenty days, he suddenly pitched his camp near

Tongres, while the enemy still supposed him in his

winter quarters of Paris, expecting the slow arrival

of his convoys from Aquitain. Without allowing

the Franks to unite or to deliberate, he skilfully
