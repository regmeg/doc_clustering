350 THE DECLINE AND FALL

chap. cline and fall of the empire. Instead of leading the

xx nations of Germany and Scythia to the banks of the

Danube, or even to the gates of Constantinople, the

aged monarch of the Goths resigned to the brave

Athanaric the danger and glory of a defensive war,

against an enemy, who wielded with a feeble hand

the powers of a mighty state. A bridge of boats was

masters-general of the cavalry and infantry. The

operations of the campaign were conducted by their

large reward for the head of every Goth that was

brought into the Imperial camp. The submission

of the Barbarians appeased the resentment of Valens

and his council; the emperor listened with satisfac­
