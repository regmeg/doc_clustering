OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 139

On his left hand, the place of honour among the

Orientals, Grumbates,' king of the Chionites, dis- xvi.

played the stern countenance of an aged and re- *

nowned warrior. The monarch had reserved a similar

place on his right hand for the king of the Albanians,

who led his independent tribes from the shores of the

Caspian. The satraps and generals were distributed

according to their several ranks, and the whole army,

besides the numerous train of Oriental luxury, con足

Euphrates, and press forwards without delay to seize .

the feeble and wealthy metropolis of Syria. But the

Persians were no sooner advanced into the plains of

Mesopotamia, than they discovered that every pre足

their cattle, were secured in places of strength, the

green forage throughout the country was set on fire,

military engines were planted on the opposite banks,

and a seasonable swell of the waters of the Euphrates

deterred the Barbarians from attempting the ordinary

passage of the bridge of Thapsacus. Their skilful

guide, changing his plan of operations, then con足

ducted the army by a longer circuit, but through a

fertile territory, towards the head of the Euphrates,

where the infant river is reduced to a shallow and

accessible stream. Sapor overlooked,, with prudent

disdain, the strength of Nisibis; but as he passed

under the walls of Amida, he resolved to try whether

the majesty of his presence would not awe the garrison
