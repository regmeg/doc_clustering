the testimony of Ammianus, and the three Christian

fathers, he thinks, as Warburton does, that he finds an

acknowledgment of the fact in the very words of Julian,

which have been already quoted. La Bleterie adds,

"Ces paroles, dans la bouche d'un souverain, ressem-

"blent bien a l'aveu d'une entreprise manquee."

He afterwards quotes the same Jewish writer as Bas-

Jewish, and Christian historians, and having observed

that it is not denied by any contemporary writer, La

Bleterie sums up the whole with saying, " qu'il-n'y-a

remarkable event, without presuming to offer any opi­

avoided entering into any controversy, yet I cannot

help taking notice of one argument (almost the only

argument) which is urged by Mr. Gibbon against

the authority of Ammianus. He says, "that at the

he speaks of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions

in various places; and the plain simplicity of his

narrative might rather induce a belief, that he con­
