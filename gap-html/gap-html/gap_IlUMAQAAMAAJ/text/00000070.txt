THE DECLINE AND FALL

accomplices, or even as the witnesses, perhaps, of

an imaginary crime, perpetually hung over the heads

of the principal citizens of the Roman world.

These evils, however terrible they may appear,

were confined to the smaller number of Roman sub­

compensated by the enjoyment of those advantages,

either of nature or of fortune, which exposed them

to the jealousy of the monarch. The obscure mil­

lions of a great empire have much less to dread from

the cruelty than from the avarice of their masters;

and their humble happiness is principally affected

by the grievance of excessive taxes, "which, gently

pressing on the wealthy, descend with accelerated

weight on the meaner and more indigent classes of

society. An ingenious philosopher * has calculated

the universal measure of the public impositions by

the degrees of freedom and servitude; and ventures

to assert, that, according to an invariable law of

nature, it must always increase with the former, and

diminish in a just proportion to the latter. But this

reflection, which would tend to alleviate the miseries

of despotism, is contradicted at least by the history

of the Roman empire; which accuses the same

princes of despoiling the senate of its authority, and

the provinces of their wealth. Without abolishing

all the various customs and duties on merchandizes,

which are imperceptibly discharged by the apparent

choice of the purchaser, the policy of Constantine

and his successors preferred a simple and direct

mode of taxation, more congenial to the spirit of an

arbitrary government.

The name and use of the indict ions, which serve
