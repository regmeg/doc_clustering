OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

pro virium explicavi mensura. Opus veritatem pro-

fessum nunquam (ut arbitror) sciens silentio ausus

corrumpere vel mendacio. Scribant reliqua potiores

astate doctrinis florentes. Quos id (si libuerit) aggres-

suros, procudere linguas ad majores moneo stylos."

Mr. Gibbon, when he afterwards is taking leave

of his accurate and faithful guide, observes with re­

gret, that the rising generation was not disposed to

accept the advice, or imitate the example, of this ex­

cellent historian, who had composed the history of

his own times, without indulging the prejudices and

passions which usually affect the mind of a contem­

porary. I will venture to add, that the person who

reads Ammianus, will feel in many parts of his works

that peculiar interest, which seldom fails to be ex­

cited by the writings of an author, who was an eye­

witness of the scenes which he was employed in

describing.
