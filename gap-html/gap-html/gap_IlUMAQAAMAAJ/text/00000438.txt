418 THE DECLINE AND FALL

chap. seem to share the guilt, of the assassin. Even the

XXIL principles of justice, and the interest of society, would

receive a fatal blow from the impunity of Maximus:

and the example of successful usurpation would tend

to dissolve the artificial fabric of government, and

once more to re-plunge the empire in the crimes and

calamities of the preceding age. But, as the senti­

ments of gratitude and honour should invariably re­

gulate the conduct of an individual, they may be

overbalanced in the mind of a sovereign, by the sense

of superior duties: and the maxims both of justice

and humanity must permit the escape of an atrocious

criminal, if an innocent people would be involved in

the consequences of his punishment. The assassin

of Gratian had usurped, but he actually possessed,

the most warlike provinces of the empire: the East

was exhausted by the misfortunes, and even by the

success, of the Gothic war; and it was seriously to

be apprehended, that, after the vital strength of the

republic had been wasted in a doubtful and destruc­

tive contest, the feeble conqueror would remain an

easy prey to the Barbarians of the North. These

weighty considerations engaged Theodosius to dis­

semble his resentment, and to accept the alliance of

the tyrant. But he stipulated, that Maximus should

content himself with the possession of the countries be­

yond the Alps. The brother of Gratian was confirmed

and secured in the sovereignty of Italy, Africa, and the

Western Illyricum; and some honourable conditions

were inserted in the treaty, to protect the memory,

and the laws, of the deceased emperor. According

to the custom of the age, the images of the three

Imperial colleagues were exhibited to the veneration

of the people : nor should it be lightly supposed, that,

in the moment of a solemn reconciliation, Theodosius

secretly cherished the intention of perfidy and revenge.
