districts. The ponderous volumes of the Codes and

Pandects would furnish ample materials for a minute

inquiry into the system of provincial government, as

in the space of six centuries it was improved by the

wisdom of the Roman statesmen and lawyers. It

may be sufficient for the historian to select two sin­

gular and salutary provisions intended to restrain

the abuse of authority. 1. For the preservation of

peace and order, the governors of the provinces were

armed with the sword of justice. They inflicted

corporal punishments, and they exercised, in capital

offences, the power of life and death. But they

were not authorised to indulge the condemned cri­

minal with the choice of his own execution, or

to pronounce a sentence of the mildest and most ho­

nourable kind of exile. These prerogatives were

reserved to the pracfects, who alone could impose the

heavy fine of fifty pounds of gold: their vicegerents

were confined to the trifling weight of a few ounces.

This distinction, which seems to grant the larger,

while it denies the smaller degree of authority, was

founded on a very rational motive. The smaller

degree was infinitely more liable to abuse. The

passions of a provincial magistrate might frequently

provoke him into acts of oppression, which affected

only the freedom or the fortunes of the subject;

though, from a principle of prudence, perhaps of

humanity, he might still be terrified by the guilt of

innocent blood. It may likewise be considered, that

exile, considerable fines, or the choice of an easy

death, relate more particularly to the rich and the

noble; and the persons the most exposed to the avarice

or resentment of a provincial magistrate were thus

removed from his obscure persecution to the more

august and impartial tribunal of the Praetorian prae-
