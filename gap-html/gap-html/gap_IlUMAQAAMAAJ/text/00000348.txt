of shepherds and hunters; and as they seldom were

fixed to any permanent habitation, they acquired the

expressive name of Scots, which,' in the Celtic

tongue, is said to be equivalent to that of wanderers,

or vagrants. The inhabitants of a barren land were

urged to seek a fresh supply of food in the waters.

The deep lakes and bays which intersect their coun­

try are plentifully stored with fish; and they gra­

dually ventured to cast their nets in the waves of the

ocean. The vicinity of the Hebrides, so profusely

scattered along the western coast of Scotland, tempted

their curiosity, and improved their skill; and they

acquired, by slow degrees, the art, or rather the

habit, of managing their boats in a tempestuous sea,

and of steering their nocturnal course by the light of

the well-known stars. The two bold headlands of

Caledonia almost touch the shores of a spacious

island, which obtained, from its luxuriant vegetation,

the epithet of Green; and has preserved, with a

slight alteration, the name of Erin, or Ierne, or Ire­

land. It is probable, that, in some remote period of

antiquity, the fertile plains of Ulster received a colony

of hungry Scots; and that the strangers of the North,

who had dared to encounter the arms of the legions,

spread their conquests over the savage and unwarlike

natives of a solitary island. It is certain, that, in the

declining age of the Roman empire, Caledonia, Ire­

land, and the Isle of Man, were inhabited by the Scots,

and that the kindred tribes, who were often asso­

the various accidents of their mutual fortunes. They

long cherished the lively tradition of their common

name and origin; and the missionaries of the Isle of

Saints, who diffused the light of Christianity over

North Britain, established the vain opinion, that
