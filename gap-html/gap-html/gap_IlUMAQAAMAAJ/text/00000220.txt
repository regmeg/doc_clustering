of Elis, of Delphi, and of Argos, which had inherited

from their remote ancestors the sacred office of per足

Elis and Delphi was respected by the Corinthians;

but the poverty of Argos tempted the insolence of

oppression; and the feeble complaints of its deputies

superior tribunal; and his eloquence was interposed,

most probably with success, in the defence of a city,

which had been the royal seat of Agamemnon, and

had given to Macedonia a race of kings and con足

in a school of declamation, the several modes of

praise, of censure, of exhortation; and his friend

Libanius has remarked, that the study of Homer
