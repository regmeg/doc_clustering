HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK IX. 96

Romans, if they had happened to have been engaged

in a war with Alexander. The circumstances of

war with Carthage, and had come into Italy at a more

advanced period of life. Every one of these possessed

powers of mind, and a capacity equal with Alexander:

add to this that a regular system of military discipline

had been transmitted from one to another, from the
