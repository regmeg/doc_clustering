HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK VIII. 6

violence, that he received a contusion on his head

which deprived him of sense. As all the authors do

not concur in mentioning his death to have ensued, I,

for my part, must leave that circumstance in doubt; as

I shall another, of a violent storm, with dreadful noise

gods concerning the infraction of the treaties: for, as

these accounts may possibly be founded in fact, so may

their sleep, the same figure of a man, of a form larger,

and more majestic, than the human, who said to them,
