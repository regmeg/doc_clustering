Chap. 1. The year following [A.U.C. 433. B.C. 319]

was distinguished by the convention of Caudium, so

memorable on account of the misfortune of the Ro­

in to judge of your resentment, and of my punishment ?

I decline none; neither nation nor private person. But

if the weak is not to find protection against a stronger

in human laws, I will appeal to the gods, the avengers

of intolerable arrogance, and will beseech them to turn
