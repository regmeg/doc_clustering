LIVY.

[Here ten books of the original are lost, mating a chasm of

seventy-five years. The translator's object being, to pub­

lish the work of Livy only, he has not thought it his duty

to attempt to supply this deficiency, either by a compilation

of his own, or by transcribing or translating those of others.

The reader, however, who may be desirous of knowing the

events which took place during this interval, will find as

complete a detail of them as can now be given in Hooke's-

or RoUin's Roman History.

The contents of the lost books have been preserved, and

are as follows:—]
