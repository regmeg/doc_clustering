fortune. A continual fall of rain spread such an inun­

dation over all the plains, as cut off from the three

separate divisions of the army all communication. In

this state, the two parties, in neither of which the king

was present, were suddenly attacked and overpowered

by the enemy, who, after putting them to the sword, em­

ployed their whole force in blockading the post where

Alexander commanded in person. From this place the

Lucanian exiles sent emissaries to their countrymen,

and, stipulating a safe return for themselves, promised

him with a javelin: after his fall, the current carried

down his lifeless body, with the weapon sticking in it, to

the posts of the enemy : there it was mangled in a man­

they sent one half to Consentia, and kept the other, as
