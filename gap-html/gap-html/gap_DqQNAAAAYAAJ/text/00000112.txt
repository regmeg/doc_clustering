constituted by the successes of a little more than ten

years ; and those who give it pre-eminence on account

that the Roman people have been defeated, though not

in any intire war, yet in several battles, whereas Alex­

ander was never once unsuccessful in fight, do not

consider that they are comparing the actions of one

man, and that a young man, with the course of action

stakes of equal consequence pledged on the issue.

Nay, the hazard had been greater on his side; be­

cause the Macedonians would have had but one Alex­

ander, who was not only liable, but fond of exposing
