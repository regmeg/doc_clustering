ceedings were then directed towards Rome: by con­

struing the order of the senate to have meant that in­

quiry should be made, not specially who at Capua,

but generally, who at any place had formed cabals

or conspiracies; for that cabals, for the attaining of

honors were contrary to the edicts of the state. The

inquiry was extended to a greater latitude, with re­

spect bQth to the matter, and to the kind of persons

concerned. The dictator scrupled not to avow that

his power of research was unlimited : in consequence,

some of the nobility were called to account; and

though they applied to the tribunes for protection, no

one interposed iu their behalf, or to prevent the charges

the way to honors lay open if not obstructed by fraud,

but against the new men: so that even the dictator

and master of the horse, with respect to that question,

would appear more properly as culprits than inquisi­

was more solicitous about his character than his office,

that he advanced into the assembly and spoke to this

effect: ' Romans, of my past life you are all wit­

on me is in itself a testimony of my innocence. For

the dictator, proper to be chosen for holding these in­

quiries, was not, as on many other occasions, where the

exigences of the state so required, the man who was

most renowned in war; but him whose course of life

was most remote from such cabals. But certain of the

nobility (for what reason it is more proper that you

should judge, than that I, as a magistrate should, with­

out proof, insinuate) have labored to stifle intirely the

inquiries ; and then, finding their strength unequal to

it, rather than stand a trial, have fled for refuge to the

stronghold of their adversaries, an appeal, and the

support of the tribunes; and on being there also re­
