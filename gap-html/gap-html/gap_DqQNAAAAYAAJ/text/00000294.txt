sent forward my cavalry, and moved my camp to the:

Rhone. In a battle fought by the cavalry, the only

part of my forces which had an opportunity of fight"

to the Roman people. Wherefore, soldiers, I wish

that you may fight, not only with the same spirit which

you usually show against other foes, but with a degree

of resentment and indignation, as if you saw your own

slaves suddenly taking arms against you. We might
