HISTORY OF ROME. BOOK VIM.

turning home, the Roman army was immediately with­

drawn from thence, after receiving a year's pay for the

soldiers, and corn for three months; which were the

conditions stipulated by the consul on his granting

them a truce until the ambassadors should return.

The Samnites marched against the Sidicinians with

the same troops which they had employed in the Ro­

would not, besides, suffer them to be conquered by such

a union of dastardly nations. That they would, by

their sovereign authority, oblige the Latines and Cam­
