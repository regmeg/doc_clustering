HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK X. 155

then four augurs and four pontiffs, and it had heen de­

termined that the number of priests should be aug­

mented, the four additional pontiffs and five augurs

should all be chosen out of the commons. How the

college of augurs could be reduced to the number of

four, except by the death of two, I do not understand ;

for it is a rule among the augurs that their number

should be composed of threes, so that the three ancient

tribes, the Ramnes, Titienses, and Luceres, should

have each its own augur; or, in case there should be

occasion for more, that each should increase its num­

made up the number nine, so that there were three to

each tribe. However, as it was proposed that they

should be chosen out of the commons, the patricians

were as highly offended at the proceeding as when

they saw the consulship made common ; yet they pre­

their not making a vigorous opposition was, that they

were now accustomed to suffer defeat in such kind of

disputes ; and they saw their adversaries, not as for­

hope to reach, the higher honors; but already in pos­

session of all those advantages, on the uncertain pros­

pect of which they had maintained the contest, mani­

cipally by Appius Claudius and Publius Decius Mus.

After these had urged nearly the same topics respect­

ing the privileges of patricians and plebeians, which

had been formerly employed for and against the Lici-

nian law, when the proposition was brought forward

of opening the consulship to plebeians, Decius is said

to have drawn a lively description of his own father,
