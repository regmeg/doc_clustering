camped in the widest valley which he could find, where

the whole circuit around consisted of rocks and pre­

cipices. Then, having gained intelligence by means

of the same Gauls, (who differed not much from the

others in language or manners, and who had entered

into conversation with them,) that the pass was blocked

up only by day, and that at night they separated to

their several dwellings, he advanced at the first dawn

to the eminences, as if with the design of forcing his

affrighted horses, it was imagined that, to augment in

any degree the terror under which they already la­

bored, were effectually to destroy them: they there­
