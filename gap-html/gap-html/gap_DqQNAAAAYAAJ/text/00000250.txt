prudent, lest, while be procrastinated, some unforeseen

event might disconcert his design, as had been the case

of his father Hamilcar, and afterwards of Hasdrobal,

he determined to make war on the Saguntines: and,

as an attack, on them would certainly call forth the

Roman arms, be first led his army into the territory of

the Olcadians, a nation beyond the Iberus; which,

though within the boundaries of the Carthaginians,

was not under their dominion, in order that he might

not seem to have aimed directly at the Saguntines, but

to be drawn on into a war with them by a series of

fighting, and encamped on the bank; then, as soon as

the enemy afforded him an opportunity, he crossed the

river by a ford, and carried his rampart to such a dis­

pass over, resolving to attack them in their passage.

He gave orders to his cavalry, that as soon as they
