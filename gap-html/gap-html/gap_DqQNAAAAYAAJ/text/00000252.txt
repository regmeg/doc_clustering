likely to be productive of war, were industriously fo­

mented between them and their neighbors, particularly

the Turdetans: and the cause of these latter being

espoused by the same persons who first sowed the

seeds of the contention, and plain proofs appearing that

not an amicable discussion of rights, but open force,

was the means intended to be used,- the Saguntines

despatched ambassadors to Rome to implore assistance

in the war, which evidently threatened them with im­

mediate danger. The consuls at Rome, at that time,

were Publius Cornelius Scipio and Tiberius Sempro-

nius Longus; who, after having introduced the ambas­

sadors to the senate, proposed that the state of the public

affairs should be taken into consideration. It was re­

solved that ambassadors should be sent into Spain, to

inspect the affairs of the allies ; instructed, if they saw

sufficient reason, to warn Hannibal not to molest the

Saguntines, the confederates of the Roman people ; and

also to pass over into Africa, to represent at Carthage

the complaints of these to the Romans. After this em­

bassy had been decreed, and before it was despatched,

news arrived, which no one had expected so soon, that

Saguntum was besieged. The business was then laid

in tire before the senate, as if no resolution had yet

passed. Some were of opinion that the affair should

be prosecuted with vigorous exertions, both by sea and

land, and proposed that Spain and Africa should be

decreed as the provinces of the consuls : others wished

to direct the whole force of their arms against Spain

and Hannibal; while many thought that it would be

imprudent to engage hastily in a matter of so great

importance, and that they ought to wait for the return

of the ambassadors from Spain. This opinion being

deemed the safest, was adopted ; and the ambassadors,

Publius Valerius Flaccus and Quintus Baebius Tam-

philus, were on that account despatched, with the

greater speed, to Saguntum, to Hannibal; and, in case

of his refusing to desist from hostilities, from thence

to Carthage, to insist on that, general being delivered

up to atone for the infraction of the treaty.
