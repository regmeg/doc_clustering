miles distant, and Papirius constantly consulted his

absent colleague, on every thing which he undertook,

while Carvilius, on his part, directed a greater share

of his attention to Aquilonia, where the state of affairs

was more critical and important than to Cominium,

the most powerful efforts of the Samnites ; and should

bring home spoils, of such beauty, as to serve for

ornaments to the public places. The immortal gods

were certainly on his side, on account of the leagues

so often solicited and so often broken. Besides, if a
