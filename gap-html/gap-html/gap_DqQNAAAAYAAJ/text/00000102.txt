not even daring to retreat to their camp, but dis­

persing, made the best of their way towards Apulia:

afterwards, however, they collected their forces into

one body and came to Luceria. The same exaspera­

tion which had carried the Romans through the midst

of the enemy's line carried them forward also into

their camp, where greater carnage was made, and

more blood spilt than even in the field, while the

greater part of the spoil was destroyed in their rage.

Every kind of supplies was brought to the Romans

from Arpi, but in a very scanty proportion, the horsemen

carrying corn from thence to the camp in little bags for

the enemy, when they were obliged to throw the corn

from off their horses, in order to fight. With respect

to the Samnites, before the arrival of the other consul

and his victorious army, provisions and reinforcements

had been brought in to them from the mountains;

but the coming of Publilius strengthened the Romans

in every part; for, committing the siege to the care of
