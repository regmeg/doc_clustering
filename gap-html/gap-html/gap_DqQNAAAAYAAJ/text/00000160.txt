of the senate, that no person should dedicate a temple,

or an altar, without an order from the senate, or from

a majority of the plebeian tribunes. The incident which

I am about to mention would be trivial in itself, were

it not an instance of the freedom assumed by plebeians

in opposition to the pride of the nobles: Flavins coming

to make a visit to his colleague, who was sick, some

young nobles who were sitting there agreed among

themselves not to pay him the compliment of rising at

forum, and threw it into four, which he ordered to be

called city tribes. And this procedure, we are told,
