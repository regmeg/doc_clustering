40 LIVY.

the ambassadors of the Romans replied,' that they would

go, not whither their enemy called, but whither their

commanders should lead.' In the mean time, Publi-

lius, by seizing an advantageous post between Palaepo-

lis and Nea'polis, had cut off the confederates from that

interchange of mutual aid, which they had hitherto af­

forded each other, when either place was pressed. The

day of the elections approached ; and, as it was highly

inexpedient that Publilius should be recalled, when on

the point of assailing the enemy's walls, and in daily

expectation of gaining possession of their city, appli­

cation was made to the tribunes, to recommend to the

people the passing of an order, that Publilius Philo,

when his year of office should expire, might continue

in command as proconsul until the war with the Greeks

should be finished. A letter was despatched to Lucius

Cornelius, with orders to name a dictator; for it was

not thought proper that the consul should be recalled

while he was employed in vigorously prosecuting the

business of the campaign, and had already carried the

war into Samnium. He nominated Marcus Claudius

Marcellus, who appointed Spurius Postumius master

of the horse. The elections, however, were not held

by the dictator, because the regularity of his appoint­

ment was called in question ; and the augurs being

consulted, pronounced that it appeared defective. The

tribunes inveighed against this proceeding, as dangerous

and dishonorable ; ' for it was not probable,' they said,

' that a fault in the appointment could have been dis­

covered, as the consul, rising in the night, had nomi­

nated the dictator in private, and while every thing was

still;1 nor had the said consul, in any of his letters,

either public or private, made any mention of such a

thing; nor did any person whatever appear, who said

that he saw or heard any thing which could vitiate the

auspices. Neither could the augurs, sitting at Rome,

divine what inauspicious circumstance had occurred to

1 Any noise happening during the taking of the auspice

was reckpned inauspicious.
