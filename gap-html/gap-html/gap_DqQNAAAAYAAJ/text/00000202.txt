was consequently attacked on the rear, and surrounded

by several battalions, who pressed it on all sides.

Some writers say that the whole were cut off, so that

not one survived to give an account of the disaster;

and that no information of the misfortune reached the

consuls, who were at the time not far from Clusium,

until the Gallic horsemen came within vsight, carrying

the heads of the slain ; some hanging before their

horses' breasts, others on the points of their spears,

and expressing their triumph in songs, according to

their custom. Others affirm that the defeat was by

Umbrians, not Gauls, and that the loss sustained was

not so great: that a party of foragers, under Lucius

Manlius Torquatus, lieutenant-general, being sur­

Sentinum, and pitched their camp distant from them

about four miles. Several councils were then held by

the enemy, and their plan of operations was thus set­

tled : that they should not encamp together, nor go

out together to battle: the Gauls were united to the

Sammies; the Umbrians to the Etrurians. The day
