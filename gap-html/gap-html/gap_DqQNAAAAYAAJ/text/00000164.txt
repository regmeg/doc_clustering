which dreaded the unknown sands and flats more than

they did the Romans, and which showed a greater

eagerness to escape into the deep, than to make re­

sistance. The soldiers pursued them as far as the

' mouth of the river; and having taken and burned a

part of the fleet, which, in the hurry and confusion, had

been stranded, returned victorious. Cleonymus, hav­

ing met success in no part of the Adriatic sea, de­

parted with scarce a fifth part of his navy remaining.

Many, now alive, have seen the beaks of his ships,

and the spoils of the Lacedaemonians, hanging in the

old temple of Juno. In commemoration of this event

there is exhibited at Patavium, every year on its an­

niversary day, a naval combat on the river in the

middle of the town.

3. A treaty was this year concluded at Rome with

the Vestinians, who solicited friendship. Various

causes of apprehension afterwards sprung up. News

arrived that Etruria was in rebellion the insurrec­

tion having arisen from the dissentions of the Arre-

tians; for the Cilnian family having grown exorbi­

tantly powerful, a party, out of envy of their wealth,

had attempted to expel them by force of arms. Ac­

counts were also received that the Marsians held

forcible possession of the lands to which the colony of

Carseoli, consisting of four thousand men, had been

sent. By reason therefore of these commotions Mar­

cus Valerius Maximus was nominated dictator, and

chose for his master of the horse Marcus /Emilius

Paullus. This I am inclined to believe, rather than

that Quintus Fabius, at such an age as he then was,

and after enjoying many honors, was placed in a sta­

tion subordinate to Valerius: but I think it not un­

likely that the mistake arose from the surname Maxi­

mus. The dictator, taking the field at the head of an

army, in one battle utterly defeated the Marsians,

drove them into their fortified towns, and afterwards,

in {be course of a few days, took Milionia, Plestina,

and Fresilia; and then fining this people in a part

of their lands, granted them a renewal of the treaty.
