ment for being deprived of their lands, were defeated

and driven out of their camp in the plains of Ferenti-

num ; and while Publilius, under whose conduct and

auspices the battle had been fought, was employed

there in receiving the submissions of the Latine states,

who had lost the greater part of their young men in

the engagement, jEmilius led the army towards Pe­

dum. The people of this city were supported by the

Tiburtine, Praenestine, and Veliternian states : auxili­

aries also came to them from Lavinium and Antium.

Though the Romans had here the superiority in seve­

ral engagements, yet the most difficult part of the bu­

siness remained still to be attempted at the city of Pe­

dum itself, and at the camp of the combined states,

which lay close to the walls; when the consul, on

Rome to demand a triumph for himself before he had

obtained a victory. The senate, offended at his ambi­

which his colleague, who was himself a plebeian, took

no pains to prevent. The charges he brought against

them were grounded on a scanty distribution of the

Latine and Falernian lands: and when the senate,

wishing to put an end to the administration of the con­

suls, ordered a dictator to be nominated to conduct the

war against the Latines, who were again in arms,

jEmilius, who was the acting consul at the time, nomi­

nated his colleague dictator, who appointed Junius Bru­

tus master of the horse. The dictatorship of Publilius

was popular, for his discourses were replete with invec­

tives against the patricians. He at the same time passed

three laws, highly advantageous to the commons, and

injurious to the nobility : one, that the orders of the

commons should bind all the Romans; another, that
