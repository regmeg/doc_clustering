through all parts of that country ; until, at last, he

drove the army of the Samnites, which never dared to

face him in the field, intirely out of the country. Thus

expelled from home, they bent their route to Etruria ;

and supposing that the business, which they had often

in vain endeavored to accomplish by embassies, might

now be negotiated with more effect, when they were

backed by such a powerful armed force, and could in­
