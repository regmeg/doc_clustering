through the Caudine forks. The nature of the place is

this: there are two deep glens, narrow, and covered

with wood, connected together by mountains ranging

on both sides from one to the other; between these lies

a plain of considerable extent, abounding in grass and

water, and through the middle of which the passage

runs: but before this is arrived at the first defile must

be passed, while the only way back, is through the road

by which it was entered ; or if in case of resolving to

proceed forward, it must be by the other glen, which

is still more narrow and difficult. Into this plain the

Romans marched down their troops, by one of those

passes through the cleft of a rock; and, when they ad­

vanced to the other defile, found it blocked up by trees

thrown across, with a mound of huge stones. The

stratagem of the enemy now became apparent; and at

the same time a body of troops was seen on the emi­

nence over the glen. Hastening back, then, to the

road by which they had entered, they found that also

shut up by such another fence, and men in arms. Then,

without orders they halted ; amazement took possession

of their minds, and a strange kind of numbness of their

limbs: they then remained a long time motionless and

silent, with their eyes fixed on each other, as if each

thought the other more capable of judging and advising

than himself. After some time the consul's pavilions

were erected, and they got ready the implements for

throwing up works, although they were sensible that it

must appear ridiculous to attempt raising a fortification

in their present desperate condition, and when almost

every hope was lost. Yet not to add a fault to their

misfortunes, they all without being advised or ordered

by any one, set earnestly to work, and inclosed a camp

with a rampart, close to the water, while themselves,

besides enduring the haughty taunts of their enemies,

seemed with melancholy to acknowlege the apparent

fruitlessness of their labor. The lieutenants-general

and tribunes, without being summoned to consultation,

(for there was no room for either consultation or re­

medy,) assembled round the dejected consul; while the
