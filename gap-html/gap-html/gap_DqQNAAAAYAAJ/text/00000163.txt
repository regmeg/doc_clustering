HISTORTf OF ROME.—BOOK X. 149

country, and being informed that a narrow beach

stretched along the shore, beyond which were marshes,

overflowed by the tides ; that dry land was seen at no

great distance, level in the nearest part, and rising be­

hind into hills, beyond which was the mouth of a very

deep river, into which they had seen ships brought

round and moored in safety, (this was the river Me-

duacus,) he ordered his fleet to sail into it and go up

against the stream. As the channel would not admit

the heavy ships, the troops, removing into the lighter

vessels, arrived at a part of the country occupied by

three maritime cantons of the Patavians, settled on

that coast. Here they made a descent, leaving a small

guard with the ships, made themselves masters of these

cantons, set fire to the houses, drove oft' a considerable

booty of men and cattle, and allured by the sweets of

plunder, proceeded still farther from the shore. When

news of this was brought to Patavium, where the con­

arms, they divided their young men into two bands,

one of which was led towards the quarter where the

marauders were said to be busy; the other by a dif­

ferent route, to avoid meeting any of the pirates, to­

from the town. These attacked the small craft, and

killing the guards, compelled the affrighted mariners

to remove their ships to the other bank of the river.

By land also, the attack on the dispersed plunderers

was equally successful; and the Grecians, flying back

towards their ships, were opposed in their way by the

Venetians. Thus inclosed on both sides, they were

cut to pieces ; and some who were made prisoners

gave information that the fleet, with their king Cleo-

nymus, was but three miles distant. Sending the cap­

tives into the nearest canton to be kept under a guard,

some soldiers got on board the flat-bottomed vessels,

so constructed for the purpose of passing the shoals

with ease ; others threw themselves into those which

had been lately taken from the enemy, and proceeding

down the river, surrounded their unwieldy ships,
