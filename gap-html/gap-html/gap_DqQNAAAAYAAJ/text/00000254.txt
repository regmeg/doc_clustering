forepart of the thigh with a heavy javelin, and falling

in consequence of it, such consternation and dismay

wound was under cure, there was rather a blockade

than a siege. But although during this time there was

a cessation of arms, there was no intermission of the

preparations, either for attack or defence. Hostilities

therefore commenced anew with a greater degree of

necessary to render him master of the place; the Sa­
