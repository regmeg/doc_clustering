your own army, as well as of the senate, I call you

before a judge who must certainly be allowed, though

no other should, to possess more power and authority

than yourself, though dictator. It shall be seen whe­

Hostilius, a Roman king, submitted.' They proceeded

directly from the senate-house to the assembly; where,

having arrived, the dictator attended by few, the mas­

of Lucius Furius, who, in contempt of his great age

and authority, had fought a battle, the issue of which

was dishonorable in the last degree, not only restrained

his anger at the time, so as to write no unfavorable re­
