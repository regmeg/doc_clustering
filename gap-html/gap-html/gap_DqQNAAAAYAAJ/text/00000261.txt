HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK XXI. 247

have presented myself before you, as I would not ap­

pear in the character either of a deputy from Hannibal,

or of a deserter. But since he has remained with your

enemy, either through his own fault, or yours : through

his own, if he counterfeited fear; through yours, if he

who tells you truth is to be punished : I have come to

you, out of my regard to the ties of hospitality so long

subsisting between us, in order that you should not be

ignorant that there are certain conditions on which you

may obtain both peace and safety. Now, that what I

say is merely out of regard to your interest, and not

from any other motive, this alone is sufficient proof:

that, so long as you were able to maintain a defence by

your own strength, or so long as you had hopes of suc­

cor from the Romans, I never once mentioned peace to

you. Now, when you neither have any hopes from

the Romans, nor can rely for defence either on your

arms or walls, I bring you terms of peace, rather

unavoidable than favorable. And there may be some

chance of carrying these into effect, on this condition,

that, as Hannibal dictates them, in the spirit of a con­

queror, so you should listen to them with the spirit of

men conquered : that you consider not what you part

with as loss, for all things are the property of the victor,

but whatever is left to you as a gift. The city, a great

part of which is already demolished, and almost the

whole of which he has in his possession, he takes from

you : your lands he leaves to you, intending to assign

a place where you may build a new town: all your

gold and silver, both public and private property, he

orders to be brought to him : your persons, with those

of your wives and children, he preserves inviolate, pro­

vided you are satisfied to quit Saguntum without arms,

and with single garments. These are the terms which,

as a victorious enemy, he enjoins: with these, grievous

and afflicting as they are, your present circumstances

counsel yon to comply. I do not indeed despair but

that, when the intire -disposal of every thing is given

up to him, he may remit somewhat of the severity of

these'articles. But even these, I think it advisable to
