HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK XXI. 253

of war was deemed suitable to the dignity of the Ro­

man people, even before this time, but more particu­

larly after the destruction of Saguntum, than to enter

into a verbal disquisition concerning the construction

of treaties: for if the business were to be decided by

argument, what simil1tude was there between the treaty

of Hasdrubal and the former treaty of Lutatius, which

was altered ? Since in the latter there was an express

clause inserted, that ' it should be valid, provided the

people should ratify itbut in that of Hasdrubal there

Carthage into Spain, in order to make application to

the several states of that country, and either to en­

joining the Carthaginians. They came, first to the

Bargusian, by whom being favorably received because

that people were dissatisfied with the Carthaginian

government, they roused the spirits of many powers

on the farther side of the Iberus by the flattering pros­

pect of a change in their circumstances. Thence they

came to the Volscians, whose answer, which was re­

ported with applause through every part of Spain, de­
