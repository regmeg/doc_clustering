HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK IX. 105

Qnintus Aulius, came hither with a new army from

Rome; and having, by messengers whom he sent for­

ward, consulted the dictator where he should halt, at

what time, and on what side, he should fall on the

enemy, and being sufficiently apprised of his designs

in every particular, he rested in a place where he was

safe from observation. The dictator, after having kept

spoil of all the nations round who have revolted.' The

soldiers advanced against the enemy with spirits in­

flamed by the dictator's discourse, which seemed to
