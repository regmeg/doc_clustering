having been made consul under propitious auspices,

though gods and men united in recalling him when

ready to give battle, he had refused obedience; and

now, conscious of having treated them with disrespect,

had fled to avoid the capitol, and the customary offer­

stroke, made its escape out of the hands of those

who officiated at the sacrifice, and sprinkled many of

the by-standers with its blood. The confusion and

disorder was great, but still greater among those at

a distance, who knew not the cause of the disturb­
