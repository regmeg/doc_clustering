divine or human, to prevent your entering on the war

anew, without violating the maxims of religion and

justice. I am also of opinion that the consuls, in the

mean time, enlist, arm, and lead out an army; but that

they should not enter the enemy's territories before

people; nor, finally, could they, being sacred and in­

violence.'
