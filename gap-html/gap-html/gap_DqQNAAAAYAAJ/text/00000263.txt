HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK XXI. 249

guntum was taken in the eighth month from the begin­

ning of the siege ; that Hannibal then retired into win­

ter-quarters to New Carthage; and that, in the fifth

month, after leaving Carthage, he arrived again in Italy.

But if these accounts were true, it is impossible that

Publius Cornelius and Tiberius Sempronius could have

been the consuls, to whom, in the beginning of the siege,

the ambassadors were sent from Saguntum; and who,

during their office, fought with Hannibal; the one at

the river Tieinus, and both, a considerable time after,

at the Trebia. Either all these matters must have been

already at their gates ; so that their minds being agi­

scenes of confusion and disorder, rather than of deli­

beration: for ' never,' they observed, ' had an enemy

more enterprising and warlike entered the field with

them ; and at no other period had the Roman power

been so unfit for great exertions, or so deficient in

practice. As to the Sardinians, Corsicans, Istriatis,

and Illyrians, they had only roused the Roman arms

without affording them exercise; and with the Gauls''
