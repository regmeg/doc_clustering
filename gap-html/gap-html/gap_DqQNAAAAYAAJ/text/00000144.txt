brought into inextricable difficulties ; hemmed in, not

more effectually by the arms of their enemy, than by

the disadvantage of the ground.' Their joy was even

mingled with a degree of envy, because Fortune, as

they thought, had transferred the glory of finishing the

Roman war from the Samnites to the Etrurians: they

hastened therefore, with their whole collected force,

to crush the consul Caius Marcius; resolving, if he did

not give them an opportunity of fighting, to proceed

through the territories of the Marsians and Sabines

into Etruria. The consul met them, and a battle was

fought with great fury on both sides, but without a de­

of his country, all remembrance of private animosities.

When the deputies came to Fabius, and delivered to

him the decree of the senate, adding such arguments

as were suitable to their instructions, the consul, cast­

ing his eyes towards the ground, retired in silence,

leaving them in uncertainty what part he intended to

act. Then, in the silent time of the night, according

to the established custom, be nominated Lucius Papi­
