Camertian, and giving the command of the camp to

Lucius Scipio, as propretor, he returned to Rome, in

order to adjust measures for carrying on the war;

either led thereto by his own judgment, on finding it

attended with greater difficulty than he had believed

from report, or being summoned by a decree of senate,

for both accounts are given. Some choose to have it

believed that he was forced to return by the practices

of the pretor, Appius Claudius; who, both in the se­

wont in all his letters, the danger of the Etrurian war ;

contending that ' one general, or one army, would not

be sufficient to oppose four nations: that whether these

directed the whole of their combined force against him

alone, or acted separately in different parts, there was

reason to fear that he would be unable to provide effec­

but two Roman legions; and that the foot and horse

who came with Fabius did not amount to five thousand.

It was therefore his opinion that the consul Publius

Decius should, without delay, join his colleague in

Etruria; and that the province of Samnium should be

given to Lucius Volumnius. But, if the consul pre­

ferred going to his own province, that then Volumnius

should march a full consular army into Etruria to join

the other commander.' The advice of the pretor was

approved by a great part of the members ; but Publius

Decius recommended that every thing should be kept

undetermined and open for Quintus Fabius until he

should either come to Rome, if he could do so without

prejudice to the public, or send some of his lieutenants,

from whom the senate might learn the real state of the

war in Etruria; and what number of troops, and how

many generals, would be requisite for carrying it on.

26. Fabius, on his return to Rome qualified his

discourses, both in the senate and before the people,

in such a manner as to appear neither to exaggerate or

lessen any particular relating to the war; and to show

that, in agreeing to another general being joined with

him, he rather indulged the apprehensions of others
