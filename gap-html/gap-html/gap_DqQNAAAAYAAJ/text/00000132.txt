secretly at all the passes ; and, as soon as they saw that

the Romans had got into the defile, they rose up sud­

denly, with great clamor and tumult, and attacked them

unawares. At first, an event so unexpected caused

some confusion, while they were taking their arms,

and throwing the baggage into the centre; but, as fast

as each had freed himself from his burden, and fitted

himself with arms, they assembled about the standards

from every side ; and all, from the long course of their

service, knowing their particular ranks, they formed

the line without any directions. The consul, riding up

to the place where the fight was most warm, leaped

from his horse, and called ' Jupiter, Mars, and the

other gods to witness, that he had come into that place,

not in pursuit of any glory to himself, but of booty for

his soldiers ; nor could any other fault be charged on

him than too great a solicitude to enrich them at the

expense of the enemy. From the impending disgrace

nothing could extricate him but the valor of the troops:

let them only join unanimously in a vigorous attack

against a foe whom they had already vanquished in

the field, beaten out of their camps, and stripped of

their towns, and who were now trying their last re­

source, in arr attempt to overreach them, by the con­

trivance of an ambuscade, placing their reliance on the

ground they occupied, not on their arms. But what

ground, what station, was now unsurmountable to Ro­

man valor V The citadel of Fregellae, and that of Sora,

were called to their remembrance, with many other

places where difficulties from situation had been sur­

mounted. Animated by these exhortations, the sol­

diers, regardless-of all obstacles, advanced against the

enemy posted above them ; and here they underwent

a good deal of fatigue in climbing the steep. But as

soon as the first battalions got footing in the plain, on

the summit, and the troops'perceived that they now

stood on equal ground, the dismay was instantly turned

on the plotters ; who, dispersing and casting away their

arms, attempted by flight to recover the same lurking

places in which they had lately concealed themselves.
