HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK VIII. 11

throw from the next post, where some horsemen of

Tusculum were stationed, under the command of Ge-

minius Metrius, a man highly distinguished amongst

his countrymen, both by his birth and conduct. On

observiug the Roman horsemen, and the consul's son,

remarkable above the rest, marching at their head,

(for they were all known to each other, particularly

ias' spear passed over the helmet of his antagonist,

and that of Metrius across the neck of the other's

horse: they then wheeled their horses round, and
