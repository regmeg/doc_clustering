HISTORY OF ROME.—BOOK XXI. 261

and carried off six standards. As soon as the troops

had got clear of that difficult and troublesome pass

the Gauls ceased from their attempts, and the Romans

from their fears, and the latter afterwards, easily se­

curing the safety of their march through the open

country, proceeded to Tanetum, a small town on the
