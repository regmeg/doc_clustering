This excited such a degree of commiseration in the

breasts of those very men who, a little before, were

pouring execrations on them, that everyone, forgetting

his ovvu condition, turned away his eyes from that dis­

graceful insult on so high a dignity, as from a spectacle

too horrid to behold.

6. First, the consuls, nearly half naked, were sent

under the yoke ; then each officer, according to his

rank, was exposed to disgrace, and the same of the le­

sions in abundance ; and, on their approach, the whole

senate and people went out to meet them, and per­

formed every proper office of hospitality, both public

and private. But the looks and address of the allies,

joined with all their kindness, could not draw a word

from them, nor even prevail on them to raise their
