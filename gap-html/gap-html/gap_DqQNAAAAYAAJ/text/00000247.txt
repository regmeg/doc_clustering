of the son, the command was held by Hasdrubal;

whom, it was said, Hamilcar had first chosen as a fa-

rorite, on account of his youthful beauty, and after­

youth, when scarcely arrived at the age of manhood,

Hasdrubal had invited by letter to come to him ; and

that affair bad even been taken into deliberation in the

senate, where the Barcine faction showed a desire that

Hannibal should be accustomed to military service,
