battering-rams, demolished a considerable extent of

the wall; and when Hannibal arrived he showed him

the whole ground covered with fresh ruins. The troops

were therefore led instantly against the citadel; and

after a furious engagement, in which great loss was

suffered on both sides, part of the citadel was taken.

Small as were the hopes of in accommodation, attempts

retire, gave audience to Alorcus, who addressed them

in this manner:
