102 . THE DECLINE AND FALL

to annoy the feet of the horses; and as new gates could not suddenly be
procured,

the entrance was guarded by a Spartan rampart of his bravest soldiers. At

the expiration of twenty-five days, Totila returned by hasty marches from Apu­

lia, to avenge the injury and disgrace. Belisarius expected his approach. The

Goths were thrice repulsed in three general assaults; they lost the flower of
their

troops; the royal standard had almost fallen into the hands of the enemy, and

the Fame of Totila sunk, as it had risen, with the fortune of his arms.
\Vhatever

skill and courage could achieve, had been performed by the Roman general; it

remained only, that Justinian should terminate, by a strong and seasonable
effort,

the war which he had ambitiously undertaken. The indolence, perhaps the im­

potence, of a prince who despised his enemies and envied his servants,
protracted

the calamities of Italy. After a long silence, Belisarius was commanded to
leave

a sufficient garrison at Rome, and to transport himself into the province of
Luca-

nia, whose inhabitants, inflamed by catholic zeal, had cast away the yoke of
their

' Arian conquerors. In this ignoble warfare, the hero, invincible against the
power

of the barbarians, was basely vanquished by the delay, the disobedience, and
the

cowardice of his own officers. He reposed in his winter-quarters of Crotona,
in

the full assurance, that the two passes of the Lucanian hills were guarded by
his

cavalry. They were betrayed by treachery or weakness; and the rapid march

of the Goths scarcely allowed time for the escape of Belisarius to the coast
of Si­

cily. At length a fleet and army were assembled for the relief of Ruscianum,
or

Rossano,(l) a fortress sixty furlongs from the ruins of Sybaris, where the
nobles

of Lucania had taken refuge. In the first attempt, the Roman forces were
dissi-

Eated by a storm. In the second they approached the shore; but they saw the

ills covered with archers, the landing-place defended by a line of spears, and
the

king of the Goths impatient for battle. The conqueror of Italy retired with a

sigh, and continued to languish, inglorious and inactive, till Antonina, who
had

been sent to Constantinople to solicit succours, obtained, after the death of
the em­

press, the permission of his return.

The five last campaigns of Belisarius might abate the envy of his competitors,

whose eyes had been dazzled and wounded by the blaze of his former glory. In­

stead of delivering Italy from the Goths, he had wandered like a fugitive
along

the coast, without daring to march into the country, or to accept the bold and
re­

peated challenge of Totila. Yet in the judgment of the few who could
discriminate

counsels from events, and compare the instruments with the execution, he ap­

peared a more consummate master of the art of war, than in the season of his

prosperity, when he presented two captive kings before the throne of
Justinian.

The valour of Belisarius was not chilled by age; his prudence was matured by

experience, but the moral virtues of humanity and justice seem to have yielded

-to the hard necessity of the times. The parsimony or poverty of the emperor  
compelled him to deviate from the rule of conduct which had deserved the love

and confidence of the Italians. The war was maintained by the oppression of
Ra­

venna, Sicily, and all the faithful subjects of the empire; and the rigorous
prosecution

of Herodian provoked that injured or guilty officer to deliver Spoleto into
the hands

of the enemy. The avarice of Antonina, which had been sometimes diverted by

love, now reigned without a rival in her breast. Belisarius himself had always

understood, that riches, in a corrupt age, are the support and ornament of
per­

sonal merit. And it cannot be presumed that he should stain his honour for the

public service, without applying a part of the spoil to his private emolument.

The hero had escaped the sword of the barbarians, but the dagger of conspiracy
(2)

awaited his return. In the midst of wealth aid honours, Ai iiaban, who had
chas­

tised the African tyrant, complained of the ingratitude of courts. He aspired
to

-Prsejecta, the emperor's niece, who wished to reward her deliverer; but the im­  
pediment of his previous marriage was asserted by the piety of Theodora. The

pride of royal descent was irritated by flattery; and the service in which he
gloried,

had proved him capable of bold and sanguinary deeds. The death of Justinian

•was resolved, but the conspirators delayed the execution till they could
surprise

the liberty of the Anecdotes gives him nothing to add.
