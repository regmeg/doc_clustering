OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 425.

capital of the Abbassides. The consternation of the fugitives had already dif­

fused the terror of his name; but the fancied riches of Bagdad had already
been

dissipated by the avarice and prodigality of domestic tyrants. The prayers of
the

people, and the stern demands of the lieutenant of the Bowides, required the
ca­

liph to provide for the defence of the city. The helpless Mothi replied, that
his

arms, his revenues, and his provinces, had been torn from his hands, and that
he

was ready to abdicate a dignity which he was unable to support. The emir waa

inexorable; the furniture of the palace was sold; and the paltry price of
forty thou­

sand pieces of gold was instantly consumed in private luxury. But the
apprehen­

sions of Bagdad were relieved by the retreat of the Greeks; thirst and hunger

guarded the desert of Mesopotamia: and the emperor, satiated with glory, and

laden with oriental spoils, returned to Constantinople, and displayed, in his
tri­

umph, the silk, the aromatics, and three hundred myriads of gold and silver.

Yet the powers of the east had been bent, not broken, by this transient
hurricane.

After the departure of the Greeks, the fugitive princes returned to their
capitals;

the subjects disclaimed their involuntary oaths of allegiance; the Moslems
again

purified their temples, and overturned the idols of the saints and martyrs;
the Nes-

torians and Jacobites preferred a Saracen to an orthodox master; and the num­

bers and spirit of the Melchites were inadequate to the support of the church
and

state. Of these extensive conquests, Antioch, with the cities of Cilicia and
the

isle of Cyprus, was alone restored, a permanent and useful accession to the
Ro­

man empire.(l)
