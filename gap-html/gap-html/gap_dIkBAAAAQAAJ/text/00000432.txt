418 THE COMMONWEALTH AND ITS ECONOMY. [Book IV.

mum in weight and price was fixed; the quantity of silver

plate was likewise restricted by law, and lastly general maxi­

mum rates were prescribed for the expenses of ordinary and

161. festal meals; these, for example, were fixed in 593 at 10 and

81. 100 sesterces (Is. Id. and 15s. lOd.) in 673 at 30 and 300

sesterces (4s. 7$d. and £2 7s.) respectively. Unfortunately

truth requires us to add, that of all the Roman nobles not

more than three—-and these not including the legislators

• themselves—are said to have complied with these imposing

laws; and in the case of these three it was the law of the

Stoa, and not that of the state, that curtailed the bill of fare.

Silver plate. It is worth while to dwell for a moment on the luxury that

went on increasing in defiance of these laws as respects

silver plate. In the sixth century silver plate for the table

was, with the exception of the traditionary silver salt-dish, a

rarity; the Carthaginian ambassadors jested over the cir­

cumstance, that at every house to which they were invited

they had encountered the same silver plate (ii. 21). Scipio

JEmilianus possessed not more than 32 pounds (£130) in

121. wrought silver; his nephew Quintus Fabius (consul in 633)

first brought his plate up to 1000 pounds (£4025), Marcus

91- Drusus (tribune of the people in 663) reached 10,000 pounds

(£40,250); in Sulla's time there were already counted in the

capital about 150 silver state-dishes weighing 100 pounds

each, several of which brought their possessors into the

lists of proscription. To judge of the sums expended on

these, we must recollect that the workmanship was paid for

at enormous rates; for instance, Gaius Gracchus paid for

choice articles of silver fifteen times, and Lucius Crassus,

9.5. consul in 659, eighteen times the value of the metal, and the

latter gave for a pair of cups by a noted silversmith 100,000

sesterces (£1050). So it was in proportion everywhere.

Marriage. How it fared with marriage and the rearing of children,

is shown by the Gracchan agrarian laws, which first placed

a premium thereon (P. 90). Divorce, formerly in Rome

almost unheard of, was now a daily occurrence; while in the

oldest Roman marriage the husband had purchased his

wife, it might have been proposed to the noble Romans of

the present times that, with the view of bringing the name

into accordance with the reality, they should introduce

marriage for hire.. Even a man like Metellus Maeedonicus,

who for his honourable domestic life and his numerous host

of children was the admiration of his contemporaries, when
