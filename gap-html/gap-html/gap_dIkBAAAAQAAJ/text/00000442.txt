428 NATIONALITY, RELIGION, AND EDUCATION. [Book IV.

except that, as might be expected, the sophists made war

more against the popular faith, Carneades and his disciples

more against their philosophical colleagues. On the other

hand Epicurus and Zeno agreed both in their aim of ration­

ally explaining the nature of things, and in their physiolo­

gical method, which set out from the idea of matter. They

diverged, in so far as Epicurus, following the atomic theory

of Democritus, conceived the first principle as rigid matter,

and evolved the manifoldness of things out of this matter

merely by mechanical variations; whereas Zeno, forming his

views after the Ephesian Heraclitus, introduces even into

his primordial matter a dynamic antagonism and a move­

ment of fluctuation up and down. From this are derived the

further distinctions—that in the Epicurean system the gods

as it were did not exist or were' at the most a dream of

dreams, while the Stoical gods formed the ever active soul

of the world, and were as spirit, as sun, as God powerful

over the body, the earth, and nature; that Epicurus did not,

while Zeno did, recognize a government of the world and a

personal immortality of the soul; that the proper object of

human aspiration was according to Epicurus an absolute

equilibrium disturbed neither by bodily desire nor by mental

conflict, while it was according to Zeno a manly activity

always increased by the constant antagonistic efforts of the

mind and body, and striving after a harmony with nature

perpetually in conflict and perpetually at peace. But in

one point all these schools were agreed with reference to

religion, that faith as such was nothing, and had necessarily

to be supplemented by reflection—whether this reflection

might consciously despair of attaining any result, as did the

Academy, or might reject the conceptions of the popular

faith, as did the school of Epicurus, or might partly retain

them with explanation of the reasons for doing so, and

partly modify them, as did the Stoics.

It was accordingly only natural, that the first contact

of Hellenic philosophy with the Roman nation equally strong

in faith and adverse to speculation was of a thoroughly hos­

tile character. The Roman religion was entirely right in

disdaining alike the assaults and the theoretic support of

these philosophical systems, both of which did away with its

proper character. The Roman state, which instinctively felt

itself assailed when religion was attacked, reasonably as­

sumed towards the philosophers the attitude which a for­
