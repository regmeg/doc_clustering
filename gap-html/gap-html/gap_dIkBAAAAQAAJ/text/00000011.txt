PREFATORY NOTE.

The changes, which the Author has had occasion to make in

the new edition of the third and fourth volumes of this

work, have chiefly arisen out of the recent discovery of the

Fragments of Licinianus, which have supplemented our

defective information as to the epoch from the battle of

Pydna to the revolt of Lepidus in various not unimportant

points, but have also suggested various fresh difficulties.
