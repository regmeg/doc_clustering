Hi NATIONALITY, RELIGION, AND EDUCATION. [Book IV.

murder of his comrade in arms; they charged Orestes with

the murder of his mother, or undertook to defend him; or

perhaps they helped Hannibal with a supplementary good

advice as to the question whether he would do better to

comply with the invitation to Rome, or to remain in Carthage,

or to take flight. It was natural that the Catonian opposi­

tion should once more bestir itself against these offensive

^2. and pernicious conflicts of words. The censors of 662

issued a warning to teachers and parents not to allow the

young men to spend the whole day in exercises, whereof

their ancestors had known nothing; and the man, from

whom this warning came, was no less than the first forensic

orator of his age, Lucius Licinius Crassus. Of course .the

Cassandra spoke in vain; declamatory exercises in Latin on

the current themes of the Greek schools became a permanent

ingredient in the education of Roman youth, and contributed

their part to educate the very boys as forensic and political

players and to stifle in the bud all earnest and true

eloquence.

As the aggregate result of this modern Roman education

there sprung up the new idea of "humanity," as it was

called, which consisted partly of a more or less superficial

appropriation of the aesthetic culture of the Hellenes, partly

of a privileged Latin culture as an imitation or mutilated

copy of the Greek. This new humanity, as the very name

indicates, renounced the specific peculiarities of Roman life,

nay even came forward in opposition to them, and com­

bined in itself, just like our closely kindred "general

culture," a nationally cosmopolitan and socially exclusive

character. Here too we trace" the revolution, which sepa­

rated classes and levelled nations.
