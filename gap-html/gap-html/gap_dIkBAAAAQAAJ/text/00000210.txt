CHAPTER VI.

THE ATTEMPT OF MARIUS AT REVOLUTION AND THE

ATTEMPT OF DRUSUS AT REFORM.

Marius. Gaics Marius, the son of a poor day-labourer, was born in

155. 599 at the village of Cereatae then belonging to Arpinum,

which, afterwards obtained municipal rights as Cereats

Marianae and still at the present day bears the name of

"Marius' Home" (Casamare). He was reared at the

plough, in circumstances so mean that they seemed to pre­

clude him from access even to the magistracies of Arpinum:

he learned early—what he practised afterwards even when a

general—to bear hunger and thirst, the heat of summer and

the cold of winter, and to sleep on the hard ground. As

soon as his age allowed him, he had entered the army, and

in the severe school of the Spanish wars had rapidly raised

himself to the position of an officer. In Scipio's Numantine

war he, at that time twenty-three years of age, attracted the

notice of the stern general by the neatness with which he

kept his horse and his accoutrements, as well as by his

bravery in combat and his propriety of demeanour in camp.

He had returned home with honourable scars and warlike

distinctions, and with the ardent wish to make himself a

name in the career on which he had gloriously entered; but,

as matters then stood, a man of even the highest merit could

not attain those political offices, which alone led to the

higher military posts, without wealth and without connec­

tions. The young officer acquired both by fortunate com­

mercial speculations and by his union with a maiden of the

ancient patrician gens of the Julii. So by dint of great efforts

115. and after various rejections he succeeded, in 639, in attain­

ing the praetorship, in which he found opportunity of dis­
