152 THE RULE OF THE RESTORATION. [Book IV.

of the tribune of the people Gaius Mamilius Limetanus, in

spite of the timid attempts of the senate to avert the

threatened punishment, an extraordinary jury-commission

was appointed to investigate the high treason that had

occurred in connection with the question of the Numidian

succession; and its sentences sent the two former com­

manders in chief Gaius Bestia and Spurius Albinus as well

as Lucius Opimius, the head of the first African commission

and the executioner withal of Gaius Gracchus, along with

numerous other less notable men of the government party,

guilty and innocent, into exile. That these prosecutions,

however, were only intended to appease the excitement of

seemed according to the new ideas of the sanctity of trea­

ties no longer necessary—and determined, this time in all

earnest, to renew the war. The supreme command in

Africa was intrusted, as was natural, to an aristocrat, but

yet to one of the few men of the nobility who in a military

Metellusap- and moral point of view were equal to the task. The choice

i»intcd to fell on Quintus Metellus. He was, like the whole powerful

the com- family to which he belonged, in principle a rigid and un­

scrupulous aristocrat; as a magistrate, he, no doubt, reckoned

it honourable to hire assassins for the good of the state and

would probably have ridiculed the act of Fabricius towards

Pyrrhus as romantic knight errantry, but he was an inflex­
