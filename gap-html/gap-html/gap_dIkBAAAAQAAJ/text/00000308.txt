294 THE EAST AND KING MITHRADATES. [Book IV.

deliverer; it was usual to compliment the king, in whom

as in the divine conqueror of the Indians Asia and

Hellas once more found a common meeting-point, under the

name of the new Dionysus. The cities and islands sent

messengers to meet him, wherever he went, and to invite

"the delivering god" to visit them; and in festal attire the

citizens flocked forth in front of their gates to receive him.

Several places delivered the Roman officers sojourning

among them in chains to the king; Laodiceathus surrendered

Quintus Oppius, the commandant of the town, and Mytilene

in Lesbos the consular Manius Aquillius.* The whole

fury of the barbarian, who gets the man before whom he has

trembled into his power, discharged itself on the unhappy

author of the war. The aged man was led throughout Asia

1 Minor, sometimes on foot chained to a powerful mounted

Bastarnian, sometimes bound on an ass and proclaiming his

own name; and, when at length the pitiful spectacle again

arrived at the royal quarters in Pergamus, by the king's

orders molten gold was poured down his throat—in order

to satiate his avarice, which had really occasioned the war—

till he expired in torture.

him to put to death on one and the same day all Italians

residing within their bounds, whether free or slaves, with­

out distinction of sex or age, and on no account, under

severe penalties, to aid any of the proscribed to escape; to

cast forth the corpses of the slain as a prey to the birds; to

confiscate their property and to hand over one half of it to

the murderers, and the other half to the king. The horrible

orders were—excepting in a few districts, such as the island

of Cos—punctually executed, and eighty, or according to

other accounts one hundred and fifty, thousand—if not

innocent, at least defenceless—men, women, and children

were slaughtered in cold blood in one day in Asia Minor;

a fearful execution, in which the good opportunity of getting

rid of debts and the Asiatic servile willingness to perform

any executioner's office at the bidding of the sultan had at

twenty-five years afterwards, when after Mithradates' death his son Pharnaces

handed them over to the Romans.
