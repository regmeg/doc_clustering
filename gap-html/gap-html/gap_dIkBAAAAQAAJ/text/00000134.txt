120 THE REVOLUTION AND GAIUS GRACCHUS. [Book IV.

absolute type—in the form of a magistracy continued for

life by regular re-election and rendered absolute by an un­

conditional command of the formally sovereign comitia, an

unlimited tribuneship of the people for life. In fact if

Gracchus, as his words and still more his works plainly

testify, aimed at the overthrow of the government of the

senate, what other political organization but the Tyrannia

remained possible, after overthrowing the aristocratic

government, in a commonwealth which had outgrown

collective assemblies and had no knowledge of parliamen­

tary government? Dreamers such as was his predecessor,

and knaves such as after times produced, might call this in

question; but Gaius Gracchus was a statesman, and though

the formal shape, which that great man had projected for his

great work, has not been handed down to us and may be

conceived of very variously, yet he was beyond doubt aware

of what he was doing. But while the intention of usurp­

ing monarchical power can scarcely be mistaken, those

who survey the whole circumstances will scarcely blame

Gracchus for it. An absolute monarchy is a great misfor­

tune for a nation, but it is a less misfortune than an

absolute oligarchy; and history cannot censure one who

imposes on a nation the lesser suffering instead of the

greater, least of all in the case of a nature so vehemently

earnest and so far aloof from all that is vulgar as was that

of Gaius Gracchus. Nevertheless it may not conceal the

fact that his whole legislation was pervaded in the most

pernicious way by conflicting aims, inasmuch as on the one

hand it aimed at the public good, and on the other hand

ministered to the personal objects and in fact the personal

vengeance of the ruler. Gracchus earnestly laboured to

find a remedy for social evils, and to check the spread of

pauperism ; yet he at the same time intentionally reared up

a street proletariate of the worst kind in the capital by his

distributions of corn, which were designed to be, and

became, a premium to all the lazy and hungry civic rabble.

Gracchus censured in the bitterest terms the venality of the

senate, and in particular laid bare with unsparing and just

severity the scandalous traffic which Manius Aquillius had

driven with the provinces of Asia Minor ;* yet it was through

* A considerable fragment of an oration of Gracchus, still extant, relates to  
this trafficking about the possession of Phrygia, which after the confiscation
of

the kingdom of Attalus was offered for sale by Manius Aquillius to the kings
