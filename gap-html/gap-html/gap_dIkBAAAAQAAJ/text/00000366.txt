352 THE SULLAN CONSTITUTION. [Book IV.

mere caprice of the executioners. It was not at least to the

personal resentment of the regent that the mass of these

victims were sacrificed; his furious hatred was directed

solely against the Marians, the authors of the hideous mas-

87. 82. sacres of 667 and 672. At his command the tomb of the

conqueror of Aquae Sextiae was broken open and his ashes

were scattered in the Anio, the monuments of his victories

over Africans and Germans were overthrown, and, as death

had snatched himself and his son from Sulla's vengeance,

his adopted nephew Marcus Marius Gratidianus, who had

been twice praetor and was a great favourite with the

Roman burgesses, was executed amid the most cruel tor­

tures at the tomb of Catulus the most lamentable of the

Marian victims. In other cases also death had already

swept away the most notable of his opponents; of the

leaders there survived only Gaius Norbanus, who laid hands

on himself at Rhodes, while the assembly was deliberating on

his surrender; Lucius Scipio, whose insignificance and pro­

cording to Floras (ii. 9, whence Augustin, de Civ. Dei, iii. 28), 2000
senators

and knights. According to Plutarch (Sull. 31), 520 names were placed on the

list in the first three days; according to Orosius (v. 21), 580 names duriDg

the first days. There is no material contradiction between these various

reports, for, on the one hand, it was not senators and knights alone that

were put to death, and, on the other hand, the list remained open for months.

When Appian, at another passage (i. 103), mentions as put to death or banished

by Sulla 15 consulars, 90 senators, 2600 knights, he there confounds, as the

context shows, the victims of the civil war throughout with the victims of
Sulla.

Antonius, 655;

When, on the other hand, the Livianaccount in Eutropius (v. 9) and Orosius

(v. 22). specifies as swept away (consumpti) in the Social and Civil wars,

24 consulars, 7 praetorians, 60 aedicilians, 200 senators, the calculation
includes

partly the men who fell in the Italian war, such as the consulars Aulus
Albiuus,

consul in 665; Titus Didius, 656; Publius Lupus, 664; Lucius Cato, 665;

partly perhaps Quiutus Metellus Numidicus (P. 217), Manius Aquillius, Gaius

Marius the father, Gnaeus Strabo whom we may certainly regard as also

victims of that period, or other men whose fate is unknown to us. Of the

fourteen consular* killed three—'Rufus, Cinna, and Flaccus—fell through

military revolts, while eight Sullan and three Marian consulars fell as
victims

to the opposite party. On a comparison of the figures given above, 50 sena­

tors and 1000 equitcs were regarded as victims of Marius, 40 senators and

1600 equites as victims of Sulla; this furnishes a standard—at least not

altogether arbitrary—for estimating the extent of the mischief on both sides.
