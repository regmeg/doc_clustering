388 THE SULLAN CONSTITUTION'. [Book IV.

to executioners, confiscations of goods, summary procedure

with insubordinate officers had occurred a hundred times,

and the obtuse political morality of ancient civilization had

for such things but lukewarm censure; but it was unexam­

pled that the names of the outlaws should be publicly

posted up and their heads publicly exposed, that a set sum

should be fixed for the bandits who slew them and that it

should be duly entered in the public account-books, that

the confiscated property should be brought to the hammer

like the spoil of an enemy in the public market, that the

general should order a refractory officer to be at once cut

down and acknowledge the deed before all the people. This

public mockery of humanity was also a political error; it

contributed not a little to envenom later revolutionary

crises beforehand, and on that account even now a dark

shadow deservedly rests on the memory of the author of

the proscriptions.

Sulla may moreover be justly blamed that, while in all

important matters he acted with remorseless vigour, in

subordinate and more especially in personal questions he

very frequently yielded to his sanguine temperament and

dealt according to his likings or dislikings. Wherever he

really felt hatred, as for instance against the Marians,

he allowed it to take its course without restraint even

against the innocent, and made it his boast that no one had

better requited friends and foes.* He scorned not to take

advantage of his place and power to accumulate a colossal

fortune. The first absolute monarch of the Roman state, he

forthwith verified the maxim of absolutism—that the laws

do not bind the prince—in the case of those laws which he

himself issued as to adultery and extravagance. But his

lenity towards his own party and his own circle was more

pernicious for the state than his indulgence towards

himself. The laxity of his military discipline, although it

was partly enjoined by his political exigencies, may be

reckoned as coining under this category; but far more per­

nicious was his indulgence towards his political adherents.

The extent of his forbearance occasionally is hardly credible;

for instance Lucius Murena was not only released from
