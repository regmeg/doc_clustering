348 THE SULLAN CONSTITUTION. [Book IV.

purely aristocratic blood was in general of no use, and

that Sulla clearly discerned its uselessness, is shown by the

fact that, with the exception of Quintus Metellus who was

related to him by marriage, he selected all his instruments

out of what was previously the middle party and the deserters

from the democratic camp—such as Lucius Flaccus, Lucius

Philippus, Quintus Ofella, Gnaeus Pompeius. Sulla was as

much in earnest about the restoration of the old constitu­

tion as the most vehement aristocratic emigrant; he under­

stood however, not perhaps to the full extent—for how in

that case could he have put hand to the work at all ?—but

better at any rate than his party, the enormous difficulties

which attended this work of restoration. Comprehensive

concessions so far as concession was possible without affect­

ing the essence of oligarchy, and the establishment of an

energetic system of repression and prevention, were both in

his view unavoidable; and he saw clearly that the senate as

it stood would refuse or mutilate every concession, and would

parliamentarily ruin every systematic reconstruction. If

Sulla had already after the Sulpician revolution carried out

what he deemed necessary in both respects without asking

much of their advice, he was now determined, under circum­

stances of far more severe and intense excitement, to restore

the oligarchy—not with the aid, but in spite, of the oligarchs

—by his own hand.

Sulla regent Sulla, however, was not now consul as he had been then,

of Rome- but was furnished merely with proconsular, that is to say,

purely military power; he needed an authority, preserving

with all possible strictness constitutional forms, but yet

extraordinary, in order to impose his reform on friends and

foes. In a letter to the senate he announced to them that

it seemed to him indispensable that they should place the

regulation of the state in the hands of a single man

equipped with unlimited plenitude of power, and that be

deemed himself qualified to fulfil this difficult task. This

proposal, disagreeable as it was to many, was under the

existing circumstances a command. By direction of the

senate its chief, the interrex Lucius Valerius Flaccus the

father, as interim holder of the supreme power submitted to

the burgesses the proposal, that the proconsul Lucius Cor­

nelius Sulla should now receive a retrospective approval

of all his official acts as consul and proconsul, and should

be empowered in future to adjudicate without appeal on
