CHAPTER XI.

THE COMMONWEALTH AND ITS ECONOMY.

External We have traversed a period of ninety years—forty years of

and internal profound peace, fifty of an almost constant revolution. It

b?n'v,rURtCy *s tne mos* inglorious epoch known in Roman history. It

westerly direction (P. 168, 177), and the Roman arms

reached in the Spanish peninsula as far as the Atlantic

Ocean (P. 18) and in the Macedono-Grecian peninsula as lar

as the Danube (P. 177); but the laurels thus gained were as

cheap as they were barren. The circle of the "extraneous

peoples under the will, sway, dominion, or friendship of the

Roman burgesses,"* was not materially extended; men were

content to realize the gains of a better age and to bring the

communities attached to Rome in laxer forms of dependence

more and more into full subjection. Behind the brilliant

screen of provincial reunions was concealed a very sen­

sible decline of Roman power. While the whole ancient

civilization was daily more and more distinctly embraced in

the Roman state and received in it a more general re­

cognition, the nations excluded from it began simultane­

ously beyond the Alps and beyond the Euphrates to pass

from defence to aggression. On the battle-fields of Aqu»

Sextiae and Vereellae, of Chaeronea and Orchomenus, were

heard the first peals of that thunder-storm, which the Ger­

manic tribes and the Asiatic hordes were destined to bring

upon the Italo-Grecian world, and the last dull rolling of

* Exteroe nationes in arbitratu dicione potestate amicitiave populi Bonum  
(lex repet, v. 1), the official designation of the non-Italian subjects and
clients

as contrasted with the Italian "allies and kinsmen" (socii nominisve Latini).
