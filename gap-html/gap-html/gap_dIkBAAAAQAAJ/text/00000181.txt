route from the Pyrenees to the Alps; and its mercantile

some of which were attended with much loss, this district

of the mountains was compelled to furnish thenceforth

standing hostages to the Massiliots and to pay them a yearly

tribute. It is not improbable that about this same period

the cultivation of the vine and olive, which flourished in

this quarter after the model set by the Massiliots, was in

the interest of the Italian landholders and merchants

simultaneously prohibited throughout the territory beyond

the Alps dependent on Massilia.* A similar character of and the

financial speculation marks the war, which was waged by Salassi.

in the whole valley of the Dorea Baltea). The great extent of

these washings, which deprived the inhabitants of the country

lying lower down of water for their fields, first gave rise to

an attempt at mediation and then to the armed intervention

of the Romans. The war, although the Romans began it

like all the other wars of this period with a defeat, led at

last to the subjugation of the Salassi and the cession of the

gold district to the Roman treasury. Some forty years
