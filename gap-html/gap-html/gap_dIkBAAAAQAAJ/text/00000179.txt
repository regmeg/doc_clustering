new element emerged in these preliminary crises; this was

the introduction of military men and of military power into

the political revolution. Whether Marius' appearance would

be the immediate prelude of a new attempt to supersede the

oligarchy by the tyrannis, or whether it would, as in various

similar cases, pass away without further consequence as an

isolated encroachment on the prerogative of the government,

could not yet be determined; but it could well be foreseen

that, if. these rudiments of a second tyrannis should attain

any development, it was not a statesman like Gaius

Gracchus, but an officer that would become its head. The

contemporary reorganization of the military system—which

Marius introduced when, in forming his army destined for

Africa, he disregarded the property-qualification hitherto

required, and allowed even the poorest burgess, if he was

otherwise serviceable, to enter the legion as a volunteer—

may have been projected by its author on purely military

grounds; but it was none the less on that account a moment­

ous political event, that the army was no longer, as formerly,

composed of those who had much, no longer even, as in the

most recent times, composed of those who had something, to

lose, but became gradually converted into a host of people

who had nothing but their arms and what the general be­

stowed on them. The aristocracy ruled in 650 as absolutely 104.

to appear by the side of the crown.
