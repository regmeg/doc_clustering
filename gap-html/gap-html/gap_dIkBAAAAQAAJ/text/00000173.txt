Chap. IV.] THE RULE OF THE RESTORATION, 159

was quite clear: numerous persons unfriendly for reasons

good or bad to the government, and especially the justly

indignant mercantile order, desired nothing better than such

an opportunity of annoying the aristocracy in its most

sensitive point: he was elected to the consulship by an

enormous majority, and not only so, but while, in other cases

by the law of Gaius Gracchus the duty of determining the

functions to be assigned to the consuls lay with the senate

(P. 118), he was exceptionally invested by decree of the

people with the supreme command in the African war.

Accordingly he succeeded Metellus in 648; but his con 106.

Rome was more easily given than fulfilled. Marius carried

on a desultory warfare with the Gaetulians; he reduced

several towns that had not previously been occupied; he

undertook an expedition to Capsa which surpassed even

that of Thala in difficulty, took the town by capitulation,

and in spite of the convention caused all the adult men in

it to be slain—the only means, no doubt, of preventing the

renewed revolt of that remote city of the desert; he attacked

a mountain-stronghold—situated on the river Molochath,

which separated the Numidian territory from the Maure-

tanian—whither Jugurtha had removed his treasure-chest,

and, just as he was about to desist from the siege in despair

of success, fortunately gained possession of the impregnable

fastness through the coup de main of some daring climbers.

Had his object merely been to harden the army by bold

razzias and to procure booty for the soldiers, or even to

eclipse Metellus' march into the desert by an expedition

going still further, this method of warfare might be allowed

to pass unchallenged; but the main object to be aimed at,

and which Metellus had steadfastly and perseveringly kept

in view—the capture of Jugurtha—was in this way utterly

set aside. The expedition of Marius to Capsa was an ad­

venture as aimless, as that of Metellus to Thala had been

judicious; but the expedition to the Molochath, which

passed along the border of, if not into, the Mauretanian

territory, was directly repugnant to sound policy. King

Bocchus, in whose power it lay to bring the war to an issue

favourable for the Romans or endlessly to prolong it, now

concluded with Jugurtha a treaty, in which the latter ceded

to him a part of his kingdom and Bocchus promised actively
