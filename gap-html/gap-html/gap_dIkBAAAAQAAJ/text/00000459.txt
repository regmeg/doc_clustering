LITERATURE AND ART.

The sixth century was, both in a political and a literary Literary

point of view, a vigorous and great age. It is true that we reaction.

do not find in the field of authorship any more than in that

of politics a man of the first rank; Naevius, Ennius, Plautus,

talent; nevertheless we perceive in the soaring, stirring,

bold strain of their dramatic, epic, and historic attempts.,

that these are based on the gigantic struggles of the Punic

wars. Much is only artificially transplanted, there are

performance betrays the stamp of its scholastic origin and

wants independence and completeness; yet there exists in

the poets and authors of that age, if not the full power to

reach their high aim, at any rate the courage to compete

with and the hope of rivalling the Greeks. It is otherwise

in the epoch before us. The morning mists fell; what had

sultriness of the approaching revolutionary storm began to

fill the air, and on the other hand the eyes of the more

intelligent were gradually opened to the incomparable glory

of Greek poetry and art and to the very moderate artistic
