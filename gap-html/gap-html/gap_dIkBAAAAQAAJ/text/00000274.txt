260 THE REVOLT OF THE ITALIAN SUBJECTS, [Book IV.

man of note belonging to the party of Crassus and Drusus

who had come forth uninjured from the storm of the Varian

prosecutions, he felt himself called on to complete the work of

Drusus and finally to abolish the still subsisting disabilities

of the new burgesses—for which purpose he needed the

tribunate. Several acts of his even during his tribunesbip

are mentioned, which betray the very opposite of demagogic

designs. For instance, he prevented by his veto one of his

colleagues from cancelling through a decree of the people the

sentences of jurymen issued under the Varian law; and when

the late aedile Gaius Caesar unconstitutionally became a can­

didate for the consulship, passing over the praetorship with

the design, it was alleged, of getting the charge of the Asiatic

war afterwards intrusted to him, Sulpicius opposed him

more resolutely and sharply than any one else. Entirely in

the spirit of Drusus, he thus required from himself and from

others primarily and especially the maintenance of the con­

stitution. But in fact he was as little able as was Drusus

to reconcile things that were incompatible, and to carry out

in strict form of law the change of the constitution which

he had in view—a change judicious in itself, but never to be

obtained from the great majority of the old burgesses by

amicable means. His breach with the powerful family of

the Julii—among whom the consular Lucius Caesar, the

brother of Gaius, in particular was very influential in the

senate—and with the section of the aristocracy adhering to

it, beyond doubt materially co-operated and carried the

irascible man through personal exasperation beyond his

original design. Yet the proposals brought in by him were

of such a nature, as to be by no means out of keeping with

the personal character and the previous party-position of

Tendency of their author. The equalization of the new burgesses with

these laws- the old was simply a partial resumption of the proposals

drawn up by Drusus in favour of the Italians and, like

these, only a carrying out of the requirements of a sound

policy. The recall of those condemned by the Varian jury­

men no doubt Sacrificed the principle of the inviolability

of such decisions, which Sulpicius himself had just practi­

cally defended; but it tended mainly to benefit in the first

instance the members of the proposer's own party, the

moderate conservatives, and it may be very well conceived

that so impetuous a man might when first coming forward

decidedly combat such a measure and then, indignant at the
