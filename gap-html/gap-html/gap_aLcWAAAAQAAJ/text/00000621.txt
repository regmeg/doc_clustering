NOTES ON THE FIRST CHAPTER.

[i] pviON CASSIUS, (1. liv. p. 736.) with

\-J the annotations of Reymar, who has

collected all that Roman vanity has left upon the

subject. The marble of Ancyra, on which Augustus

recorded his own exploits, asserts that he compelled

the Parthians to restore the ensigns of Crassus.

[2] Strabo, (1. xvi. p. 780.) Pliny, the elder

(Hist. Natur. 1. vi. c. 32. 3;.) and Dion Caffius

(I. liii. p. 7Z3, and 1. liv. p. 734.) have left usvery

curious details concerning these wars. The Ro­

mans made themselves masters of Mariaba, or Me-

rab, a city of Arabia F.clix, well known to the

Orientals (fee Abulfeda and the Nubian geography

f>. 52). They were advanced within three days

journey of the Spice country, the rich object of their

invasion-.

legions. Sec the first book of the Annals of Tacitus.

Sucton. in August, c. 23, and Velleius Paterculus,

1. ii. c. 117, &c. Augustus did not receive the

melancholy news with all the temper and firmness

that might have been expected from his character.

p. 833, and the speech of Augustus himself, in

Julian's Cæsars. It receives great light from the

learned notes of his French translator, M. Span-

heim.

[5] Germanicus, Suetonius Paulinos, and Agri­

cola, were checked and recalled, in the course of

their victories. Corbulo was put to death. Mi-

litary merit, as it is admirably expressed by Tacitus,

was, in the strictest fense of the word, imperateria

•virtus.

[6] Cæsar himself conceals that ignoble motive;

but it is mentioned by Suetonius, c. 47. The I! ri-

ttlh pearls proved, however, of little value, on ac­

count of their dark and livid colour. Tacitus

observes, with reason, (in Agricola, c. 12.) that it

was an inherent defect. "Ego facilius crediderim,

naturam margarhis deesse quam nobis avaritiam."

[7] Claudius, Nero, and Domitian. A hope is

expressed by Pomponius Mela, 1. iii. c. 6. (He wrote

under Claudius) that by the success of the Roman

arms, the island and its savages would soon be better

known. It is amusing enough to peruse such pas­

sages in the midst of London.

[8] See the admirable abridgment, given by

Tacitus, in the life of Agricola, and copiously,

though perhaps not completely illustrated, by our

own antiquarians, Camdcn and Horfley.

[9] The Irish writers, jealous of their national

honour, are extremely provoked on this occasion,

both with Tacitus and with Agricola.

[10] See Horfley'sBritannia Romana, 1. i. c. 10.

[n] The poet Buchanan celebrates, with ele­

gance and spirit, (see his Sylvæ v.) the unviolated

independence of his native country. But, if the

single testimony of Richard of Cirencester was suf­

ficient to create a Roman province of Vespasiana to

the north of the wall, that independence would be

reduced within very narrow limits.

[12] See Appian (in Proæm.) and the uniform

imagery of Ossian's Poems, which, in every hypo­

thesis, were composed by a native Caledonian.

[13] See Pliny's Panegyric, which seems sounded

on facts.
