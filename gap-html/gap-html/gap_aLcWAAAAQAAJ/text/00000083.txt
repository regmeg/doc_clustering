OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

All these cities wire connected with each other, and with the

capital by- the -public highways, which issuing from the forum of

Rome, traversed Italy, pervaded the provinces, and were termi-

mated only by the frontiers of the empire/ If-we carefully trace

the distance from the wall of Antoninus to Rome, and from thence

to Jerusalem, it will be found that the great chain of communi­

cation, from the north-west to the south-east point of the empire,

was drawn out to the length of four thousand and eighty Roman

miles 8J. The public roads were accurately divided by mile-stones,

and ran in a direct line from one city to another, with very little

respect for the obstacles either of nature or private property.

Mountains were perforated, and bold arches thrown over the broad­

est and most rapid streams 86. The middle part of the road was

raised into a terrace which commanded the adjacent country, con­

sisted of several strata of sand, gravel, and cement, and was paved

with large stones, or in some places, near the capital, with mar­

ble *7. Such was the solid construction of the Roman highways,

whose firmness has not entirely yielded to the effort of fifteen

centuries. They united the subjects of the most distant provinces

by an easy and familiar intercourse; but their primary object had

been to facilitate the marches of the legions; nor was any country

considered as completely subdued, till it had been rendered, in all its

parts, pervious to the arms and authority of the conqueror.

The advantage of receiving the earliest intelligence, and of con­

veying their orders with celerity, induced the emperors to establish

throughout their extensive dominions, the regular institution of

posts 88: Houses were every where erected at the distance only of

five or six miles; each of them was constantly provided with forty

horses, and by the help of these relays, it was easy to travel ad

hundred miles in a day along the .Roman roads 8*. The use of

the; posts uwas allowed .to those who claimed ;it by an Imi

perial mandate; but though originally intended for the public
