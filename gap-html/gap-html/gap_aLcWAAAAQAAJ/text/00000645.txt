NOTES ON THE SIXTH CHAPTER. xxv

[-85] Tacit, in Annal. i. 11. It seems to have

-existed in the time of Appian.

[86] Plutarch, in Pompeio, p. 642.

[87] Strabo, 1. xvii. p. 798.

[88] Velleios Paterculus, 1. ii. c. 39. he seems

to give the preference to the revenue of Gaul.

[89] The Euboic, the Phœnician, and Alex­

andrian talents, were double in weight to the Attic.

See Hooper of ancient weights and measures, p. iv.

C j. It is very probable, that the fame talent was

carried from Tyreto Carthage.

[90] Polyb. 1. xv. c. 2.

[21] Appian in Punicis, p. 84.

[92] Diodorus Sicnlus, 1. v. Cadiz was built by

the Phœnicians a little more than a thousand years

before Christ. See Veil. Patercul. i. 2.

[93] Strabo, 1. iii. p. 148.

[94] Plin. Hist. Natur. 1. xxxiii. c. 3. He men­

tions likewise a silver mine in Dalmatia, that yielded

every day fifty pounds to the state.

[9;] Strabo, 1. x. p. 485. Tacit. Annal. iii. 69.

and iv. 30. See in Tournefort (Voyages au Le­

vant, Lettre viii.) a very lively picture of the actual

misery of Gyarus.

[96] Lipfiut de magnit udine Romana (1. ii. c. 3.)

computes the revenue at one hundred and fifty

millions of gold crowns; but his whole book,

though learned and ingenious, betrays a very heated

imagination.

[97] Tacit. Annal. xiii. 31.

[98] See Pliny (Hist. Natur. 1. vi. c. 23. 1. xii.

c. 18.). His observations, that the Indian commo­

dities were fold at Rome at a hundred times their

original price, may give ns some notion of the pro­

duce of the customs, since that original price a-

mounted to more than eight hundred thousand

pounds.

[99] The ancients were unacquainted with the

art of cutting diamonds.

[ico] M. Bouchaud, in his treatise de l'Impot

chez les Remains, has transcribed this catalogue,

Vol. I.

faom the Digest, and attempts to illustrate it by a

very prolix commentary.

[101] Tacit. Annal. i. 78. Two- years after­

wards, the reduction of the poor kingdom of Cappa-

docia gave Tiberius a pretence for diminishing the

excise to one half; but the relief was of very Ihort

duration.

[102] Dion Caflius, I. Iv. p. 794. 1. Ivi. p.

825.

[103] The sum is only fixed by conjecture.

[104] As the Roman law subsisted for many ages,

the Cognati, or relations on the mother's side, were

not called to the succession. This harsti institution

was gradually undermined by humanity, and finally

abolislied by Justinian.

f jo;] Plin. Panegyric, c. 37.

[106] See Heineccius in the Aotiquit. Juris Ro-

inani, 1. ii.

[107] Horat. 1. ii. Sat. v. Petron. c. 116, &c.

Plin. 1. ii. Epist. 20.

[108] Cicero in Philipp. ii. c. 16.

[109] See his epistles. Every such Will gave him

an occasion of displaying his reverence to the dead,

and his justice to the living. He reconciled both, in

his behaviour to a son who had been disinherited by

his mother (v. 1.).

[110] Tacit. Annal. xiii. 50. Esprit des Loix,

1. xii. c. 19.

[111] See Pliny's Panegyric, the Augustan

history, and Burman. de Vectigal. passim.

[112] The tributes (properly so called) were not

farmed; since the good princes often remitted many

millions of arrears.

[113] The situation of the new citizens is mi­

nutely described by Pliny (Panegyric, c. 37, 38,

39.). Trajan published a law very much in their

favour.

was charged with no more than the third part of
