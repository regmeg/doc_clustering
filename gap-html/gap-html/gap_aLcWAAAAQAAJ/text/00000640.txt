[68] One of his most daring and wanton acts of

power, was the castration of an hundred free Ro­

mans, some of them married men, and even fathers

o'Ffamilies ; merely that his daughter, on her mar­

riage with the young emperor might be attended by

a trairi of eunuchs worthy of an Eastern queen.

{5] About the year 186, M. de Tilhimont is

miserably embarrassed with a passage of Dion, in

which the empress Faustina, who died in the year

1-5, is introduced as having contributed to the rhar-

riage ofSeverus and Julia (I. lxxiv. p. 124.3.). The

learned compiler forgot, that Dion is relating, not a

real fact, but a dream of Severus; and dreams are

circumscribed to no limits of rime or space. Did

M. de Tillemont imagine that marriages were cm-

[9] Baffianus was his first name, as it had been

that of his maternal grandfather. During his

reign he assumed the appellation of Antoninus, which

is employed by lawyers and ancient historians. Af­

ter his death, the public indignation loaded him

with the nick-names of Tarantus and Caracalla.

The first was borrowed from a celebrated Gladiator,,

the second from a long Gallic gown which he dis­

tributed to the people os Rome.

[10] The elevation of Caracalla is fixed by the

accurate M. de Tillemont to the year 198; the asso­

ciation of Geta, to the year 208.

[14] That the Caracul of Cffian, is the Caracalla

of the Roman history, is, perhaps, the only point

of British antiquity, in which Mr. Macpherson and

Mr. Whitaker are of the same opinion; and yet the

opinion is not without difficulty. In theCalcdoaiaa

war, the son of Severus was known only by the ap­

pellation of Antoninus; and it may seem strange,

that the Highland bard should describe him by a

nick-name, invented four years afterwards, scarcely

nsed by the Romans till after the death of that em­

peror, and seldom employed by the most ancient

historians. See Dion, 1. Ixxvii. p. 1317. Hist.
