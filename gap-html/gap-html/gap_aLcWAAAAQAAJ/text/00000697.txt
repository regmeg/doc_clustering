The office of Patriarch was suppressed by Theo-

dosms the younger.

[6] We need only mention the purim, or deliver­

ance of the Jews from the rage of Hainan, which,

till the reign of Theodosius, was celebrated with

insolent triumph and riotous intemperance. Baf-

[7] According to the false Joscphus, Tfepho, the

grandson of Esau, conducted into Italy the army of

Æneas, king of Carthage. Another colony of

Idumæans, flying from the sword of David, took

refuge in the dominions of Romulus, For these,

or for other reasons of equal weight, the name of

Edom was applied by the Jews to the Roman

Empire.

[8] From the arguments of Celsus, as they are,

represented and refuted by Origen (1. v. p.

247—259), we may clearly discover the distinction

that was made between the Jewish people and the

Christian Je3. See in the Dialogue of Minucius

Fœlix (c. 5, 6.) a fair and not inelegant description

of the popular sentiments, with regard to the deser­

tion of the established worship.

[9] Cur nullas aras habent? templa -nulla)

nulla nota simulacra? - - - Unde autem, vel

quis ille, aut ubi, Deus unicus, solitarius, destitutus?

Minucius Fœlix, c. 10. The Pagan Interlocutor

goes on to make a distinction in savour of the Jews,

who had once a temple, altars, victims, &c. • 1

criminal to publish, the knowledge of the true God.

treats the Christians as a company of dreaming en.

Which St. Paul was transported to the third hca'ven.

in another place, Tricphcm, who personates a Chri­

a mysterious oath,

[12] According to Justin Martyr (Apolog. Major,

a. 70—85 ), tlie d.umon, who had gained some

imperfect knowledge of the prophecies, purposely

contrived this resemblance, which might deter,

though by different means, both the people and the

philosophers from embracing the faith of Christ.

[13] In the first and second books of Origen, Celsus

treats the birth and character of our Saviour with the

most impious contempt. The orator Libanius

praises Porphyry and Julian for confuting the folly

of a sect, which styled a dead man of Palestine, God,

and the Son of God. Socrates, Hist. Ecclesiast. iii. 23^

[14] The emperor Trajan refused to incorporate

a company of 150 fire-men, for the use of the city

os NicomcJia. He disliked all association*. See.

Plin. Epist. x. 42, 43.

[15] The proconsul Pliny had published a

general edict against unlawful meetings. The

prudence of the Christians suspended their Agapæ j

but it was impossible for them to omit the exercise

of public worship.

[16J As the prophecies of the antichrist, ap*

proaching conflagration, &c. provoked those Pagans

whom they did not convert, they were mentioned

with caution and reserve; and the Montanists

were censured for disclosing too freely the dangerous

secret. See Mosheim, p. 413.

vicaciam certe et insiexibilem obstinationem debere
