THE DECLINE AND FALL

road to Præneste, was celebrated for baths of singular beauty and extent,

for three stately rooms of an hundred feet in length, and for a magnifi­

cent portico, supported by two hundred columns of the four most

curious and costly sorts of marble '5. The public (hows exhibited at

his expence, and in which the people were entertained with many hun­

dreds of wild beasts and gladiators ,6, seem to surpass the fortune of a

subject, and whilst the liberality of other magistrates was confined to

a few solemn festivals in Rome, the magnificence of Gordian was re­

peated, when he was ædile, every month in the year, and extended,

during his consulship, to the principal cities of Italy. He was twice

elevated to the last mentioned dignity, by Caracalla and by Alexander;

for he possessed the uncommon advantage of deserving the esteem

of virtuous princes, without alarming the jealousy of tyrants. His

long life was innocently spent in the study of letters and the peace-

ful honours of Rome; and, till he was named proconsul of Africa,

by the voice of the senate and the approbation of Alexander'7, he

appears prudently to have declined the command of armies and the

government of provinces. As long as that emperor, lived, Africa

was happy under the administration of his worthy representative;

after the barbarous Maximin had usurped the throne, Gordianus

alleviated the miseries which he was unable to prevent. When he

reluctantly accepted the purple, he was above fourscore years old;

a last and valuable remains of the happy age of the Antonines,

whose virtues he revived in his own conduct, and celebrated in an

elegant poem of thirty books. With the venerable proconsul, his

son, who had accompanied him into Africa as his lieutenant, was

likewise declared emperor. His manners were less pure, but his

character was equally amiable with that of his father. Twenty-two

acknowledged concubines, and a library of sixty-two thousand vo­

lumes, attested the variety of his inclinations; and from the pro­

ductions which he left behind him, it appears that both the one and

the other were designed for use rather than for ostentation ,8. The
