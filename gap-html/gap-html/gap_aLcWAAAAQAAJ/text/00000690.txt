Ixx NOTES ON THE FIFTEENTH CHAPTER.

[68J And yet whatever may be the language

of individual*, it is still the public doctrine of all

the Chriilian churches. The Janfenists, who have

so laboriously studied the works of the fathers,

maintain this sentiment with distinguished zeal, and

the leaned M. de Tillemont never dismisses a vir­

tuous emperor without pronouncing his damnation.

Zuinglius was perhaps the only leader of a party

who ever adopted the milder sentiment, and he

gave no tefs offence to the Lutherans than to the

Catholics. See Bossuet, Histoire des Variations

des Eglises Protestantes, ,L ii. c. 19—22.

[69] Justin and Clemens of Alexandria allow

that some of the philosophers were instructed by

the Logos, confounding its double signification, of

the human reason, and of the Divine Word.

[70] Tertullian, De Spectaculis, c. 30.

[71] Notwithstanding the evasions of Dr. Mid-

dleton, it is impossible to overlook the clear traces

of visions and inspiration, which may be found in

the apostolic fathers.

[72] Dr. Middleton (Free Inquiry, p. 96, kc.)

observes, that as this pretension of all others was

the most difficult to support by art, it was the soonest

given up. 1 he observation suits his hypothesis.

1. iv. These descriptions arc not very unlike the

prophetic fury, for which Cicero (de Divinat. ii.

54.) expresses so little reverence.

[74] Tertullian (Apolog. c. 23.) throws out

a bold defiance to the Pagan magistrates. Of the

primitive miracles, the powerof exorcising, was the

-Only one which has been assumed'by Protestants.

concludes, that the second century was still more

fertile in miracles than the first.

fy] Dr Middleton sent out his introduction in

the year 1747, published his Free Inquiry in 1749,

and before his death, which happened in 17 ;o,

he h.id prepared a vindication of it against his nu>

merous adversaries.

[78] The university of Oxford conferred degrees

on his opponents. From the indignation of Mo.

iheim (p. 221,), we may discover the sentiments of

the Lutheran divines.

[79] It may seem somewhat remarkable, that

Bernard of Clairvaux, who records so many miracles

of his friend St. Malachi, never takes any notice of

his own, which, in their turn, however, are carefully

related by his companions and disciples, In the

long series of ecclesiastical history, does there exist

a single instance of a faint asserting that he him­

self possessed the gist of miracles?

[80] The conversion of Constantice ii the a-rs

which is most usually fixed by Protestants. The

more rational divines are unwilling to admit the

miracles of the iveh, whilst the more credulous are

unwilling to reject those of the vth century.

[81] The imputations of CeMui and Julian,

with the defence of the fathers, are very fairly stated

by Spanheim, Commentaire fur les Cesar* de Julian,

p. 468.

"jam non Christianus."

and death Lucian has left us so entertaining an

account) imposed, for a long time, on the credulous

simplicity of the Christians of Asia.
