independence. Their restless spirit provoked Severus to fend a new

army into Caledonia, with the most bloody orders, not to subdue

but to extirpate the natives. They were saved by the death of their

haughty enemy '*.

This Caledonian war, neither marked by decisive events, nor at- Fingal and

tended with any important consequences, would ill deserve our at足

tention; but it is supposed, not without a considerable degree of

probability, that the invasion of Severus is connected with the most

shining period of the British history or fable. Fingal, whose fame,

the unrelenting revenge of Severus with the generous clemency of

Fingal; the timid and brutal cruelty of Caracalla, with the bravery,

the tenderness, the elegant genius of Oslian; the mercenary chiefs

who, from motives of fear or interest, served under the Imperial stand足

nerate Romans, polluted with the mean vices of wealth and slavery.

The declining health and last illness of Severus inflamed the wild Ambition of

ambition and black passions of Caracalla's foul. Impatient of any CaracaUa*

delay or division of empire, he attempted, more than once, to
