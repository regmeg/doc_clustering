WHENEVER Tacitus indulgea himself b these beautiful

episodes, in which he relates some domestic transaction of

the Germans or of the Parthians, his principal object is to relieve the

attention of the reader from a uniform scene of rice and misery.

From the reign of Augustus to the time of Alexander Severus, the

enemies of Rome were in her bosom; the tyrants, and the soldiers;

and her prosperity had a very distant and feeble interest in tbe revo­

lutions that might happen beyond the Rhine and the Euphrates.

But when the military order had levelled, in wild anarchy, the power

of the prince, the laws of the senate, and even the discipline of the

camp, the barbarians of the north and of the east, who had long

hovered on the frontier, boldly attacked the provinces of a declin­

ing monarchy. Their vexatious inroads became formidable inva­

sions, and, after a long vicissitude of mutual calamities, many tribes

of the victorious invaders established themselves in the provinces of

the Roman empire. To obtain a clearer knowledge of these great

events, we {hall endeavour to form a previous idea of the character,

forces, and designs of those nations who avenged the cause of

Hannibal and Mithridates.

In the more early ages of the world, whilst the forests that covered

Europe afforded a retreat to a few wandering savages, the inha­

bitants of Asia were already collected into populous cities, and re­

duced under extensive empires, the seat of the arts, of luxury, and

df aWpOtlfrn. The Assyrians reigned over the Easttill the scepter

of Ninus and Semiramis dropt from the hands of their enervated

successors.
