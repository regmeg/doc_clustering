NOTES ON THE ELEVENTH CHAPTER.

[j] On the death-of Gallienus, see TrebcHius

^3. 37. Zonaras, I. xii. p. 634. Eutropius, ix. 1 f.

Aareiius Victor in Bpicom. Victor in Cæsar. I

have compared and blended them all, but have

chiefly followed Aurelius Victor, who seems to have

had the best memoirs.

[3] Some supposed him -oddly enough to be rt

bastard of the younger Gordian. Others took ad-

vant?ge of the province of Dardania, to deduce his

origin from Dardanas, and the ancient kings of

Troy.

[4] Noterta, a periodical and official dispatch

■which the Emperors received from the frvmentarii

or agents dispersed through the provincts. Of these

we may speak hereafter.

^5] Hist. August, p. 208. Gallienus describes the

plate, vestments, &c. like a man, who loved and

■understood those splendid trifles.

[6] Julian (Orat. i. p. 6 ) affirms that Claudius

acquired the empire in a just and even holy manner.

But we may distrust the partiality of a kinsman.

[7] Hist. August, p. 203. There are some trifling

differences concerning the circumstances of the last

defeat and death of Aureolus.

[8] Aurelius Victor in Gallien. The people

loudly prayed for the damnation of Gallienus. 1 he

senate decreed that his relations and servants should

be thrown down headlong from the Gemonian

stairs. An obnoxious officer of the revenue had hit

eyes torn out whilst under examination.

[9] Zonaras, I. xii. p. 137.

[10] Zonaras on this occasion mentions Posthu-

mus; but the registers of the senate (Hist. August,

p. 203.) prove that Tetricus was already emperor

of the western provinces.

[11] The Augustan History mentions the smaller,

Zonaras the larger, number; the lively fancy of

Montesquieu induced him to prefer the latter.

[14] According to Zonarai (L xii. p. 638.),

Claudius, before his death, invested him with tbe

purple; but this singular fact is rather contradicted

than confirmed by otiier writers.

[15] See the life of Claudius by Pollio, and the

orations of Mamcrtinus, Eumenius, and Julian,

See likewise the Cæsars ofjulian, p. 313. In Julian,

it was not adulation, but superstition and ranity.

[16] Zosimus, 1. i. p. 42. Pollio (Hist. August,

p. 207.) allows him virtues, and fays, that like Per-

tinax he was killed by the licentious soldiers.

According to Dexappus he died of a disease.

[17] Theoclius (as quoted in the Augustan

History, p. 211.) affirms, that in one day he killed,

with his own hand, forty-eight Sarmatians, and in

several subsequent engagements nine hundred and

fifty. This heroic valour was admired by the sol­

diers, and celebrated in their rude songs, the bur­

den of which was milk, mille, milk occidit.

[18] Acholius (ap. Hist. August, p. 213.) de­

scribes the ceremony of the adoption, as it was per­

formed at Byzantium, in the presence of the em­

peror and his great Officers.

[19] Hist. August, p. 211. This laconic epistle

is truly the work of a soldier; it abounds with

military phrases and words, some of which can­

not be understood without difficulty. Ferra-

mintasamiata is well explained by Salmasiot, The

former of the words means all weapons of offence,

and is contrasted with Anna, defensive armour.

The latter signifies keen and well sharpened.'

[20] Zofim. I. i. p. 45.

[21] Dexippus (ap. Excerpta Legat. p. 12.) re­

lates the whole transaction under the name of Van­

dals. Aurelian married one of the Gothic ladies

to his general Bonosus, who was able to drink with

the Goths and discover their secrets. Hist. August,
