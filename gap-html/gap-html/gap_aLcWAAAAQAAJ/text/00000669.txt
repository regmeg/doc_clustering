NOTES ON THE TWELFTH CHAPTER. xlix

Maniac!, constructed in the neighbourhood of

Francfort against the Catti.

[45] He distributed about fifty or sixty Barbarians to

a Numerus, as it was then called, a corps with whose

established number we are not exactly acquainted.

[46] Camden's Britannia, Introduction, p. 136;

but he speaks from a very doubtful conjecture.

£47] Zosimus, I. i. p. 62. According to Vo-

piscus, another body of Vandals was less faithful.

[48] Hist. August, p. 240. They were probably

expelled by the Goths. Zosim. 1. i. p. 66.

[49] Hist. August, p. 240.

[50] Panegyr. Vet. v. 18. Zosimus, 1. i. p. 66.

[51] Vopifcus in Hist. August, p. 245, 246.

The unfortunate orator had studied rhetoric at Car­

thage, and was therefore more probably a Moor

(Zosim. 1. i. p. 60.) than a Gaul, as Vopifcus call*

him.

[52] Zonaras, 1. xii. p. 638.

[53] A very surprising instance is recorded of the

prowess of Proculus. He had taken one hundred

Sarmatian virgins. The Best of the story he must

relate in his own language; Ex his una nocte de­

cent inivi: omnes tamen, quod in me erat, muli-

eres incra dies quindecim reddidi. Vopifcus in Hist.

August, p. 246.

[54] Proculus, who was a native of Albengue on

the Genoese coast, armed two thousand of his own

slaves. His riches were great, but they were ac­

quired by robbery. It was afterwards a saying of

his family, Nec latrones esse, nec principes fibi

placere. Vopifcus in Hist. August p. 247.

[55] Hist. August, p. 240.

[56] Zosim. 1. i. p. 66.

[57] Hist. August, p. 2316.

[58] Aurel. Victor in Prob. But the policy of

Hannibal, unnoticed by any more ancient writes,

is irreconcilable with the history of his life. He

left Africa when he was nine years old; returned

to it when he was forty-five, and immediately lost

Vot. I.

his army in the decisive battle of Zama. Livius,

xxx. 37.

[59] Hist. August, p. 240. Eutrop. ix. 17.

Aurel. Victor in Prob. Victor Junior. He revoked

the prohibition of Domitian, and granted a general

permission of planting vines to the Gauls, the

Britons, and the Pannonians.

[60] Julian bestows a severe, and indeed exces­

sive censure on the rigour of Probus, who, as he

thinks, almost deserved his fate.

[61] Vopifcus in Hist. August, p. 241. He la­

vishes on this idle hope a large stock of very foolilh

eloquence.

[62] Turris ferrata. It seems to have been a

move able tower, and cased with iron.

[63] Probus, et vereprobus situs est: Victor omni­

um gentium Barbararum; victor etiam tyrannorum.

[64] Yet all this may be conciliated. He was bora

at Narbonne, in Illyricum, confounded by Eutro-

pius with the more famous city of that name in

Gaul. His father might be an African, and hit

mother a noble Roman. Cams himself was edu­

cated in the Capital. See Scaliger Animadversion,

ad Eufeb. Chron. p. 241.

[65] Probus had requested of the senate an eques­

trian statue, and a marble palace, at the public ex-

pence, as a just recompense of the singular merit os

Carus. Vopifcus in Hist. August, p. 249.

[66] Vopifcus in Hist. August, p. 242. 249.

Julian excludes the emperor Carus and both his

sens from the banquet of the Cæsars.

[67] John Malela, torn. i. p. 401. But the au­

thority of that ignorant Greek is very slight.

He ridiculously derives from Carus, the city of

Carrhæ, and the province of Caria, the latter of

which is mentioned by Homer.

[68] Hist. Aug. p. 249. Carus congratulated

the senate, that one of their own order was made

emperor.

[70] See the first eclogue of Calphurnius. The

design of it is preferred by Fontenelle, to that of

Virgil's Pollio. See torn. iii. p. 148.
