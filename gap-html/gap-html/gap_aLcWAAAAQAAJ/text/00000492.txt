THE DECLINE AND FALL

barians of Palestine had exercised as much compassion towards their

idolatrous enemies as they had ever shewn to their friends or

countrymen l6. Passing from the sectaries of the law to the law

itself, they asserted that it was impossible that a religion which

consisted only of bloody sacrifices and trifling ceremonies, and

whose rewards as well as punishments were all of a carnal and

temporal nature, could inspire the love of virtue, or restrain the

impetuosity of passion. The Mosaic account of the creation and

fall of man was treated with profane derision by the Gnostics, who

would not listen with patience to the repose of the deity after

six days labour, to the rib of Adam, the garden of Eden, the

trees of life and of knowledge, the speaking serpent, the forbidden

fruit, and the eternal condemnation pronounced against human

kind for the venial offence of their first progenitorsa7. The

God of Israel was impiously represented by the Gnostics, as a being

liable to passion and to error, capricious in his favour, implacable in

his resentment, meanly jealous of his superstitious worship, and con­

fining his partial providence to a single people, and to this transitory

Use. In- such a character they could discover none of the features of

the wife and omnipotent father of the universe l*. They allowed

that the religion of the Jews was somewhat less criminal than the

idolatry of the Gentiles; but it was their fundamental doctrine, that

the Christ whom they adored as the first and brightest emanation of

the deity, appeared upon earth to rescue mankind from their va­

rious errors, and to reveal a neiv system of truth and perfection.

The most learned of the fathers, by a very singular condescension1,

have imprudently admitted the sophistry of the Gnostics. Ac­

knowledging that the literal fense is repugnant to every principle

of faith as well as reason, they deem themselves secure and in-

vulnerable behind the ample veil of allegory, which they carefully

spread over every tender part of the Mosaic dispensatioa
