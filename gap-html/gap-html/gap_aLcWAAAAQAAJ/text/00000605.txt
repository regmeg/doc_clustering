OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 573

him in chains to the proconsul. The proconsul transmitted him to

the Prætorian præfect of Italy; and Fælix, who disdained even to

give an evasive answer, was at length beheaded at Venufia, in

Lucania, a place on which the birth of Horace has conferred

fame This precedent, and perhaps some imperial rescript, which

was issued in consequence of it, appeared to authorize the gover­

nors of provinces, in punishing with death the refusal of the Chri­

stians to deliver up their sacred books. There were undoubtedly

many persons who embraced this opportunity of obtaining the crown

of martyrdom; but there were likewise too many who purchased

an ignominious life, by discovering and betraying the holy scripture

into the hands of infidels. A great number even of bishops and

presbyters acquired, by this criminal compliance, the opprobrious

epithet of Traditors; and their offence was productive of much

present scandal, and of much future discord, in the African

Church ,5\

The copies, as well as versions of scripture, were already so Demolition of

longer be attended with any fatal consequences; and even the

sacrifice of those volumes, which, in every congregation, were pre­

served for public use, required the consent of some treacherous and

unworthy Christians. But the ruin of the churches was easily

effected by the authority of the government, and by the labour

of the Pagans. In some provinces, however, the magistrates* con­

tented themselves with shutting up the places of religious worship

In others, they more literally complied with the terms of the

edict; and after taking away the doors, the benches, and the pulpit,

which they burnt, as it were in a funeral pile, they completely

demolislied the remainder of the edifice ,59. It is perhaps to this

melancholy occasion, that we should apply a very remarkable story,

which is related with so many circumstances of variety and impro­

bability, that it serves rather to excite than to satisfy our curiosity.
