4i6 THE DECLINE AND FALL

seized the treasure, and scattering it with his accustomed profusion

among the soldiers, endeavoured to awake in their minds the

memory of his ancient dignity and exploits. Before he could

establish his authority, or finish the negociation which he appears

to have entered into with his son Maxentius, the celerity of Con-

stantine defeated all his hopes. On the first news of his perfidy and

ingratitude, that prince returned by rapid marches from the Rhine to

the Saone, embarked on the last mentioned river at Chalons,

and at Lyons, trusting himself to the rapidity of the Rhone, arrived

at the gates of Aries, with a military force which it was im­

possible for Maximian to resist, and which scarcely permitted him to

take refuge in the neighbouring city of Marseilles. The narrow neck

of land which joined that place to the continent was fortified against

the besiegers, whilst the sea was open, either for the escape of

Maximian, or for the succours of Maxentius, if the latter should

chuse to disguise his invasion of Gaul, under the honourable

pretence of defending a distressed, or as he might allege, an

injured father. Apprehensive of the fatal consequences of delay,

Constantine gave orders for an immediate assault; but the scaling

ladders were found too short for the height of the walls, and

Marseilles might have sustained as long a siege as it formerly did

against the arms of Cæsar, if the garrison, conscious either of their

fault or of their danger, had not purchased their pardon by de-

His death. livering up the city and the person of Maximian. A secret but

February.0' irrevocable sentence of death was pronounced against the usurper,

he obtained only the same favour which he had indulged to Se-

verus, and it was published to the world, that, oppressed by the

remorse of his repeated crimes, he strangled himself with his

own hands. After he had lost the assistance, and disdained the

moderate counsels, of Diocletian, the second period of his active life

was a series of public calamities and personal mortifications, which

were terminated, in about three years, by an ignominious death.
