THE DECLINE AND FALL, &c.

the feeble efforts of reason, was at length assaulted by a crowd of

daring fanatics, who, from the twelfth to the sixteenth century,

assumed the popular character of reformers. The church of Rome

defended by violence the empire which she had acquired by fraud j

a system of peace and benevolence was soon disgraced by proscrip足

tions, wars, massacres, and the institution of the holy office. And

as the reformers were animated by the love of civil, as well as of

religious freedom, the Catholic princes connected their own interest

with that of the clergy, and enforced by fire and the sword the

terrors of spiritual censures. In the Netherlands alone, more

than one hundred thousand of the subjects of Charles the Fifth are

said to have suffered by the hand of the executioner; and this ex足

traordinary number is attested by Grotius ,?+, a man of genius and

learning, who preserved his moderation amidst the fury of contend足

ing sects, and who composed the annals of his own age and country,

at a time when the invention of printing had facilitated the means

of intelligence, and increased the danger of detection. If we are

obliged to submit our belief to the authority of Grotiue, it must be

allowed, that the number of Protestants, who were executed in a

single province, and a single reign, far exceeded that of the primitive

martyrs in the space of three centuries, and of the Roman empire.

But if the improbability of the fact itself should prevail over the

weight of evidence: if Grotius should be convicted of exaggerating

the merit and sufferings of the Reformers,8J; we shall be naturally

led to inquire, what confidence can be placed in the doubtful and

imperfect monuments of ancient credulity; what degree of credit can

be assigned to a courtly bishop, and a passionate declaimer, who,

under the protection of Constantine, enjoyed the exclusive privilege

of recording the persecutions, which Christianity had experienced

from the vanquished rivals or disregarded predecessors of their gra足

cious sovereign.
