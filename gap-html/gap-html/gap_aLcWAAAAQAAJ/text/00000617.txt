OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

Palestine may be considered as the sixteenth part of the Eastern

empire ,Sx; and since there were some governors, who from a real

or affected clemency had preserved their hands unstained with the

blood of the faithful,,J, it is reasonable to believe, that the country

which had given birth to Christianity produced at least the sixteenth

part of the martyrs who suffered death within the dominions of Ga-

leriusand Maximin; the whole might consequently amount to about

fifteen hundred, a number which, if it is equally divided between

the ten years of the persecution, will allow an annual consumption of

one hundred and fifty martyrs. Allotting the fame proportion to

the provinces of Italy, Africa, and perhaps Spain, where, at the

end of two or three years the rigour of the penal laws was either

suspended or abolished, the multitude of Christians in the Roman

empire on whom a capital punishment was inflicted by a judicial

sentence will be reduced to somewhat less than two thousand persons.

Since it cannot be doubted that the Ghristians were more numerous,

and their enemies more exasperated, in the time of Diocletian than

they had ever been in any former persecution, this probable and

moderate computation may teach us to estimate the number of pri­

mitive saints and martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the important

purpose of introducing Christianity into the world.

We (hall conclude this chapter by a melancholy truth, which ob- Conclusion,

trudes ijself on the reluctant mind; that even admitting, without

hesitation or inquiry, all that history has recorded, or'devotion has

feigned, on the subject of martyrdoms, it must still be acknowledged,

that the Christians, in the course of their intestine dissensions, have

•inflicted far greater severities on each other, than they had expe­

rienced from the zeal of infidels. During the ages of ignorance

• which followed the subversion of the Roman empire in the West,

the bishops of the imperial city extended their dominion over the

laity as well as clergy of the Latin church. The fabric of super­

stition which they had erected, and which might long have defied
