s20 THE DECLINE AND FALL

progress of Christianity. About fourscore years after the dtasti

of Christ, his innocent disciples were punished with death by the

sentence of a proconsul of the most amiable and philosophic cha­

racter, and according to the laws of an emperor, distinguished by

the wisdom and justice of his general administration. The apo­

logies which were repeatedly addressed to the successors of Trajan

are filled with the most pathetic complaints, that the Christians

who obeyed the dictates, and solicited the liberty of conscience, were

alone, among all the subjects of the Roman empire, excluded from

the common benefits of their auspicious government. The deaths

of a few eminent martyrs have been recorded with care; and from

the times that Christianity was invested with the supreme power, the

governors of the church have been no less diligently employed in

displaying the cruelty, than in imitating the conduct of their Pagan

adversaries. To separate (if it be possible) a few authentic as well as

interesting facts from an undigested mass of fiction and error, and

to relate, in a clear and rational manner, the causes, the extent, the

duration, and the most important circumstances of the persecutions

to which the first Christians were exposed, is the design of the

present chapter.

Srmo'Ses. The scctaries of a persecuted religion, depressed by fear, animated

with resentment, and perhaps heated by enthusiasm, are seld Dm in

a proper temper of mind calmly to investigate, or candidly to

appreciate, the motives of their enemies, which often escape the im­

partial and discerning view even of those who are placed at a secure

distance from the flames of persecution. A reason has been assigned

for the conduct of the emperors towards the primitive Christians,

which may appear the more specious and probable as it is drawn

from the acknowledged genius of Polytheism. It has already been

observed, that the religious concord of the world was principally

supported by the implicit assent and reverence which the nations of

antiquity expressed for their respective traditions and ceremonies.
