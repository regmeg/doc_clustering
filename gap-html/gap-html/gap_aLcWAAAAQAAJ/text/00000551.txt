the polite, however they might deride the miracles, would

have esteemed the virtues of the new sect; and that the ma­

gistrates, instead of persecuting, would have protected an order

it was invariably maintained by the faith of the people, the in­

credulity of philosophers, and the policy of the Roman senate and'

mild indifference of antiquity, and what new motives could urge
