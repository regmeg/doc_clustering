442 THE DECLINE AND FALL

grandson of Constantius 9\ The emperor himself had assumed the

more difficult and important province of the Danube. The Goths,

who in the time of Claudius and Aurelian had felt the weight

of the Roman arms, respected the power of the empire, even in the

midst of its intestine divisions. But the strength of that warlike

nation was now restored by a peace of near fifty years; a new

generation had arisen, who no longer remembered the misfortunes

of ancient days: the Sarmatians of the lake Maeotis followed the

Gothic standard either as subjects or as allies, and their united

force was poured upon the countries of Illyricum. Campona,

Margus, and Bononia, appear to have been the scenes of several

memorable sieges and battles"; and though Constantine en­

countered a very obstinate resistance, he prevailed at length in the

, contest, and the Goths were compelled to purchase an ignominious

retreat by restoring the booty aad prisoners which they had taken.

Nor was this advantage sufficient to satisfy the indignation of the

emperor. He resolved to chastise as well as to repulse the insolent barba­

rians who had dared to invade the territories of Rome. At the head

of his legions he passed the Danube, on the bridge which had been

constructed by Trajan, penetrated into the strongest recestes of

Dacia *co, and when he had inflicted a severe revenge, condescended

i to give peace to the suppliant Goths, on condition that, as often

as they were required, they mould supply his armies with a body

of forty thousand soldiers "". Exploits like these were no doubt

honourable to Constantine and beneficial to the state; but it may

surely be questioned whether they can justify the exaggerated as­

sertion of Eusebius, that all Scythia, as far as the extremity of

the North, divided as it was into so many names and nations of the

most various and savage manners, had been added by bis victorious

arms to the Roman empire ,c\
