denly left him, and they returned as suddenly upon

the murder of that excellent prince. Dio, 1. lxxiii.

[43] The prefects were changed almost hourly

or daily; and the caprice of Commodus was often

fatal to his most favoured chamberlains. Hist.

[45] Pertinax was a native of Alba Pompeia, in

Piedmont, and son of a timber merchant. The

order of his employments (it is marked by Capi-

tolinus) well deserves to be set down as expressive

of the form of government and manners of the

age. 1. He was a centurion, 2. Præfect of a

cohort in Syria, in the Parthian war, and in Bri­

tain. 3. He obtained an Ala, or squadron of horse,

in Maesia. 4. He was commissary of provisions

00 the Æmilian way. ;. He commanded the fleet

upon the Rhine. 6. He was procurator of Dacia,

with a salary of about i6col. a year. 7. He

commanded the Veterans of a legion. 8. He ob­

tained the rank of senator. 9. Of prætor. 10.

With the command of the first legion in Rhætia and

Noricum. 11. He was consul about the year 17;.

12. He attended Marcus into the east. 13. He

commanded an army on the Danube. 14. He was

consular legate of Mæsia. 15. Us Dacia. 16.

Of Syria. 17. Of Britain. 18. He had the care

of the public provisions at Rome. 19. He was

proconsul of Africa. 20. Præfect of the city. He­

rodian (1. i. p. 48.) does justice to his disinterested

spirit; but Capitolinus, who collected every popu­

lar rumor, charges him with a great fortune ac­

quired by bribery and corruption.

[46] Julian, in the Cæsars, taxes him with being

accessary to the death of Commodus.

[47] Capitolinus gives us the particulars of these

tumultuary votes which were moved by one senator,

and repeated, or rather chanted by the whole body.

Hist. August, p. 52.

[48] The senate condemned Nero to be put to

death mort majerum. Sueton. c. 49.

[49] Dio (1. lxxiii. p. 1223) speaks of these

entertainments, as a senator who had supped with

the emperor. Capitolinus (Hist. August, p. 58.)

like a slave, who had received his intelligence from

one of the scullions.

[50] Decies. The blameless oeconomy of Pius, left

his successors a treasure of view ftptitt milliu, above

two and twenty millions sterling. Dio, 1. lxxiii.

p. 1231.

[51] Besides the design of converting these use­

less ornaments into money. Dio (1. lxxiii. p. 1229.)

assigns two secret motives of Pertinax. He wished

to expose the vices of Commodus, and to disco­

ver by the purchasers those who most resembled

him.

[ 5 2] Though Capiteliftut has picked up many idle

tales of the private life of Pertinax, he joins with

Dio and Herodian in admiring his public conduct.

[^4] If we credit Capitolinns (which is rather

difficult) Falco behaved with the most petulant in­

decency to Pertinax, on the day of his accession.

The wife emperor only admonished him of his

youth and inexperience. Hist. August, p. 55.

[55] The modern bishopric of Liege. This

soldier probably belonged to the Batavian horse-

guards, who were mostly raised in the dntchy of

Gueldres and the neighbourhood, and were distin­

guished by their valour, and by the boldnese with

which they swam their horses acrose the broadest

and most rapid rivers. Tacit. Hist., iv. 12. Dio,
