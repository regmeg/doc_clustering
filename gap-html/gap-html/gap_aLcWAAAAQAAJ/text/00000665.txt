NOTES ON THE ELEVENTH CHAPTER. xlv

non in Centura totius vitæ ac severitate militari

Pertinacem vel Severum. Sed omnia hæc libido,

et cupiditas voluptatis mulierariæ sic perdidit, ut

nemo audeat virtutes ejus in literal mitten quern

constat omnium judicio meruisse puniri.

two last (but with strong probability) place die fall

of Tetricus before that of Zenobia. M. de Boze

(in the Academy of Inscriptions, torn, xxx.) does

not wish, and Tillemont (torn, iii. p. 1189.) does

not dare, to follow them. I have been fairer than

the one, and bolder than the other.

[54] Almost every thing that is said of the man­

ners of Odenathus and Zenobia, is taken from

♦heir lives in the Augustan History, by Trebellius

Pollio, see p. 192. 198.

[55] She never admitted her husband's embraces

but for the fake of posterity. If her hopes were

baffled, in the ensuing month (he reiterated the ex­

periment.

[56] Hist. August, p. 192, 193. Zosimus, 1. i.

p. 36. Zonaras, 1. xii. p. 633. The last is clear

and. probable, the others confused and inconsistent.

The text of Syncellus, if not corrupt, is absolute

nonsense.

[57] Odenathus and Zenobia, often sent him

from the. spoils of the enemy, presents of gems, and

toys, which he received with infinite delight.

f 58J Some very unjust suspicions have been cast

on Zenobia, as if she was accessary to her husband's

death.

[60] See in Hist. August, p. 198. Aurelian's

testimony to her merit, and for the conquest of

Egypt. Zosimus, 1. i. p. 39, 40.

[61] Timolaus, Herennianus, and Vaballathus.

It is supposed that the two former were already

dead before the war. On the last, Aurelian be­

stowed a small province of Armenia with the tide

of king ; several of his medals are still extant. See

Tillemont, torn. iii. p. 1190.

[62] Zosimus, 1. i. p. 44.

[63] Vopiscus (in Hist. August, p. 217.) gives

us an authentic letter, and a doubtful vision of

Aurelian. Apollonius of Tyana was born about

the fame time as Jesus Christ. His life (that of

the former) is related in so sabulous a manner by

his fanatic disciples, that we are at a loss to dis­

cover whether he was a sage or an impostor.

[64] Zosimus, 1. i. p. 46.

[65] At a place called Immæ. Eutropius, Sextus

Rufus, and Jerome, mention only this first battle.

[66] Vopiscus in Hist. August, p. Z17, men­

tions only the second.

[67] Zosimus, !. i. p. 44.—48. His account of

the two battles is clear and circumstantial.

[68] It was five hundred and thirty-seven miles

from Seleucia, and two hundred and three from the

nearest coast of Syria, according to the reckoning of

Pliny, who, in a few words (Hist. ?\atur. v. 11.)

gives an excellent description of Palmyra.

[69] Some Englilh travellers from Aleppo dis­

covered the ruins of Palmyra, about the end of the last

century. Our curiosity has since been gratified.in a .

more splendid manner by Messieurs Wood and Daw-

kins. For the history of Palmyra, we may con­

sult the masterly dissertation os Dr. Halley in the

Philosophical Transactions; Lowthorp's Abridge­

ment, vol. iii. p. 518.

[71] From a very doubtful chronology I have

endeavoured to extract the.most probable date.
