These obscure teachers (such was the charge of malice and infidelity)

are as mute in public as they are loquacious and dogmatical in

private. Whilst they cautiously avoid the dangerous encounter of

philosophers, they mingle with the rude and illiterate crowd,' and

insinuate themselves into those minds, whom their age, their sex, or
