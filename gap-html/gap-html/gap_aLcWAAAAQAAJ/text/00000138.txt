Proportion 'I * H E power of the sword is more sensibly felr in an exten-

tary force, to J- five monarchy, than in a small community. It has been

of Unpeople, calculated by the ablest politicians, that no state, without
being soon

exhausted, can maintain above the hundredth part of its members in

arms and idleness. But although this relative proportion may be

uniform, its influence over the rest of the society will vary according

to the degree of its positive strength. The advantages of military

science and discipline cannot be exerted, unless a proper number of

soldiers are united into one body, and actuated by one soul. With a

handful of men, such a union would be ineffectual; with an unwieldy

host, it would be impracticable; and the powers of the machine would

be alike destroyed by the extreme minuteness, or the excessive weight

of its springs. To illustrate this observation we need only reflect,

that there is no superiority of natural strength, artificial weapons, or

acquired (kill, which could enable one man to keep in constant sub­

jection a hundred of his fellow-creatures: the tyrant of a single

town, or a small district, would soon discover that an hundred armed

/followers were a weak defence against ten thousand peasants or ci­

tizens; but a hundred thousand well-disciplined soldiers will com­

mand)
