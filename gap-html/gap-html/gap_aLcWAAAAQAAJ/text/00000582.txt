y5o THE DECLINE AND FALL

tors. His faithful presbyters and deacons were permitted to accom*

pany their holy bishop. They assisted him in laying aside his upper

garment, spread linen on the ground to receive the precious relics

of hie blood, and received his orders to bestow five-and twenty pieces

of gold on the executioner. The martyr then covered his face with

hie hands, and at one blow his head was severed from his body*

His corpse remained during some hours exposed to the curiosity of

the Gentiles: but in the night it was removed, and transported in

a triumphal procession and with a splendid illumination to the burial-

place of the Christians. The funeral of Cyprian was publickly cele足

brated without receiving any interruption from the Roman magis足

trates; and those among the faithful who had performed the last

offices to his person and his memory were secure from the danger of

inquiry or of punishment. It is remarkable, that of so great a

multitude of bishops in the province of Africa, Cyprian was the first

who was esteemed worthy to obtain the crown of martyrdom *T.

Various In- It was in the choice of Cyprian either to die a martyr or to live

martyrdom, an apostate: but on that choice depended the alternative of honour

or infamy. Could we suppose that the Bishop of Carthage had em足

ployed the profession of the Christian faith only as the instrument

of his avarice or ambition, it was still incumbent on him to support

the character which he had assumed 88; and, if he possessed the

smallest degree of manly fortitude, rather to expose himself to the

most cruel tortures, than by a single act to exchange the reputation

of a whole life, for the abhorrence of his Christian brethren and

the contempt of the Gentile world. But if the zeal of Cyprian was

supported by the sincere conviction of the truth of those doctrines

which he preached, the crown of martyrdom must have appeared

to him as an object of desire rather than of terror. It is not easy to

extract any distinct ideas from the vague though eloquent declama足

tions of the Fathers, or to ascertain the degree of immortal glory

and happiness which they confidently promised to those who were

so
