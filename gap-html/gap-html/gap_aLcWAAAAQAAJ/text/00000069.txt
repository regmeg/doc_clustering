OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

By a race of soldiers; and the veterans, whether they received the

reward of their service in land or in money, usually settled with

their families in the country, where they had honourably spent

their youth* Throughout the empire, but more particularly in the

western parts, the most fertile districts, and the most convenient

situations, were reserved for the establishment of colonies; some of

which were of a civil, and others of a military nature. In their

manners and internal policy, the colonies formed a perfect repre­

sentation of their great parent; and as they were soon endeared to

the natives by the ties of friendship and alliance, they effectually

cities,to which it had been granted, a more partial favour. The

magistrates only, at the expiration of their office, assumed the

quality of Roman citizens; bat as those offices were annual, in-a

were rewarded with a present, whose value was continually di­

minished by the increasing, liberality ,of the emperors. Yet even,

in the age of the Antonines, when the freedom of the city had been

bestowed on the greater number of their subjects, it was still accom­

panied with very solid advantages. The bulk of the people ac*

quired, with that title, the benefit of the Roman, laws, particularly

in the interesting articles of marriage, testaments, and inheritances,

and the road of fortune was open to those whose pretensions were
