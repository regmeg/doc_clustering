NOTES ON THE FIFTEENTH CHAPTER. Ixxiii

[130] Irenrus adv. Hæres. I. iv. c. 27. 34. Ori-

gen in Num. Horn. ii. Cyprian de Unitat. Eccles.

Conslitut. Apostol. 1. ii. c. 34, 35, with the notes

of Cotelerius. The constitutions introduce this

divine precept, by declaring that priests are as much

above kings, as the soul is above the body. Among

the tytbable articles, they enumerafe corn, wine,

cil, arid wool. On this interesting subject, consult

Prideaux's FF.story of Tythes, and Fra Paolo dclle

Materie Benesiciarie; two writers of a very differ,

ent character.

[131] The fame opinion which prevailed about

the year one thousand, was productive of the fame

effects. Most of the Donations express their mo­

tive, " appropinquante mundi fine." See Mo-

sheim's General History ofthe Church, vol. i.p. 457.

The subsequent conduct of the deacon Laurence,

only proves how proper a use was made of the

wealth of the Roman church: it was undoubtedly

very considerable; but Fra Paolo (c. 3.) appears to

Exaggerate, when he supposes, that the successors of

Conimodus were urged to persecute the christians

by their own avarice, or that of their Praetorian

praefects.

[133] Cyprian. Epistol. 62.

[134] Tertullian de Prescriptione, c. 30.

[135] Hist. August, p. 131, The ground had

been public; and was now disputed between the

society os christians, and that of butchers.

[136} Diocletian gave a rescript, which is only

a declaration of the old law; '' Collegium, si nullo

speciali privilegio subnixuni sit, hæreditatem ca-

pere non posse, dubium non est." Fra-Paolo (c 4.)

Vol. I.

thinks that these regulations had been much ne­

glected since the reign of Valerian.

[137] Constitut. Apostol. ii. 35.

[138] Cyprian de Lapsis, p. 89. Epistol. 65.

The charge is confirmed by the 19th and 2Cth canon

of the council of llliberis.

[ 13 9] See the apologies of Justin, Tertullian, Sec.

[140] The wealth and liberality of the Romans

to their most distant brethren, is gratefully cele­

brated by Dionystus of Corinth, ap. Euseb. 1. iv.

c. 23-.

[141] See Lucian in Peregrin. Julian (Epist.

49.) seems mortified, that the christian charity main­

tains not only their own, but likewise the heathen

poor.

[141] Such, at least, has been the laudable con­

duct of more modern missionaries, under the fame

circumstances. Above three thousand new-born

infants are annually exposed in the streets of Pekin.

(143] The Montanists and the Novatians, who

adhered to this opinion with the greatest rigour

and obstinacy, found thtmstlvts at last in the num­

ber of excommunicated heretics. See the learned

and copious Molheim, Secul. ii. and iii.

• [144] Dionyfius, ap. Eufeb. iv. 23. Cyprian, de

Lapsis.

5. The admirers of antiquity regret the loss of

this public pennance.

[146] See in Dupin, Bibliotheque Ecclesiastique,

torn. ii. p. 304—313, a short but rational exposition

of the canons of those councils, which were assem­

bled in the first moments of tranquillity, after the

persecution of Diocletian. This persecution had

been much less severely felt in Spain than in Gala-

tia; a difference which may, in some measure, ac­

count for the contrast of their regulations.

[148] Thearts, the manners, and the vices of

the priests of the Syrian goddess, are very humour­
