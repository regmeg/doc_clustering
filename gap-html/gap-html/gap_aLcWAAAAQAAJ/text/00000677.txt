NOTES ON THE THIRTEENTH CHAPTER. Ivii

Aurel. Victor, who has treated the character of

Diocletian with good fense, though in bad Latin.

[ic6] Solus omnium, post conditum Romanum

Imperium, qui cx tanto falligio fponte ad privatæ

vit<e datum civilitatemque remearet. Hutrop.

ix. 28.

[107] The particulars of the journey and illness

are taken from Lactantius (c. 17,) who may sometimes

be admitted as an evidence of public facts, though

very seldom of private anecdotes.

[108] Aurelius Victor ascribes the abdication,

which had been so variously accounted for, to two

causes. 1st, Diocletian's contempt of ambition;

and 2dly, His apprehension of impending troubles.

One of the panegyrists (vi. 9 ) mentions the age

and infirmities of Diocletian, as a very natural

reason for his retirement.

[icq] The difficulties as well as mistakes at­

tending the dates both of the year and of the day of

Diocletian's abdication, arc perfectly cleared up by

Tillemont, Hist, des Empereurs, torn. iv. p. 525.

Note 19, and by Pagi ad annum.

[110] See Panegyr. Veter. vi. 9. The oration

was pronounced after Maximian had reaslumed the

purple. »

[111] Eumenius pays him a very fine compliment,

"At enim divinum ilium virum, qui primus Im-

"perium et participavit et posuit, consilii et facti

"sui non pœnitet; nec amisiile se putat quod sponte

"transcripsit. F.elix beatusque vere quem vestra,

*' tantorum principum, colunt obsequia privatum."  
Panegyr. Vet. vii. 15.

[ 11 z] We are obliged to the younger Victor for

this celebrated bon mft. Eutropius mentions the

thing in a more general manner.

[113] Hist. August, p. Z23 224. Vopiscus had

learned this conversation from his father.

[114] The younger Victor slightly mentions the

report. But as Diocletian had disobliged a power­

ful and successful party, his memory has been

loaded with every crime and misfortune. It has

been affinred that he died raving mad, that he was

condemned as a ciiminal by the Roman senate, &c.

[116] The Abate Fortis, in his Viaggio in Dal-

mazia, p. 43. (printed at Venice, in the year 1774,

in two small volumes in quarto) quotes a MS.

account of the antiquities of Salona, composed by

Giambattiila Giustiniani about the middle of the

xvith century.

[117] Adam's antiquities of Diocletian's palace

at Spalatro, p. 6. We may add a circumstance or

two from the -Abate Fortis: the little stream of

the Hyader, mentioned by Lucan, produces most

exquisite trout, which a sagacious writer, perhaps

a monk, supposes to have been one of the principal

reasons that determined Diocletian in the choice of

his retirement. Fortis, p. 45. The fame author

(p. 38.) observes, that a taile for agriculture is

reviving at Spalatro; and that an experimental farm

has lately been established near the city, by a

society of Gentlemen.

In this sermon, the emperor, or the biffiop who com­

posed it for him, affects to relate the miserable end

of all the persecutors of the church.

[121] Mesfieurs Adam and Clerisseau, attended

by two draughtsmen, visited Spalatro in the month

os July 1757. The magnificent work which their

journey produced, was publifned in London seven

years afterwards.
