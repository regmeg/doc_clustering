NOTES ON THE TENTH CHAPTER. xli

[136] Zosimus, 1. i. p. 33.

[137] Hist. August, p. 174.

[138] Victor n Cæsar. Eutropius, ix. 7.

[139] Zosimus, 1. i. p. 33. Zonaras, I. xii. p.

630. Peter Pacricius in the Excerpta Legat. p. 29.

[140] Hist. August, p. 185. The reign of Cy-

riades appears in that collection prior to the death

of Valerian; but I have preferred a probable series

of events to the doubtful chronology of a most in­

accurate writer.

[141] The sack of Antioch, anticipated by some

historians, is assigned, by the decisive testimony of

Ammianus Marcellinus, to the reign of Gallienus,

xxiii. 5.

[142] Zosimus, 1. i. p. 3;.

[143] John Malala, torn. i. p. 391. He cor­

rupts this probable event by some fabulous circum­

stances.

[144] Zonaras, 1. xii. p. 630. Deep rallies were

filled up with the stain. Crowds of prisoners were

driven to water like beasts, and many perished for

want of food.

[14;] Zosimus, 1. i. p. 2;, asserts, that Sapor,

had he not preferred spoil to conquest, might have

remained master of Asia.

[146] Peter Patricius in Excerpt. Leg. p. 29.

£147] Syrorum Agrestium manu. Sextus Rasas,

c 23. Rufus, Victor, the Augustan History (p. 192.),

and several inscriptions agree in making Odenathus

a citizen of Palmyra.

[148] He possessed so powerful an interest among

the wandering tribes, that Procopius (Bell. Persic.

1. ii. c. 5.) and John Malala (torn. i. p. 391.) style

him Prince of the Saracens.

[149] Peter Patricius, p. 25.

[150] The Pagan writers lament, the Christian

insult, the misfortunes of Valerian. Their various

testimonies are accurately collected by Tillemont,

torn. iii. p. 739, &c. So little has been preserved

of Eastern history before Mahomet, that the mo­

dern Persians are totally ignorant of the victory of

Vol. I.

Sapor, an event so glorious to their nation. See

Bibliotheque Orient ale.

[151] Cne of these epistles is from Artavasdes,

king of Armenia: since Armenia was then a pro­

vince to Persia, the king, the kingdom, and the

epistle, must be fictitious.

[152] See his life in the Augustan History.

[153] There is still extant a very pretty Epitha-

lamium, composed by Gallienus, for the nuptials of

his nephews.

Ite ait, O Juvenes, pariter fudate medullis

Omnibus, inter vos ; non murmura vestra columbæ

Brachia non Hederae, non vincant oscula Conchæ.

[154] He was on the point of giving Plotinus a

ruined city of Campania, to try the experiment of

realizing Plato's Republic. See the Life of Ploti-

inus, by Porphyry, in Fabricius's Biblioth. Grxc.

1. iv.

[ 15 j] This singular character has, I believe, been

fairly transmitted to us. The reign of his imme­

diate siiccessor was short and busy; and the histo­

rians who wrote before the elevation of the family

of Constantine, could not have the most remote

interest to misrepresent the character of Gallienas.

[156] Pollio expresses the most minute anxiety

to complete the number.

[157] The place of his reign is somewhat doubt­

ful; but there no as a tyrant in Pontus, and we are

acquainted with the feat of all the others.

[158] Tillemont, torn. iii. p. 1163, reekons them

somewhat differently.

[159] See the speech of Marius, in the Augustan

History, p. 197. The accidental identity of names

was the only circumstance that could tempt Pollio

to imitate Sallust,

[160] Vos O Fompilius fanguis ! is Horace's ad­

dress to the Pisos. See Art. Poet. v. 292, with

Dacier's and Sanadon's notes.

[161] Tacit. Annal. xv. 48. Hist i. 15. In the

former of these passages we may venture to change

fattrna into materna. In every generation from

Augustus to Alexander Severus, one or more Pisos

appear as consuls. A Piso was deemed worthy of
