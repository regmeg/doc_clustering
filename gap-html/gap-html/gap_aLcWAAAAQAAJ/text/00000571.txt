OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

But although the obscurity of the house of David might protect Execution of

them from the suspicions of a tyrant, the present greatness of his consul,

own family alarmed the pusillanimous temper of Domitian, which

could only be appeased by the blood of those Romans whom he

either feared, or hated, or esteemed. Of the two sons of his uncle

Flavius Sabinus s°, the elder was soon convicted of treasonable in­

tentions, and the younger, who bore the name of Flavius Clemens,

the latter, who had enjoyed the favour, but who had not surely
