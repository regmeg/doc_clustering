OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 461.

It has been remarked with more ingenuity than truth, that the The!r {5ct'»

0 ■ 4 progress, and

virgin purity of the church was never violated by schism or herely influence,

before the reign of Trajan or Hadrian, about one hundred years after

the death of Christ !o. We may observe with much more propriety,

that, during that period, the disciples of the Messiah were indulged

in a freer latitude both of faith and practice, than has ever been

allowed in succeeding ages. As the terms of communion were

insensibly narrowed, and. the spiritual authority of the prevailing

party was exercised with increasing severity, many of its most

respectable adherents, who were called upon to renounce, were

provoked to assert, their private opinions, to pursue the consequences

of their mistaken principles, and openly to erect the standard of

rebellion against the unity of the church. The Gnostics were dis­

tinguished as the most polite, the most learned, and the most

wealthy of the Christian name, and that general appellation which

expressed a superiority of knowledge, was either assumed by their

own pride, or ironically bestowed by the envy of their adversaries^

They were almost without exception of the race of the Gentiles,

and their principal founders seem to have been natives of Syria

or Egypt> where the warmth of the climate disposes both the mind

and the body to contemplative devotion. The Gnostics blended

with the faith of Christ many sublime but obscure tenets, which

they derived from oriental philosophy, and even from the religion

of Zoroaster, concerning the eternity of matter, the existence of

two principles, and the mysterious hierarchy of the invisible world

As soon as they launched out into that vast abyss, they delivered

themselves to the guidance of a disordered imagination; and as

the paths of error are various and infinite, the Gnostics were

imperceptibly divided into more than fifty particular sects '% of

whom the most celebrated appear to have been the Basilidians^

the Yalentinians, the Marcionites, and, in a still later period, the

% Manichæans*.
