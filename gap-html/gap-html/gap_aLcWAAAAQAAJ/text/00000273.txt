OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

leader; his camp became their country, and some circumstance of

the enterprise soon gave a common denomination to the mixed mul足

titude. The distinctions of the ferocious invaders were perpetually

varied by themselves, and confounded by the astonished subjects of

the Roman empire86.

Wars, and the administration of public affairs, are the principal Numbers

subjects of history; but the number of persons interested in these

busy scenes, is very different according to the different condition

of mankind. In great monarchies, millions of obedient subjects

pursue their useful occupations in peace and obscurity. The atten足

tion of the Writer, as well as of the Reader, is solely confined to a

court, a capital, a regular army, and the districts which happen to be

the occasional scene of military operations. But a state of freedom and

barbarism, the season of civil commotions, or the situation of petty re足

publics 8% raises almost every member of the community into action and

consequently into notice. The irregular divisions, and the restless mo足

tions of the people of Germany, dazzle our imagination, and seem

to multiply their numbers. The profuse enumeration of kings and

warriors, of armies and nations, inclines us to forget that the fame

objects are continually repeated under a variety of appellations, and

that the most splendid appellations have been frequently lavished on

the most inconsiderable objects.
