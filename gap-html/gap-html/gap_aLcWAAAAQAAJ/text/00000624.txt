plained by M. Guichard, Nouveaux Memoires,

[6;J Tacitus (Annal. iv. 5) has given us a state

of the legions under Tiberius: and Dion Caslius

(1. Iv. p. 794) under Alexander Severus. I have

endeavoured to fix on the proper medium between

those two periods. See likewise Lipsius de Mag-

nitudine Romana, 1. i. c. 4, 5.

[66J The Romans tried to disguise, by the pre­

tence of religious awe, their ignorance and terror.

See Tacit. Germania, c. 34.

[67] Plutarch, in Marc. Anton. And yet if we

may credit Orosius, these monstrous castles were no

more than ten feet above the water, vi. 19.

[68] See Lipsius, de Magnitud. Rom. 1. i. c. 5.

The sixteen last chapters of Vegetius relate to na­

val affairs.

[69] Voltaire, Siecle de Louis XIV. c. 29. It

must, however, be remembered, that France still

feels that extraordinary effort.

[70] See Strabo, 1. ii. It is natural enoug h to

suppose, that Arragonis derived from Tarraconensis,

and several moderns who have written in Latin,

use those words as synonymous. It is however

certain, that the Arragon, a little stream which

falls from the Pyrenees into the Ebro, first gave

its name to a county, and gradually to a king­

dom. See Danville, Geographie du Moyen Age,

p. 181.

[71] One hundred and fifteen titkt appear in

the Notitia of Gaul. But Plutarch and Appian

increase the number of tribes to three or fcur

hundred.

[74] The Italian Veneti, though often confound­

ed with the Gauls, were more probably of Illyrian

origin. See M. Freret, Memoires de P Academic

■des Inscriptions, torn, xviii.

[75] See Maffei Verona illustrata, 1. i.

[76] The first contrast was observed by the

ancients. See Florus, i. 11, The second must

strike every modern traveller.

sion of Italy, by Augustus.

Mineure, lettre xviii.

[79] The name of Illyricum, originally belonged

to the sea coast of the Hadriatic, and was gradually

extended by the Romans from the Alps to the

Euxine Sea. See Severini Pannonia, 1. i. c, 3.

[So] A Venetian traveller, the Abbate Foitis,

has lately given us some account os those very ob­

scure countries. But the geography and anti­

quities of the western illyricum, can be expected

only from the munificence of the emperor, its

sovereign:

[81] The.Save rises near the confines of Jfiria,

and was considered by the more early Greeks as the

principal stream of the Danube.

[82J See the Periplus of Arrian. He examined

the coasts of the Euxine, when he was governor of

Cappadocia.

[83J The progress of religion is well known.

The use of letters was introduced among the sa­

vages of Europe about fifteen hundred years

before Christ; and the Europeans carried them to

America, about fifteen centuries after the Christian

sera. But in a period of three thousand years,

the Phœnician alphabet received considerable al­

terations, as it passed through the hands of the

Greeks and Romans.
