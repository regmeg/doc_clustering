;7o THE DECLINE AND FALL

ment, of the Christians, it was thought necessary to subject to the most

intolerable hardships the condition of those perverse individuals who

should still reject the religion of Nature, of Rome, and of their

ancestors. Persons of a liberal birth were declared incapable of

holding any honours or employments; slaves were for ever deprived

of the hopes of freedom, and the whole bo#y of the people were

put out of the protection of the law. The judges were authorized

to hear and to determine every action that was brought against a

Christian. But the Christians were not permitted to complain of

any injury which they themselves had suffered; and thus those un­

fortunate sectaries were exposed to the severity, while they were ex­

cluded from the benefits, of public justice. This new species of mar­

tyrdom, so painful and lingering, so obscure and ignominious, was,

perhaps, the most proper to weary the constancy of the faithful:

nor can it be doubted that the pallions and interest of mankind were

disposed on this occasion to second the designs of the emperors. But

the policy of a well-ordered government must sometimes have in­

terposed in behalf of the oppressed Christians; nor was it possible

for the Roman princes entirely to remove the apprehension of

punishment, or to connive at every act of fraud and violence, with­

out exposing their own authority and the rest of their subjects to

the most alarming dangers ,f\

Zeal and pj- This edict was scarcely exhibited to the public view, in the most

christian. conspicuous place of Nicomedia, before it was torn down by the

hands of a Christian, who expressed, at the fame time, by the bit­

terest invectives, his contempt as well as abhorrence for such im>

pious and tyrannical governors. His offence, according to the

mildest laws, amounted to treason, and deserved death. And if it

fee true that he was a person of rank and education, those circum­

stances could serve only to aggravate his guilt. He was burnt, or

rather roasted, by a slow sire; and bis executioners, zealous to re­

venge the personal insult which had been offered to the emperors*
