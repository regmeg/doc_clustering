beyond the narrow limits of the promised land 1That obstacle was

indeed removed by the destruction of the temple of Jerusalem; but

the most considerable part of the Jewish religion was involved in its

destruction; and the pagans, who had long wondered at the strange

report of an empty sanctuary '% were at a loss to discover what

announced and prepared the long expected coming of the Messiah,

who, in compliance with the gross apprehensions of the Jews, had

been more frequently represented under the character of a King and

Conqueror, than under that of a Prophet, a Martyr, and the Son
