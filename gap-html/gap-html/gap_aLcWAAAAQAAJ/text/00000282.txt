the Roman territories was far more alluring ; and the fields- of

Dacia were covered with rich harvests, sown by the hands of an in­

It is probable, that the conquests of Trajan, maintained by his suc­

cessors, less for any real advantage, than for ideal dignity, had

contributed to weaken the empire on that side. The new and un­

the emperor Decius, that Cniva, king of the Goths, bad passed

the Danube a second time, with more considerable forces; that
