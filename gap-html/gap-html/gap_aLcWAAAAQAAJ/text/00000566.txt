534 THE DECLINE AND FALL

Those who survey with a curious eye the revolutions of mankind,

may observe, that the gardens and circus of Nero on the Vatican,

.which were polluted with the blood of the first Christians, have been

throne of the Cæsars, given laws to the barbarian conquerors of

Rome, and extended their spiritual jurisdiction from the coast of the

Baltic to the banks of the Pacific Ocean.

But it would be improper to dismiss this account of Nero's per­

secution, till we have made some observations, that may serve to

remove the difficulties with which it is perplexed, and to throw

some light on the subsequent history of the church.

who had embraced a new and criminal superstition 3*. The latter is

warranted by the consent of the most ancient manuscripts; by the
