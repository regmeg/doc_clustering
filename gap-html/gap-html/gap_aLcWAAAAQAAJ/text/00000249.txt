OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

CHAP. IXr.

The State of Germany till the invasion of the Barhariam>

in the time of the Emperor Decius.

'TT^HE government and religion of Persia have deserved some

**■ notice from their connexion with the decline and fall of the  
Roman empire. We shall occasionally mention the Scythian, or

Sarmatian tribes, that, with their arms and horses, their flocks and

herds, their wives and families, wandered over the immense plains

which spread themselves from the Caspian Sea to the Vistula, from

the confines of Persia to those of Germany. But the warlike Ger­

mans, who first resisted, then invaded, and at length overturned

the western monarchy of Rome, will occupy a much more im­

portant place in this history, and pofless a stronger, and, if we may

use the expression, a more domestic claim to our attention and

regard. The most civilized nations of modern Europe issued from

the woods of Germany, and in the rude institutions of those harha-

rians, we may still distinguish the original principles of our pre­

sent laws and manners. In their primitive state of simplicity and

independence, the Germans were surveyed by the discerning eye,

and delineated by the masterly pencil of Tacitus, the first of his­

torians who applied the science of philosophy to the study of facts.

In his incomparable treatise, which contains, perhaps, more ideas

than words, he has comprehended a description of the German

manners, that has formerly exercised the diligence of innumerable

antiquarians, and employed the genius and penetration of the philo­

sophic historians of our own times. The subject, however various

and important, has already been so frequently, so ably, and so
