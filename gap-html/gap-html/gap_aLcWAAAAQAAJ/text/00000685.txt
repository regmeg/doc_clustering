NOTES ON THE FIFTEENTH CHAPTER. Ixv

[105] Constantine was very attentive to the pri­

vileges and comfort of his fellow-veterans (Conve-

terant), as he now began to style them. See the

Theodosia-n Code, 1. vii. tit. 20. torn. ii. p.

419—429.

[106] Whilst the Athenians maintained the em­

pire of the sea, their fleet consisted of three, and

afterwards of four, hundred gallies of three ranks of

oars, all completely equipped and ready for imme­

diate service. The arsenal in the port of Piraus

had cost the republic a thousand talents, about

two hundred and sixteen thousand pounds. See

Thucydides de Eel. Peloponn. 1. ii. c. 13. and

Meursius de Fortuna Attica, c. 19.

[107] Zosimus, 1. ii. p. 95, 96. This great

battle is described in the Valesian fragment (p.

714.), in a clear though concise manner. " Licinius

vero circum Hadrianopolin maximo exercitu la-

teraardui montis impleverat: illuctoto agmineCon-

stantinus inflexit. Cum bellum terra marique tra-

heretur, quamvis per arduum suis nitentibus, atta-

m'en difciplina militari et felicitate, Constantinus Li-

cinii confusum et fine ordine agentem vicit exerci-

tum; leviter femore sauciatus."

[108] Zosimus, 1. ii. p. 97, 98. The current

always sets out of the Hellespont; and when it is

assisted by a north wind, no vessel can attempt the

passage. A south wind renders the force of the cur­

rent almost imperceptible. See Tournefort's Voyage

au Levant, Let. xi.

[109] Aureliu3 Victor. Zosimus, 1. ii. p. 98.

According to the latter, Martinianus was Magister

Officiorum (he uses the Latin appellation in Greek).

Some medals seem to intimate, that during his stiort

reign he received the title of Augustus.

[11c] Eusebius (in Vita Constantin. 1. ii. c. 16,

17.) ascribes this decisive victory to the pious

prayers of the emperor. The Valesian fragment

(p. 714.) mentions a body of Gothic auxiliaries,

under their chief Aliquaca, who adhered to the

party of Licinius.

Epitome. Anonym. Valesian. p. 714.

[112] Contra religionem sacramenti. Thessa-

lonicæ privatus occifus est. Eutropius x. 6. and his

evidence is confirmed by St. Jerome (in Chronic.) a*

well as by Zosimus, 1. ii p. 102. The Valesian

writer is the only one who mentions the soldiers,

and it is Zonaras alone who calls in the assistance*

of the senate. Eusebius prudently slides over this

delicate transaction. But Sozomen, a century af­

terwards, ventures to assert the treasonable practices

of Licinius.

[113] See the Theodosian Code, 1. xv. tit. 15.

torn. v. p. 404, 405. These edicts of Constantine

betray a degree of passion and precipitancy very un­

becoming of the character of a lawgiver.
