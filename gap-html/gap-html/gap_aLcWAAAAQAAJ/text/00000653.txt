NOTES ON THE NINTH CHAPTER. xxxiii

fn] The Romans made war in all climates,

and by their excellent discipline were in a great

measure preserved in health and vigour. It may

be remarked, that man is the only animal which

can live and multiply in every country from the

equator to the poles. The hog seems to approach

the nearest to our species in that privilege.

the Gauls followed the course of the Danube, and

discharged itself on Greece and Asia. Tacitus

could discover only one inconsiderable tribe that

retained any traces of a Gallic origin.

[13] According to Dr. Keating, (History of

Ireland, p. 13, 14.J the giant Partholanus, who

was the son of Seara, the son of Esra, the son of

Sru, the son of Framant, the son of Fathaclan, the

son of Magog, the son of Japhet, the son of Noah,

landed on the coast of Munster, the 14th day of

May, in the year of the world one thousand nine

hundred and seventy-eight. Though he succeeded

in his great enterprise, the loose behaviour of his

wife rendered his domestic life very unhappy, and

provoked him to such a degree, that he killed—

her favourite greyhound. This, as the learned

historian very properly observes, was the first

instance of female falsehood and infidelity ever

known in Ireland.

contented with this decisive authority, without

entering into the obscure disputes concerning the

antiquity of the Runic characters. The learned

Celsius, a Swede, a scholar, and a philosopher,

was of opinion, that they were nothing more than

the Roman letters, with the curves changed into

strait lines for the ease of engraving. See Pel-

loutier, Histoire des Celts, 1. ii. c. 11. Dictionaire

Diplomatique, torn. i. p. 213. We may add, that

the oldest Runic inscriptions are supposed to be of the

third century, and the most ancient writer who men­

tions the Runic characters, is Venantius Fortunatus,

(Carm. vii. 18.) who lived towards the end of the sixth

century.

[21] When the Germans commanded the Ubit

of Cologne to cast off the Roman yoke, and with

their new freedom to resume their ancient manners,

they insisted on the immediate demolition of the

walls of the colony. "Postulamus a vobis, muros

'' coloniæ, muniments servitii detrahatis; etiam

"cuntur." Tacit. Hist. iv. 64.

[22] The straggling villages of Silesia are several

miles in length. See Cluver. 1. i. c. 13.

[23] One hundred and forty years after Tacitus

a few more regular structures were erected near the

Rhine and Danube.

[29] It is said that the Mexicans and Peruvians,

without the use of either money or iron had made

a very great progress in the arts. Those arts, and

the monuments they produced, have been strangely

magnified. See Recherches fur les Americains,
