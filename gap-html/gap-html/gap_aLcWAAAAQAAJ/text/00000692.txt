lxxii NOTES ON THE FIFTEENTH'CHAPTER.

Republican genius of the Swiss and German re­

formers.

[in] See Molheim in the first and second cen­

turies. Ignatius (ad Smyrnæos, c. 3, &c.) is fond

of exalting the episcopal dignity. Le Clerc (Hist.

Ecclesiast. p. 569.) very bluntly censures his con­

duct. Mosheim, with a more critical judgment,

(p. 161.) suspects the purity even of the smaller

epistles.

[112] Nonne et Laici sacerdotes sumus? Ter-

tullian, Exhort, ad Castitat. c. 7. As the human

heart is still the si me, several of the observations

which Mr. Hurr.e has made on Enthusiasm, (Essays,

vol. i. p. 76, quarto edit.) may be applied even to

real inspiration.

[11'] Acta Cor.cil. Carthag. apud Cyprian, Edit.

Fell, p. 15S. This council was composed of eighty-

seven bishops from the provinces of Mauritania, Nu-

midia, and Africa; some presbyters and deacons assist­

ed at the assembly; præsente pit bis maxima pane.

[114] Aguntur præterea per Græcias illas, certis

in locis concilia, &c. Tertullian, de Jejuniis, c,

13. The African mentions it as a recent and so-

reign institution. The coalition of the christian

churches is very ably explained by Molheim, p.

164—170* .

[115] Cyprian, in his admired treatise De Unita-

te Ecclesire, p. 75—86. ,

[116] We may appeal to the whole tenor of Cy­

prian's conduct, of his doctrine, and of his Epistles.

Le Clerc, in a short life of Cyprian (Bibliotheque

Universelle, torn. xii. p. 207—378.), has laid him

open with great freedom and accuracy.

[117] If Novatus, Felicislimus, &c. whom the bi­

shop of Carthage expelled from his church, and

from Africa, were not the moll detestable monsters

of wickedness, the zeal of Cyprian must occasion­

ally have prevailed over his veracity. For a very

just account of these obscure quarrels, fee Mo­

sheim, p. 497—S,z*

Eccles. Disciplin. p. 19, 20.

'[119] Tertullian, in a distinct treatise, has pleaded

against the heretics, the right of prescription, as it

was held by the apostolic churches.

[ 120] The journey of St. Peter to Rome is men­

tioned by most of the ancients, (fee £usebius, ii.

25.) maintained by all the catholics, allowed by

some protestants, (fee Pearson and Dodwell de Suc­

cess. Episcop. Reman.) but has been vigorously

attacked by Spanhcim (Miscellanea Sacra, iii. 3.).

According to father Hardouin, the monks of the

thirteenth century, who composed the Æneid, re­

presented St. Peter under the allegorical character

of the Trojan hero,

[121] It is in French only, that the famous allu­

sion to St. Peter's name is exact. Tu es Pierre et

fur cette fierre.—The fame is imperfect in Greek,

Latin, Italian, &c. and totally unintelligible in our

Teutonic languages.

[122] Ircnæusadv. H-xreses, iii. 3. Tertullian

de Prescription, c. 36, and Cyprian Epillol. 27. 5c.

71. 75. Le Clerc (Hist. Eccles. p. 764.) and Mo-

slieim (p. 258. 578.) labour in the interpretation

os these passages. But the loose and rhetorical style

of the fathers often appears favourable to the pre­

tensions of Rome.

[123] See the sharp epistle from Firmilianus bi­

shop of Cassarea, to Stephen bishop of Rome, ap.

Cyprian, Fpistol. 75.

[124] Concerning this dispute of there-baptism

of heretics; fee the epistles of Cyprian, and the

seventh book of Eusebius.

[125] For the origin of those words, see Mo­

sheim, p. 141. Spanheim, Hist. Ecclesiastic, p.

633. The distinction of Clerus and Laicui wa3

established before the time of Tertullian.

[126] The community instituted by Plato, is

more perfect than that which Sir Thomas More had

imagined for his Utopia, The community of wo­

men, and that of temporal goods, may be consi­

dered as inseparable parts of the fame system.

with Grotius's Commentary. Molheim, in a parti­

cular dissertation, attacks the common opinion with

very inconclusive arguments. . I .
