above eight thousand pounds for three declamations.

See Philostrat. 1. i. p. 558. The Antonines found­

ed a school at Athens, in which professors of gram>-

mar, rhetoric, politics, and the four great sects of

philosophy, were maintained at the public expence

for the instruction of youth. The salary of a philo­

sopher was ten thousand drachmae, between three

and four hundred pounds a year. Similar establish­

ments were formed in the other great cities of the

empire. See Lucian in Eunuch, torn. ii. p. 353.

Toll. Here too wemayYayof Longinus, " his own

example strengthens all his laws." Instead of pro­

posing his sentiments with a manly boldness, he in­

sinuates them with the most guarded caution, puts

them into the mouth of a friend; and as far as we

can collect from a corrupted text, makes a sliew of

refuting them himself.

NOTES ON THE THIRD CHAPTER.

[1] WROS1US, vi. 18.

[2] Julius Cæsar introduced soldiers, strangers

and half-barbarians, into the senate (Sueton, in

Cæsar, c. 77. 80.). The abuse became still more

scandalous after his death.

[3] Dion Cassius, I. Iii. p. 693. Suetonius in

August, c. 55. ,

[4] Dion (1. liii. p. 698) gives as a prolix and

bombast speech on this great occasion. I have bor­

rowed from Suetonius and Tacitus the general lan­

guage of Augustus.

[5] Imperator (from which we have derived em­

peror) signified under the republic no more than

general, and was emphatically bestowed by the

soldiers, when on the field of battle they proclaimed

their victorious leader worthy of that title. Whea

the Roman emperors assumed it in that fense, they

placed it after their name, and marked how often they

had taken it.

[6] Dion, 1. liii, p. 703, &c.

[7] Livy Epitom. 1. xiv. Valer. Maxim, vi. jt

[8] See in the viiith book of Livy, the conduct

of Manlius Torquatus and Papirius Cnrfor. They

violated the laws 6f nature and humanity, but they

asserted those of military discipline; and the people,

who abhorred the action, was obliged to respect the

principle.

[9] By the lavish but unconstrained suffrages of

the people, Pompey had obtained a military com­

mand scarcely inferior to that of Augustas. Among

the extraordinary acts of power executed by the for­

mer, we may remark the foundation of twenty nine

cities, and the distribution of three or four millions

sterling to his troops. The ratification of his acts-

met with some opposition and delays in the senate.

See Plutarch, Appian, Dion CaffiuSj and the first

book of the epistles to Atticus.

[10] Under the commonwealth, a triumph could

only be claimed by the general, who was authorised'

to take the Auspices in the name of the people.

By an exact consequence drawn frpm this principle

of policy and religion, the triumph was reserved

7 to.
