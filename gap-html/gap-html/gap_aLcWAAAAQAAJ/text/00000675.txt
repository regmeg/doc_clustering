NOTES ON THE THIRTEENTH CHAPTER. lv

I will venture to recommend as one of the bell

versions extant.

[67] Hist. Armen. I. ii. c. 76. I have transferred

this exploit of Tiridates from an imaginary defeat

to the real one of Galerius.

[68] Ammian. Marcellin. L xiv. The mile, in

the hands of Eutropiui (ix. 24.)> ofFestus (c. 25.),

and of Orosius (vii. 25 ), easily increased to ftvtral

miles,

[69] Aurelius Victor. Jornandes de rebus Ge-

ticis, c. 21.

[70] Aurelius Victor fays, "Per Armeniam in

hostes contendit, qua: ferme sola, feu facilior vin-

cendi via est." He followed the conduct of Trajan,

and the idea of Julius Cæsar.

[71] Xenophon's Anabasis, 1. iii. For that reason

the Persian cavalry encamped sixty stadia from the

enemy.

[72] The story is told by Ammianus, 1. xxii.

Instead of saccunt some read scutum.

[73] The Persians confessed the Roman superio­

rity in morals as well as in arms. Eutrop. ix. 24.

But this respect and gratitude of enemies is very sel­

dom to be found in their own accounts.

[74] The account of the negociation is taken

from the fragments of Peter the Patrician, in the

Excerpta Legationum published in the Byzantine

Collection. Peter lived under Justinian; but it is very

evident, by the nature of his materials, that they

are drawn from the most authentic and respectable

writers.

[75] Adeo Victor (fays Aurelius) ut ni Valerius,

cujus nutu omnia gerebantur, abnuiflet, Romani

fasces in provinciam novam ferrentur. Verum

pars terrarum tamen nobis utilior quæsita.

[76] He had been governor of Sumium. (Pet,

Patricius in Excerpt. Legat. p. 30.) This province

seems to be mentioned by Moses of Chorene (Geo-

graph. p. 360.), and lay to the East of Mount

Ararat.

(77] By an error of the geographer Ptolemy,

the position of Singara is removed from the Aborts

to the Tigris, which may have produced the mistake

of Peter, in assigning the latter river for the boun­

dary, instead of the former. The line of the Roman

frontier traversed, but never followed, the course of

the Tigris.

[78] Procopius de Edificiis, 1. ii. c. 6.

[79] Three of the provinces, Zabdicene, Ar.

zanene, and Carduene, are allowed on all sides.

But instead of the other two, Peter (in Excerpt.

Leg. p. 30.) inserts Rehimene and Sophcne. I

have preferred Ammianus, (1. xxv. 7.) because it

might be proved, that Sophene was never in the

hands of the Persians, either before the reign of

Diocletian, or after that of Jovian. For want of

correct maps, like those of M. Danville, almost all

the moderns, with Tillemont and Valesius at their

head, have imagined, that it was in respect to

Persia, and not to Rome, that the five provinces

were situate beyond the Tigris.

[80] Xenophon's Anabasis, 1. iv. Their bows

were three cubits in length, their arrows two; they

rolled down stones that were each a waggon load.

The Greeks found a great many villages in that

rude country.

[81] According to Eutropius (vi. 9. as the text

is represented by the best MSS.) the city of Tigra-

nocerta was in Arzanene. The names and situation

of the other three may be faintly traced.

[82] Compare Herodotus, 1. i. c. 97. with Moses

Choronens. Hist. Armen. 1. ii. c. 84. and the map

os Armenia given by his editors.

[83] Hiberi, locorum potentes,Caspia via Sarma-

tam in Armenios raptim efFundunt. Tacit. Annal.

vi. 34. See Strabon. Geograph. 1. xi. p. 7s 4.

[84] Peter Patricius (in Excerpt. Leg. p. 30.) is

the only writer who mentions the Iberian article of

the treaty.

[8c] Eufebius in Chron. Pagi ad annum. Till

the discovery of the treatise De Mortibus Persecu-

torum, it was not certain that the triumph and th«

Vicennalia were celebrated at the fame time.

[86] At the time of the Vicennalia, Galerius

seems to have kept.his station on the Danube. See

Lactant. de M. P. c. 38.

[S7] Eutropius
