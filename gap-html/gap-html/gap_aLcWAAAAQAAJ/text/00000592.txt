THE DECLINE AND FALL

wards the sectaries of the new religion, and his constant reverence

for the ministers of the church, gave some colour to the suspicion,

which prevailed in his own times, that the emperor himself had

become a convert to the faith 1,8; and afforded some grounds for a

fable which was afterwards invented, that he had been purified by

confession and pennance from the stain of guilt, which he had con­

tracted by the murder of his innocent predecessor "9. The fall of

to suppose that the penetration of Decius had discovered pride under

the disguise of humility, or that he could foresee the temporal do­

minion which might insensibly arise from the claims of spiritual

authority, we might be less surprised, that he should consider the

successors of St. Peter as the most formidable rivals to those of Au­
