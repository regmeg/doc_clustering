NOTES ON THE SIXTEENTH CHAPTER.

[186] Plin. Epist. x. 97. Fuerunt alii similrs

amentiæ, cives Romani - — - - Mulri enim

omnis ætatis, omnis ordinii, utriusque sexus, eciarre

vocantur in periculum et vocabuntur.

[187J Tertullian ad Scapulam. Yet even his

rhetoric rises no higher than to claim a tsnth part

of Carthage.

[188] Cyprian. Epist. 79.

[189] Dr. Lardner, in his first and second vo­

lume of Jewish and Christian testimonies, collects

and illustrates those of Pliny the younger, of Tacitus,

of Galen, of Marcus Antoninus, and perhaps of

Epictetus (for it is doubtful whether that philoso­

pher means to speak of the Christians). The new

sect is totally unnoticed by Seneca, the elder Pliny,

and Plutarch.

[190] If the famous prophecy of the Seventy

Weeks had been alleged to a Roman philosopher,

would he not have replied in the words of Ciceroi

"Qu-e tandem ista auguratio est, annorum potius

quam aut mensium aut dierum?" De Divinatione,

ii, 30. Observe with what irreverence Lucian (in

Alexandra, c. 13.), and his friend Celfus ap. Origen,

(I. vii. p. 327.) express themselves concerning the

Hebrew prophets.

[191] The Philosophers, who derided the more

ancient prediiiions of the Sybils, would easily have

detected the Jewish and Christian forgeries, which

have been so triumphantly quoted by the fathers from

Justin Martyr to Lactantius. When the Sibylline

verses had performed their appointed task, they, like

the system of the millennium, were quietly laid aside.

The Christian Sibyl had unluckily fixed the ruin

of Rome for the year 195, A. U. C. 94.8.

[192] The fathers, as they are drawn out in

battle array by Dom Calmet (Dissertations fur

la Bible, torn. Hi. p. 295—308 ), fcem to cover

the whole earth with darkness, in which they are

followed by most of the moderns.

[•93] Origen ad Matth. c. 27. and a few

modern critics, Beza, Le Clare, Lardner, &c. arc,

desirous of confining it to the land of judea.

[194.] The celebrated passage of Phlegon is now

wifely abandoned. When Tertullian assures the,

pagans, that the mention of the prodigy is found in

Arcanis (not Archivis) vestris, (fee his Apology, c.

21.) he probably appeals to the Sibylline verses, which,

relate it exactly in the words of the gospel.

[195] Seneca Quæst. Natur. i. l, 15. vi. |«-

vii. 17. Plin. Hist. Natur. 1. ii.

[196] Plin. Hist. Natur. ii. 30.

[197] Virgil Georgic. c. i. 466. Tibaltus, 1. n,

Eleg. v. p. 75. Ovid. Metamorph. xv. 782. Lucan.

r. 54.0. The last places this prodigy before the

civil war.

[198] See a public epistle of M. Anthony in

Joseph. Antiquit. xiv. iz. Plutarch in Cæsar, p- 74^

Appian, Bell. Civil. 1. iv. Dion Caffius, l.xlv. p.

431. Julius Obiequens, c. 1 28. His little treatise,

is an abstract of Livy's prodigies.

[i]TN Cyrcne they massacred 2zc,odd Greeks;

A in Cyprus, 240,000; in Egypt, a .very

great multitude. Many of these unhappy victims

were sawed asunder, according to a precedent to

which David had given the sanction of his example.

The victorious Jews devoured the flesh, licked up

the blood, and twisted the entrails like a girdle

round their bodies. See Dion Cailius, 1. lxviii.

p. 1145.

[2] Without repeating the well-known narra­

tives of josephus, we may learn from Dion, (1.

TEENTH CHAPT E B...

Ixix. p. 1162.) that in Hadrian's war 580,000 Jews

were cut off by the sword, besides an infinite number

which perished by famine, by disease, and by fire*
