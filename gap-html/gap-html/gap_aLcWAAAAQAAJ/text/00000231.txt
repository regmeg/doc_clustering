OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

a monarch no less powerful than Hadrian or Augustus. The form

was still the fame, but the animating health and vigour were fled.

The industry of the people was discouraged and exhausted by a

long series of oppression. The discipline of the legions, which

alone, after the extinction of every other virtue, had propped the

greatness of the state, was corrupted by the ambition, or relaxed

by the weakness of the emperors. The strength of the frontiers,

which had always consisted in arms rather than in fortifications,

was insensibly undermined; and the fairest provinces were left exÂ­

posed to the rapaciousness or ambition of the barbarians, who sooa

discovered the decline of the Roman power.
