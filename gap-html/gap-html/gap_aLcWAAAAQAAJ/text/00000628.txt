oration of Agrippa, or rather of the historian, is a

fine picture of the Roman empire.

[64] Sueton. in August, c. 28. Augustus built in

Rome the temple and forum of Mars the Avenger:

the temple of Jupiter Tonans in the capitol; that

of Apollo Palatine, with public libraries; the por­

tico and basilica of Caius and Lucius, the porticoes

'of Livia and Octavia. and the theatre of Marcellus.

The example of the sovereign was imitated by

his ministers and generals; and his friend Agrippa

left behind him the immortal monument of the

Pantheon.

[66] See the xth book of Pliny's Epistles. He

mentions the following works, carried on at the

expence of the cities. At Nicomedia, a new forum,

an aqueduct, and a canal, left unfinistied by a King;

at Nice, a Gymnasium, and a theatre which had

already cost near ninety thousand pounds; baths

at Prusa and Claudiopolis; and an aqueduct of

sixteen miles in length for the use of Sinope.

[67] Hadrian afterwards made a very equitable

regulation, which divided all treasure trove be­

tween the right of property and that of discovery,

pains in consulting and comparing modern travel­

lers, with regard to the fate of those eleven cities of

Asia; seven or eight are totally destroyed, Hypæpe,

Tralles, Laodicea, Ilium, HalicarnafTus, Miletus,

Ephefus, and we may add Sardes. Of the remain­

ing three, Pergamus is a straggling village of two

or three thousand inhabitants. Magnesia, under

the name of Guzel hisiar, a town of some conse­

quence; and Smyrna, a great city, peopled by am

hundred thousand souls. But even at Smyrna

while the Franks have maintained commerce, the

Turks have ruined the arts.
