1 NOTES ON THE TWELFTH CHAPTER.

[71] Hist. August, p. 253. Eutropius, ix. 18.

Fagi. Annal.

[7*] Agathias, 1. iv. p. 13?. We find one of his

sayings in the Bibliotheque Orientale of M. d'Her-

bclot. "The definition of humanity includes all

other virtues."

{73] Synesius tells this story of Carinus; and it

is much more natural to understand it of Cams,

than (as Petavius and Tillemont chuse to do) of

Probus.

[74] Vppiscus in Hist. August, p. 250. Eutro­

pius, ix. it. The two Victors.

[75] To the Persian victory of Carus, I refer the

dialogue of the Pbilopatris, which has so long been

an object of dispute among the learned. But to

explain and justify my opinion, would require a

dissertation.

[76] Hist. August, p. 250. Yet Eutropius,

Festus, Ruses, the two Victors, Jerome, Sidonius

jApollinaris, Syncellus, and Zonaras, all ascribe

the death of Carus to lightning.

I77] See Nemefian. Cynegeticon, v. 71, &c.

[78] See Festus and his commentators, on the

word Scribonianum. Places struck with lightning,

were surrounded with a wall: things were buried

with mysterious ceremony.

[79] Vopiseus in Hist. August, p. 250. Aurelius

Victor seems to believe the prediction, and to ap­

prove the retreat.

[80] Nemefian. Cynegeticon, v. 69. He was a

contemporary, but a poet.

[81] Canctllarius. This word, so hnmble in

its origin, has by a singular fortune rose into the

title of the first great office os state in the monarchies

of Europe. See Casaubon and Salmasius, ad Hist.

August. j>. 253.

[82] Vopiscusin Hist. August, p. 253, 254. Eu­

tropius, ix. 19. Victor Junior. The reign of Dio­

cletian indeed was so long and prosperous, that it

must have been very unfavourable to the fame of

Carinus.

[83] Vopiseus in Hist. August, p. 254. He calls

him Cams, but the fense is sufficiently obvious, and

the words were often confounded.

[84] See Calphurnius. Eclog. vii. 43. We

may observe, that the spectacles of Probus were still

recent, and that the poet is seconded by the

historian.

[85] The philosopher Montaigne (E/Tats, I. Hi.

6.) gives a very just and lively view of Roman

magnificence in these spectacles.

[86] Vopiseus in Hist. August, p. 240.

[87] They are called Onagri'■; but the number

is too inconsiderable for mere wild-asses. Cuper

(de Elephantis Exercitat. ii. 7.) has proved from

Oppian, Dion, and an anonymous Greek, that

zebras had been seen at Rome. They were

brought from some island of the ocean, perhaps

Madagascar.

[88] Carinus gave an hippopotamus (see Cal-

phurn. Eclog. vii. 66,). In the later spectacles, £

do not recollect any crocodiles, of which Augustua,

once exhibited thirty-six. Dion Caffius, L lv„

p. 781.

[89] Capitolin. in Hist. August, p. 164, r'c.

We are not acquainted with the animals whom

he calls arckeltoritts, some read argtleontt*,

others agrialeontts: both corrections are very nu­

gatory. ■ .

Piso.

[92] Maffei, 1. ii c. 2. The height was very much,

exaggerated by the ancients. It reached almost to

the heavens, according to Calphurnius, (Eclog,

vii. 23.) and surpassed the ken of human fight,

according to Ammiaaus Marcellinus (xvi. 10).

Yet how trifling to the great pyramid of Egypt,

which rises 500 feet perpendicular.

[93] According to different copies of Victor,

we read 77,000, or 87,000 spectators; but Maffei

(1. ii. c. 12.) finds room on the open feats for no

more than 34,000. The remainder were contained

in the upper covered galleries.

[94] See Maffei, 1. ii. c. 5—12. He treats the

very difficult subject with all possible clearness,

and like an architect, as well as an antiquarian.

[95] Calphurn. Eclog. vii. 64. 73. These

lines are curious, and the whole Eclogue has been

of infinite use to Maffei. Calphurnius, as well as

Martial,
