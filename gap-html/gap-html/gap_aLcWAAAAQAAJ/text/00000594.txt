S6z THE DECLINE AND FALL

travagant acclamations in the praise os his divine eloquence. Against

those who resisted his power, or refused to flatter his vanity, the

prelate of Antioch was arrogant, rigid, and inexorable; but he re­

laxed the discipline, and lavished the treasures of the church on his
