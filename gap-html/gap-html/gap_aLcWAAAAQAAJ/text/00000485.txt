OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

circumcision was enjoined to a single family. When the posterity

of Abraham had multiplied like the sands of the sea, the Deity,

from whose mouth they received a system of laws and ceremonies,

declared himself the proper and as it were the national God of

Israel; and with the most jealous care, separated his favourite peo­

ple from the rest of mankind. The conquest of the land of Canaan

was accompanied with so many wonderful and with so many bloody

circumstances, that the victorious Jews were left in a state of irre­

the law; nor were the Jews inclined to impose it on themselves as

a voluntary duty. In the admission of new citizens, that unsocial

their inheritance, by sharing it too easily with the strangers of the

ledge without correcting their prejudices; and whenever the God of

Israel acquired any new votaries, he was much more indebted to the

inconstant humour of polytheism than to the active zeal of his own

missionaries The religion of Moses seems to be instituted for a

particular country, as well as for a single nation; and if a strict

obedience had been paid to the order, that every male, three times in

the year, should present himself before the Lord Jehovah, it would
