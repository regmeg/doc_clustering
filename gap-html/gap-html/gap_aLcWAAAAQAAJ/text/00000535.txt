OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

the populace, were perhaps the only order of priests,+s who derived

their whole support and credit from their sacerdotal profession*

and who were very deeply affected by a personal concern for the

safety or prosperity of their tutelar deities. The ministers

of polytheism, both in Rome and in the principal provinces,
