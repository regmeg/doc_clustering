THE DECLINE AND FALL

nor did Severus claim the arrogant superiority of suffering his

rivals to live in a private station. But his unforgiving temper*

stimulated by avarice, indulged a spirit of revenge, where there

was no room for apprehension. The most considerable of the pro­

vincials, who, without any dislike to the fortunate candidate, had

obeyed the governor, under whose authority they were accidentally

placed, were punished by death, exile, and especially by the con­

fiscation of their estates. Many cities of the east were stript of their

ancient honours, and obliged to pay, into the treasury of Severus,

four times the amount of the sums contributed by them for the ser­

vice of Niger S*.

Till the final decision of the war, the cruelty of Severus was, in

some measure, restrained by the uncertainty of the event, and his

pretended reverence for the senate. The head of Albinus, accom­

panied with a menacing letter, announced to the Romans, that he

was resolved to spare none of the adherents of his unfortunate com­

petitors. He was irritated by the just suspicion, that he had never

possessed the affections of the senate, and he concealed his old male­

volence under the recent discovery of some treasonable correspond­

ences. Thirty-five senators, however, accused of having favoured

the party of Albinus, he freely pardoned; and by his subsequent

behaviour, endeavoured to convince them, that he had forgotten*

as well as forgiven, their supposed offences. But, at the fame time,

he condemned forty-one 57 other senators, whose names history has

recorded; their wives, children, and clients, attended them in

death, and the noblest provincials of Spain and Gaul were in­

volved in the fame ruin. Such rigid justice, for so he termed it,

was, in the opinion of Severus, the only conduct capable of ensur­

ing peace to the people, or stability to the prince; and he con­

descended slightly to lament, that, to be mild, it was necessary that

he should first be cruel s%
