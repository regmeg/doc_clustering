NOTES ON THE ELEVENTH CHAPTER.

[23] The Walachians still preserve many traces

of the Latin language, and have boasted in every

age of the Roman descent. They are surrounded

by, but not mixed with, the barbarians. See a

Memoire of M. Danville on ancient Dacia, in the

Academy of Inscriptions, torn. xxx.

[24] See the first chapter of Jornandes. The

Vandals however {c. 22.) maintained a short in­

dependence between the rivers Marisia and Crislia

(Maros and Keres) which fell into the Teiss.

[25] Dexippus, p. 7—12. Zosimus, I. i. g. 43.

Vopiscus in Aurelian in Hist. August. However

these historians differ innames (Alemanni, Juthungi,

and Marcomanni) it is evident that they mean the

fame people, and the fame war, but it requires some

care to conciliate and explain them.

[26] Cantoclarus, with his usual accuracy,

chuses to translate three hundred thousand; his

version is equally repugnant to fense and to gram­

mar.

[27] We may remark, as an instance of bad taste,

that Dexippus applies to the light infantry of the

Alemanni the technical terms proper only to the

Grecian Phalanx.

[28] In Dexippus. we at present read Khodanus,

M. da Valois very judicioufly alters the word to

Eridanus.

[29] The emperor Claudius was certainly of the

number; but we are ignorant how far this mark of

respect was extended; if to Cæsar and Augustus, it

must have produced a very awful spectacle; a long

line of the masters of the world.

[31] Dexippus gives them a subtle and prolix

oration, worthy of a Grecian Sophist.

[36] The little river or rather torrent of Me-

taurus, near Fano, has been immortalized, by

finding such an historian as Livy, and such a poet

as Horace.

[37] It is recorded by an inscription sound at

Pczaro. See Gruter. cclxxvi. 3.

[38] One should imagine, he said, that you

were assembled in a Christian church, not in the

temple of all the gods.

[39] Vopiscus in Hist. Aug. p. 215, 216. gives a

long account of these ceremonies, from the Registers

of the Senate.

[40] Plin. Hist. Natur. iii. 5. To confirm our

idea, we may observe, that for a long time Mount

Cælius was a grove of oaks, and Mount Viminal was

over-run with osiers; that, in the fourth century,

the Aventine was a vacant and solitary retirement,

that till the time of Augustus, the Efquiline was

an unwholesome burying ground; and that the

numerous inequalities, remarked by the ancients in

the Quirinal, sufficiently prove that it was not

covered with, buildings. Gf the seven hills, the

Capitoline and Palatine only, with the adjacent

vallics, were the primitive habitation of the Roman

people. But thk sobject would require a disser­

tation.

[4>] Exspatiantia tecta multas addidere urbes,

is the expression of Plinyi

[42] Hist. August, p. 22)2. Both Lipsius and

Isaac Vofiius have eagerly embraced this measure.

[46] His competitor was Lollianus, or Ælianus,

if indeed these names mean the fame person. See

Tillemont, torn. iii. p. 1177.

[47] The character of this prince by Julius Ate-

rianus (ap. Hist. August, p. 187.) is worth transcrib­

ing, as it seems fair and impartial. Victorino qoi
