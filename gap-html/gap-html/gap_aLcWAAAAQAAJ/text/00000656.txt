NOTES ON THE TENTH CHAPTER.

It is seldom that the antiquarian and the philoso­

pher are so happily blended.

[87] Should we suspect that Athens contained

only 21,000 citizens, and Sparta no more than

39,000? See Hume and Wallace on the number

of mankind in ancient and modern times.

NOTES ON THE

[1] 'TT'HE expjeffion used by Zosimus and

X Zonaras may signify that Marinus com­

manded a century, a cohort, or a legion.

[a] His birth at Bubalia, a little village in

Pannonia (Eutrop. ix. Victor, in Cæsarib. et

Epitom.) seems to contradict, unless it was merely

.accidental, his supposed descent from the Decii.

Six hundred years had bellowed nobility on the

Decii ; but at the commencement of that period,

they were only Plebeians of merit, and among the

first who shared the consulship with the haughty

Patricians. Plebeix Deciorum animæ, &c. Ju­

venal, Sat. viii. 254. See the spirited speech

of Decius in Livy, x. 9, 10.

[4] See the prefaces of Cassiodorus and Jor­

nandes: it is surprising that the latter should be

omitted in the excellent edition published by GrO-

tius, of the Gothic writers.

by Ingo king of Sweden, who began his reign in

the year 1075, a°d about fourscore years after­

wards a Christian Cathedral was erected on its

ruins. See Dalin's History of Sweden in the

Bibliotheque Raisonnee.

[11] Mallet, c. iv. p. 55, has collected from

Strabo, Pliny, Ptolemy, and Stephanos Byzan-

tinus, the vestiges of such a city and people.

[12] This wonderful expedition of Odin, which,

by deducing the enmity of the Gotbs and Romans

from so memorable a cause, might supply the noble

ground-work of an Epic Poem, cannot safely be

received as authentic history. According to the

obvious sense of the Edda, and the interpretation

of the most skilful critics, As-gard, instead of de­

noting a real city of the Asiatic Sarmatia, is the

fictitious appellation of the m\stic abode of the

gods, the Olympus of Scandinavia; from whence

the prophet was supposed to descend, when he an­

nounced his new religion to the Gothic nations,

who were already seated in the southern parts of

Sweden.
