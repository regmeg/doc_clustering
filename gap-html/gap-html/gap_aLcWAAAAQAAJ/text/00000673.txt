Appian in Proxm.

[z8] As a great number of medals of Caraufius

are still preserved, he is become a very favourite

object of antiquarian curiosity, and every circum­

stance of his life and actions has been investigated

with sagacious accuracy. Dr. Stulcely in particular

ha's devoted a large volume to the British Emperor.

I have used his materials, and rejected most of his

fanciful conjectures.

[29] When Mamertinus pronounced his first

panegyric, the naval preparations of Maximian were

completed: and the orator presaged an assured

victory. His silence in the second Panegyric, might

alone inform us, that the expedition had not suc­

ceeded.

[30] Aurelius Victor, Eutrppius, and the medals

(Pax Auggg.) inform us of this temporary reconci­

liation: though 1 will not presume (as Dr. Stukely

has done, Metallic History of Caraufius, p. 86, &c.)

to insert the identical articles of the treaty.

[31] With regard to the recovery of Britain,

we ob:ain a few hints from Aurelius Victor and

Eutropius.

p. 408, 409.

[33J Zosimus, 1. i. p. 3. That partial historian

seems to cekbra:e the vigilance of Diocletian,

with the design of exposing the negligence of

Constantine; we may, however, listen to an ora­

tor, " Nam quid ego alarum et cohortium castra

percenseam, toto Rheni et Istri et Euphratis limite

restituta, Panegyr. Vet. iv. 18.

[34] Ruunt omnes in sanguinem suum populi,

quibus nca contigit esse Romanis, obstinatacque

feritatis pœnas nunc sponte persolvunt. Panegyr.

Vet. iii. 16. Mamertinus illustrates the fact, by

the example of alinost all the nations of the world.

[33] He complained, though not with the strict,

est. truth; " Jam fluxisse annos quindecim in qui.

bus, in Ulyrico, ad ripam Danubii relegatus cum

gentibus barbaris luctaret-" Lactant. de M. P.

C. 18.

[36] In the Greek text of Eusebius, we read six

thousand, a number which I have preferred to the

sixty thousand os Jerome, Crosius, Eutropius, ar.d

his Greek translator Pæanius.

[37] Panegyr. Vet. vii. zi.

[38] There was a settlement of the Sarmatians la

the neighbourhood of Treves, which seems to haver

been deserted by those lazy Barbarians: Aufoniui

speaks of them in his Moselle.

Unde iter ingrediens nemorosa per avia solum,

Et nulla humani spectans vestigia cultus

Arvaque Sauromatum nuper me tata colonis.

There was a town of the Carpiin the Lower Mæsia-

[39] See the rhetorical exultation of Eumenius.

[40] Scaliger (Animadverf. ad Euscb. p. 243.)

decides in his usual manner, that the Quinque

gentiani, or five African nations, were the five great

cities, the Pentapolis of the inoffensive province

of Cyrene.

[41] After his defeat, Julian stabbed himself

with a dagger, and immediately leaped into the

flames. Victor in Epitome.

[42] Tu ferocisiimos Mauritania; populos in access s

montium jugis et naturali munitione fidentes, ex-

pugnasti, recepisti, transtulisti. Panegyr. Vet. vi, 8.

Eumenius assures us, that Egypt was pacified by the

clemency of Diocletian.

[45] Eusebius (in Chron.) places their destruction,

several years sooner, and at a time when Egypt it­

self was in a state of rebellion against the Romans.
