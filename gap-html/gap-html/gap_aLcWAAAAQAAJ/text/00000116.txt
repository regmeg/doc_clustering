THE DECLINE AND FALL

and the apprehension of his enemies. The object of his displeasure,

after his exile or escape from the narrow limits of his dominions,

would easily obtain, in a happier climate, a secure refuge, a new

fortune adequate to his merit, the freedom of complaint, and perhaps

the means of revenge. But the empire of the Romans filled the

world, and when that empire fell into the hands of a single person,

the world became a secure and dreary prison for his enemies. The

slave of Imperial despotism, whether he was condemned to drag his

gilded chain in Rome and the senate, or to wear out a life of exile

on the barren rock of Seriphus, or the frozen banks of the Danube,

expected his fate in silent despair 5". To resist was fatal, and it

was impossible to fly. On every side he was encompassed with a

vast extent of sea and land, which he could never hope to traverse

without being discovered, seized, and restored to his irritated

master. Beyond the frontiers, his anxious view could discover no­

thing, except the ocean, inhospitable deserts, hostile tribes of bar­

barians, of fierce manners and unknown language, or dependent

kings, who would gladly purchase the emperor's protection by the

sacrifice of an obnoxious fugitiveS9. "Wherever you are," said

Gicero to the exiled Marcellus, " remember that you are equally

«« within the power of our conqueror6o."
