[;8j Apuleius and Augustin will answer for

Africa; Strabo for Spain and Gaul; Tacitus, in

the life of Agric: la, for Britain; and Velleius Pa-

terculus, for Pannonia. To them we may add the

language of the Inscriptions.

[39] The Celtic was preserved in the mountains

of Wale , Cornwall, and Armorica. We may ob­

serve that Apuleius reproaches an African youth,

who lived among the vilest of the populace, with

the use of the Punic; whilst he had almost forgot

Greek, and neither could nor would speak Latin

(Apolog. p. 596.). The greater part of St. Austin's

congregations were strangers to the Punic.

[40] Spain alone produced Columella, the Sene-

cas, Lucan, Martial, and Quintilian.

[41] There is not, I believe, from Dionysius to

Libanius, a single Greek critic who mentions Virgil

or Horace. 1'hey seem ignorant that the Romans

had any good writers.

[42] The curious reader may fee in Dupin (Bi-

bliotheque Kcclesiastique, torn. xix. p. i.e. 8.) how

much the use of the Syriac and Egyptian languages

was still preserved.

[43] See Juvenal, Sat. iii. and xv. Ammian.

Marcellin. xxii. 16.

[44] Dion Cassius, 1. Ixxvii. p. 1275. The first

instance happened under the reign of Septimius

Severus.

[45] See Valerius Maximus, 1. ii. C< 2. n. 2.

The emperor Claudius disfranchised an eminent

Grecian for not understanding Latin. He was

probably in some public office. Suetonius in Claud,

c. 16.

[46] In the camp of, Lucullus, an ox fold for a

drachma, and a slave for four drachma-, or about

three (hillings. Plutarch, in Lucull. p. 580.

and xxxvi. Florus, iii. 19, 2c.

[48] See a remarkable instance of severity, in

Cicero in Verrem, v. 3.

[49] See in Gruter, and the other collectors, a

great number of inscriptions addressed by staves to

their wives, children, fellow-servants, mailers, &c.

They are all most probably of the Imperial age.

[<,o] See the Augu.lan History, and a Disserta­

tion of M. de Burigny, in the xxxvth volume of the

Academy of Inscriptions, upon the Roman staves.

in the xxxviith volume, on the Roman freedmen.

p 124, &c,

[55] Seneca de Clementia, I. i. c. 24. The

original is much stronger, " Quantum periculum

immineret si servi nostri numerare nos cospissent."

[54] See Pliny (Hist. Natur. 1. xxxiii.) and Athe-

næus (Deipnosophist. 1. vi. p. 272). The latter

boldly asserts, that he knew very many (irapTrov*,)

Romans who possessed, not for use, but ostentation,

ten and even twenty thousand slaves.

[55] In Paris there are not more than 43,700 do­

mestics of every sort, not a twelfth part of the in­

habitants. Messange Rccherches fur la Population,

p. 186.

[56] A learned slave fold for many hundred

pounds sterling; Atticus always bred and taught

them himself, Cornel, fsepos in Vit. C 13.

[57] Many of the Roman physicians were slaves*

See Dr. Middleton's Dissertation and Defence.

[58] Their ranks and offices are very copiously

enumerated by 1 ignorius de Servis.

executed for not preventing their master's murder.
