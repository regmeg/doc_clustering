NOTES ON THE FIRST CHAPTER.

[37] Vegetius, I. ii. and the rest of his first

book.

[38] The Pyrrhic Dance is extremely well illus­

trated by M. le Beau, in the Academie des Inscrip­

tions, torn. xxxv. p. 262, &c. That learned aca­

demician, in a series of memoirs, has collected all

the passages of the ancients that relate to the Ro­

man legion.

[30] Joseph, de Bell. Judaico, 1. Hi. c. 5. We

are indebted to this Jew for some very curious de­

tails of Roman discipline.

[40] Plin. Panegyr. c. 13. Life of Hadrian, in

the Augustan history.

[41] See an admirable digression on the Ro­

man discipline, in the sixth book of his history.

[42] Vegetius de Re Militari, 1. ii. c. 4, Sec.

considerable part of his very perplexed abridgment,

was taken from the regulations of Trajan and Ha­

drian; and the legion, as he describes it, cannot

suit any other age os the Roman empire.

[43] Vegetius de Re Militari, 1. ii. c. t. In the

purer age of Cæsar and Cicero, the word milts

was almost confined to the infantry. Under the

lower empire, and in the times of chivalry, it was

appropriated almost as exclusively to the men at

arms, who fought on horseback.

[44] In the time of Polybius and Dionylius of

Halicarnassus, (I. v. c. 4$.) the steel point of the

pilum seems to have been much longer. In the

time of Vegetius, it was reduced to a foot, or even

nine inches. I have chosen a medium.

[4;] For the legionary arms. See Lipfius de

Militia Romana, 1. iii. c. 2—7.

[46] See the beautiful comparison of Virgil,

Georgic. ii. v. 279.

[47] M. Guichardt, Memoires Militaircs, torn. i.

c. 4. and Nouveaux Memoires, torn. i. p. 293—

311, has treated the subject like a scholar and an

officer.

[48] °ee Arrian's Tactics. With the true par­

tiality of a Greek, Arrian rather chose to describe

the phalanx of which he had read, than the legions

which he had commanded.

[49] Polyb. 1. xrii.

[50] Veget. de Re Militari, I. ii. c. 6. His

positive testimony, which might be supported by

circumstantial evidence, ought surely to silence

those critics who refuse the Imperial legion its

proper body of cavalry.

[51] See Livy almost throughout, particularly

xlii. 61. .

[52] Plin. Hist. Natur. xxxiii. 2. The true

fense of that very curious passage was first discovered

and illustrated by M. de Beaufort, Republique

Romaine, 1. ii. c. 2.

[53] As in the instance of Horace and Agricola.

This appears to have been a defect in the Roman

discipline; which Hadrian endeavoured to remeJy,

by ascertaining the legal age of a tribune.

[54] See Arrian's Tactics.

[5$] Such, in particular, was the state of the

Batavians. Tacit. Germania, c. 29.

[5' ] Marcus Antoninus obliged the vanquistied

Quadi and Marcomanni to supply him with a latge

body of troops, which he immediately sent into

Britain. Dion Caffius, 1. Ixxi.

[57] Tacit. Annal. Iv. c. Those who fix a

regular proportion of as many foot, and twice at

many horse, confound the auxiliaries of the em­

perors, with the Italian allies of the republic.

[58] Vegetius, ii. 2. Arrian, in his order of

march and battle against the Alani.

[59] The subject of the ancient machines is

treated with great knowledge and ingenuity by the

Chevalier Folard (Polybe, torn. ii. p. 233—290).

He prefers them in many respects to our modern

cannon and mortars. We may observe, that the

use of them in the field gradually became more

prevalent, in proportion as personal valour and

military skill declined with the Roman empire.

When men were ro longer found, their place was

supplied by machines. See Vegetius, ii. 2;. Ar­

rian.

[60] Vegetius finishes his second book, snd the

description of the legion, with the following em­

phatic words, "Universe qua; in queque belli

"genere
