500—525.) whohas weighed the several reasons and

difficulties with his scrupulous accuracy.

[7] In an oration delivered before him, (Pa-

negyr. Vet. ii. 8.) Mamertinus expresses a doubt

whether his hero, in imitating the conduct of

Hannibal and Scipio, had ever heard of their names.

From thence we may fairly infer, that Maximian

was more desirous of being considered as a soldier,

than as a man of letters: and it is in this manner

that we can often translate the language of flattery

into that of truth.

As among the Panegyrics, we find orations pro­

nounced in praise of Maximian, and others which

flatter his adversaries at his expence, we derive

some knowledge from the contrast.

cularly iii. 3. 10. 14. but it would be tedious to

copy the diffuse and affected expressions of their

false eloquence. With regard to the titles, consult

[11] It is only among the modern Greeks that

Tillemont can discover his appellation of Chlorus.

Any remarkable degree of paleness seems incon­

sistent with the rubar mentioned in Panegyric,

v. 19.

[12] Julian, the grandson of Constantius, boasts

that his family was derived from the warlike

Mæsians. Misopogon, p. 34.8. The Dardanians

dwelt on the edge of Mæsia.

[13] Galerius married Valeria, the daughter of

Diocletian; if we speak with strictness, Theodora;

the wife of Constantius, was daughter only to the

wife of Maximian. Spanheim Dissertat. xi. 2.

[14] This division agrees with that of the four

prefectures; yet there is some reason to doubt whe­

ther Spain was not a province of Maximian. See

Tillemont, torn. iv. p. 517.

[24] Aurelius Victor calls them Germans. Eu­

tropius (ix. 2 1.) gives them the name of Saxons.

But Eutropius lived in the ensuing century, and-

seems to use the language os his time.

[25] The three expressions of Eutropius, Aurelius

Victor, and Eumenius, " vilissime natus," "Bata-

viæ alumnus," and "Menapiæ civis," give us a

very doubtful account of the birth of Carausius. Dr.

Stukely, however, (Hist, of Carausius, p. 62 ) chuses

to make him a native of St.. David's, and a prince

of the blood royal of Britain. The former idea he

had found in Richard of Cirencester, p. 44.
