NOTES ON THE T

[iJTTOPISCUS in Hist. August, p. 222.

V Aurelius Victor mentions a formal de­

putation from the troops to the senate.

[2] Vopiscus, our principal authority, wrote

at Rome, sixteen years only after the death of Au-

relian; and besides the recent notoriety of the facts,

constantly draws his materials from the Journals of

the Senate, and the original papers of the Ulpian

library. Zosimus and Zonaras appear as ignorant

of this transaction- a* they were ia general of the

Roman constitution.

[j] Liv. i. 17. Dionys. Halicarn. 1. ii. p. 115.

Plutarch in Numa, p. 60. The first of these writers

relates the story like an orator, the second like a

lawyer, and the third like a moralist, and none of

them probably without some intermixture of sable.

[4] Vopiscus (in Hist. August, p. 227.) calls him

'primæ sententi e consuLu is;' and soon afterwards,

frinapsfinatus. It is natural to suppose, that the

monarchs of Rome, disdaining that humble title,

resigned it to the most ancient of the senators.

[5] The only objection to this genealogy, is that

the historian was named Cornelius, the emperor,

Claudius. But under the lower empire, surnames

were extremely various and uncertain.

[6] Zonaras, 1. xii. p. 637. The Alexandrian

Chronicle, by an obvious mistake, transfers that

age to Aurelian.

[7] In the year 273, he was ordinary consul.

But he must have been SufFectus many years before,

and most probably under Valerian.

[8] Bit millies oBingcntitt. Vopiscus in Hist.

August, p. 229. This sum, according to the old

standard, was equivalent to eight hundred and forty

thousand Roman pounds of silver, each of the value

of three pounds sterling. But in the age of Tacitus,

the coin had lost much of its weight and purity.

[9] After his accession, he gave orders that ten

copies of the historian should be annually transcrib­

ed and placed in the public libraries. The Roman

libraries have long since perished, and tho most

valuable part of Tacitus was preserved in a single

MS. and discovered in a monastery of Westphalia.

[n] Hist. August, p. 228. Tacitus addressed the

Prætorians by the appellation of sandijjimi milites,

and the people by that ofsacratijjimi S^irites.

[12] In his manumissions he never exceeded the

number of an hundred, as limited by the Caninian

law, which was enacted under Augustus, and at

length repealed by Justinian. See Casaubon ad locum

Vopisci.

[13] See the lives of Tacitus, Florianus, and

Probus, in the Augustan History; we may be well

assured, that whatever the soldier gave, the senator

had already given.

[14] Vopiscus in Hist. August, p. 216. Thepas-

sage is perfectly clear; yet both Casaubon and Sal-

masius wish to correct it.

The senators celebrated the happy restoration with-

hecatombs and public rejoicings.

l.i. p. 57. Zonaras, l.xii. p. 637. Two passages

in the life of Probus (p. 236. 238.) convince me,

that these. Scythian invaders of Pontus were Alani.

IT we may believe Zosimus (I. i. p. ;8.) Florianus

pursued them as far as the Cimmerian Bosphorus;

But he had scarcely time for so long and difficult an

expedition.

[18] Eutropius and Aurelius Victor only fay that

he died; Victor junior adds, that it was of a

fever. Zosimus and Zonaras affirm, that he was

killed by the soldiers. Vopiscus mentions both ac­

counts, and seems to hesitate. Yet surely these

jarring opinions are easily reconciled.

[19] According to the two Victors, he reigned

exactly two hundred days.
