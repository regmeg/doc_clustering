THE DECLINE AND FALL

had a wife still alive, but divorce was permitted by the Roman law,

and the fierce passions of the tyrant demanded an immediate gra足

tification. The answer of Valeria was such as became the daughter

and widow of emperors; but it was tempered by the prudence

which her defenceless condition compelled her to observe. She re足

presented to the persons whom Maximin had employed on this

occasion, <c that even if honour could permit a woman of her

character and dignity to entertain a thought of second nuptials,

"decency at least must forbid her to listen to his addresses at a

'* time when the ashes of her husband and his benefactor were

"still warm; and while the sorrows of her mind were still expressed

** by her mourning garments. She ventured to declare, that she  
"could place very little confidence in the professions of a man,

*' whose cruel inconstancy was capable of repudiating a faithful  
"and affectionate wife 8*". On this repulse, the love of Maximin

was converted into fury, and, as witnesses and judges were always

at his disposal, it was easy for him to cover his fury with an

appearance of legal proceedings, and to persecute the reputation as

well as the happiness of Valeria. Her estates were confiscated, her

eunuchs and domestics devoted to the most inhuman tortures, and

several innocent and respectable matrons, who were honoured with

her friendship, suffered death on a false accusation of adultery.

The empress herself, together with her mother Prisca, was con足

demned to exile, and as they were ignominiousty hurried from

place to place before they were confined to a sequestered village in the

deserts of Syria, they exposed their shame and distress to the provinces o^

the East, which, during thirty years, had respected their august dignity.

Diocletian made several ineffectual efforts to alleviate the misfortunes

of his daughter; and, as the last return that he expected for the

imperial purple, which he had conferred upon Maximin, he en足

treated that Valeria might be permitted to share his retirement of
