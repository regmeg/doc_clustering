Though the camel is a heavy beast of burden, we

may learn from Buffbn and Shaw, that the dromedary

is fwifeer than the fleetest-horse.

As an instance of luxury, it is remarked, that he

had glass windows. He was remarkable for his

strength and appetite, courage and dexterity. From

the letter of Aurelian, we may justly infer, that

Firmus was the last of the rebels, and consequently

that Tetricus was already suppressed.

[77] See the triumph of Aurelian, described by

Vopiscus. He relates the particulars, with his

usual minuteness; and on this occasion, (tie) happen

to be interesting. Hist. August. 220.

[78] Among barbarous nations, women have

often combated by the side of their husbands. But

it is almost impossible, that a society of Amazons

should ever have existed either in the old or new

world.

[79] The use of Braces, breeches, or trowscrs,

was still considered in Italy as a Gallic and Barba­

rian fashion. The Romans, however, had made

great advances towards it. To encircle the legs and

thighs with fa/ciæ, or bands, was understood in

the time of Pompey and Horace, to be a proof

of ill-health or effeminacy. Jn the age of Trajan,

the custom was confined to the rich and luxurious.

It gradually was adopted by the meanest of the

people. See a very curious note of Cafaubon, ad

Sucton. in August, c. 82.

[80] Most probably the former; the latter, seen

on the medals of Aurelian, only denote according

to the learned Cardinal Noris) an oriental victory.

[81] The expression of Calphurnius (Eclog. i.

50) Nullos ducet capti<va triumphos, as applied to

Rome, contains a very manifest allusion and cen­

sure.

and of the Sun, which he had brought from Pal­

myra. It was dedicated in the fourth year of his

reign (Euseb. in Chron.) but was most assuredly

begun immediately on his accession.

[86] See in the Augustan History, p. tio, the

omens of his fortune. His devotion to the fun ap­

pears in his letters, on his medals, and is mentioned

in the Cæsars of Julian, Commentaire de Span-

heim, p. 10;.

[94] According to the younger Victor, he some­

times wore the diadem. Dtut and Deminui appear

on his medals.
