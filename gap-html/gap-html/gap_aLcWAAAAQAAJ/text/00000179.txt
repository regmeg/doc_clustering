OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

nianus was involved in the fame fate. As soon as the stubborn

Prætorians could be convinced that they fought for a prince who had

basely deserted them, they surrendered to the conqueror; the con­

tending parties of the Roman army mingling tears of joy and ten­

derness, united under the banners of the imagined son of Caracalla,

and the East acknowledged with pleasure the first emperor of Asiatic

extraction. - •..,<;».■,..; v

The letters of Macrinus had condescended to inform the senate of the Eiagab»i

flight disturbance occasioned by an impostor in Syria, and a decree senate,

immediately passed declaring the rebel and his family public enemies;

with a promise of pardon however to such of his deluded adherents

as should merit it by an immediate return to their duty. During the

twenty days that elapsed from $ie declaration to the victory of Anto­

ninus (for in so short an interval was the fate of the Roman World

decided), the capital and the provinces, more especially those of the

East, were distracted with hopes and fears, agitated with tumult,

and stained with a useless effusion of civil blood, since whosoever

of the rivals prevailed in Syria, must reign wer the empire. The

specious letters in which the young conqueror announced his victory

to the obedient senate, were filled with professions of virtue and

moderation; the shining examples of Marcus and Augustus, he

should ever consider as the great rule of his administration?

and he affected to dwell with pride on the striking resemblance

of his own age and fortunes with those of Augustus, who in

the earliest youth had revenged by a successful war the murder of his

father. By adopting the style of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, son

of Antoninus and grandson of Severus, he tacitly asserted his here­

ditary claim to empire; but by assuming the tribunitian and pro­

consular powers before they had been conferred on him by a decree

of the senate, he offended the delicacy of Roman prejudice. This

new and injudicious violation of the constitution, was probably dic­

tated either by the ignorance of his Syrian courtiers, or the fierce

disdain of his military followersJ0.
