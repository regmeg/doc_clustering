[19] Trajan's sentiments are represented in a very

just and lively manner in the Cæsars of Julian.

[26] See the Augustan History and the Epitomes.

[27] We must, however, remember, that, in the

time of Hadrian, a rebellion of the Jews raged with

religious fury, though only in a single province:

Pausanhs (1. viii, c. 43.) mentions two necessary

and successful wars, conducted by the generals of

Pius. 1st, Against the wandering Moors, who were

driven into the solitudes of Atlas. 2d, Against

the Brigantrs of Britain, who had invaded the

Roman province, Both these wars (with several

other hostilities) are mentioned in the Augustan

[29] Dion, 1. Ixxi. Hist. August, in Mar­

co. The Parthian victories gave birth to a

crowd of contemptible historians, whose memory

has been rescued from oblivion, and exposed to ri­

dicule, in a very lively piece of criticism of Lucian.

[30] The poorest rank of soldiers possessed above

forty pounds sterling, (Dionyf Halicarn. iv. 17.)

a very high qualification, at a time when money

was so scarce, that an ounce of silver was equivalent

to seventy pound weight of brass. The populace,

excluded by the ancient constitution, were indiscri­

minately admitted by Marius. See Sallust. de Bell.

Jugurth. c. 91.

[31] Cæsar formed his legion Alauda, of Gauls

and strangers: but it was during the licence of

civil war; and after the victory he gave them the

freedom of the city, for their reward.

[33] The oath of service and fidelity to the

and with the other deities received the religious

worlhip of the troops.

p. 120, Sec. The emperor Domitian raised the

annual stipend of the legionaries, to twelve pieces of

gold, which, in his time, was equivalent to abou:

ten of our guineas. This pay, somewhat higher

than our own, had been, and was afterwards gra­

dually increased, according to the progress of

wealth and military government. After twenty

years service, the veteran received three thousand

denarii (about one hundred pounds sterling), or a

proportionable allowance of land. The pay and

advantages of the guard were, in general, about

double those of the legions.

[36] Exercitus ab Exercitande, Varo de Lingua

Latina, 1. iv. Cicero in Tuscuian. 1. ii. 37. There is
