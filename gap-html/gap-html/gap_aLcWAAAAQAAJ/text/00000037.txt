OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

small distance beyond the modern cities of Edinburgh and Glas­

gow, was fixed as the limit of the Roman province. The native

Caledonians preserved in the northern extremity of the island their

wild independence, for which they were not less indebted to their

poverty than to their valour. Their incursions were frequently re­
