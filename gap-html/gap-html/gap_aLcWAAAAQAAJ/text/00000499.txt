OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

their reason had been often guided by their imagination, and that their

imagination had been prompted by their vanity. When they

viewed with complacency the extent of their own mental powers,

when they exercised the various faculties of memory, of fancy,

and of judgment, in the most profound speculations, or the most

important labours, and when they reflected on the desire of fame,

which transported them into future ages, far beyond the bounds

of death and of the grave; they were unwilling to confound them­

for whose dignity they entertained the most sincere admiration,

could be limited to a spot of earth, and to a few years of duration.

With this favourable prepossession they summoned to their aid the

virtue and happiness after the release from its corporeal prison.

From these specious and noble principles, the philosophers who

vades and sustains the universe 51. A doctrine thus removed

beyond the fenses and the experience of mankind, might serve to

amuse the leisure of a philosophic mind; or, in the silence of soli­

virtue; but the faint impression which had been received in the

schools, was soon obliterated by the commerce and business of

active life. We are sufficiently acquainted with the eminent per­

sons who flouriihed in the age of Cicero, and of the first Cæsars,

with their actions, their characters, and their motives, to be assured
