[76] M. de Brequigny (in the Memoires de

PAcad'emie, torn. Xxx.) has given us a very curious

life of Posthumus. A series of the Augustan History

from Medals and Inscriptions hat been more than

once planned, and is still ranch wanted.

[77] Aurel. Victor, c. 33. Instead of Pane

direfto, both the fense and the expression require

deltto, though indeed, for different reasons, it is

alike difficult to correct the text of the best and of

the worst writers.

[78^ In the time of Ansonius (the end of the

fourth century) Ilerda or Lerida was in a very

ruinous state, (Auson. Episi. xxv. 58.) which pro­

bably was the consequence of this invasion.

[79] Valesius is therefore mistaken in supposing

that the Franks had invaded Spain by sea.

by Asinius Quadratus, an original historian, quoted

by Agathiasi i. c. 5.

[87] The Suevi engaged Csesar in this manner,

and the manœuvre deserved the approbation of the

conqueror (in Bello Gallico, i. 48.).
