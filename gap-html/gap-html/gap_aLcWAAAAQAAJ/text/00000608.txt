.£?<5 THE DECLINE AND FALL

The provinces of Gaul (under which we may probably include those

of Britain) were indebted for the singular tranquillity which they

•enjoyed, to the gentle interposition of their sovereign ,6\ Bat

Datianus, the president or governor of Spain, actuated either by

Zeal or policy, chose rather to execute the public edicts of the emperors

than to understand the secret intentions of Constantius; and it can

in Italy and The provinces of Italy and Africa experienced a short but vio-

Maximun l?nt persecution. The rigorous edicts of Diocletian were strictly

and cheerfully executed by his associate Maximian, who had long

hated the Christians, and who delighted in acts of blood and

violence. 1st the autumn of the first year of the persecution, the

two'emperors met at Rome to celebrate their triumph; several

pppressive.laws appear to have issued.from their secret consultations,

and the diligence of the magistrates'was animated by the presence

of their sovereigns. After Diocletian had divested himself of the
