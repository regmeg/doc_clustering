NOTES ON THE THIRTEENTH CHAPTER, H

Martial, (see his first book) was a poet, but when

they described the amphitheatre, they both wrote

from their own senses, and to those of the Romans.

[98] Et Martis vultus et Apollinis esse putavi,

fays Calphurnius; but John Malela, who had per­

haps seen pictures of Carinus, describes him as

thick, ihort, and white, torn. i. p. 403.

[99] With regard to the time when these Roman

games were celebrated, Scaliger, Salmasius, and

Cuper, have given themselves a great deal of trou­

ble to perplex a very clear subject.

[100] Nemesianus (in the Cynegeticons) seems

to anticipate in his fancy that auspicious day.

[101] He won all the crowns from Nemesianus,

with whom he vied in didactic poetry. The senate

erected a statue to the son of Carus, with a very

ambiguous inscription, "To the most powerful of

orators." See Vopiscus in Hist. August, p. 251.

[102] A more natural cause at least, than that

assigned by Vopiscus, (Hist. August, p. 251.) in-

ceslan: weeping for his father's death.

[103] In the Persian war, Aper was suspected of

a design to betray Carus. Hist. August, p. 250.

[104] We are obliged to the Alexandrian Chro­

nicle, p. 274, for the knowledge of the time and

place where Diocletian was elected emperor.

reason why Diocletian killed Aptr, (a wiid boar)

was sounded on a prophecy and a pun, as foolish as

they are well known.

[108] Eutropius marks its

rately; it was between the Mons Aureus and Vi-

miniacum. M. Danville, (Geographic Ancienne,

torn. i. p. 304.) places Margus at Kastolatz in

Servia, a little below Belgrade and Semendria.

JlL The town seems to have been properly

Doclia, from a small tribe of Illyrians; (fee Cella-

rius, Geograph. Antiqua, torn. i. p. 393.) and the

original same of the fortunate flave was probably

Docles; he first lengthened it to the Grecian har­

mony of Diocles, and at length to the Roman ma­

jesty of Diocletianus. He likewise assumed the

Patrician name of Valerius, and it is usually given

him by Aurelius Victor.

book of Horace. Cornel. Nepos, in Vit. Eumen.

[3] Lactantius (or whoever was the author of

the little treatise De Mort.ibus Persccutorum,) ac­

cuses Diocletian of timidity in two places, c. 7, 8,

In Chap. 9, he fays of him, "erat in omni tu-

snuliu meticulofus et animi disjectus."

[4] In this encomium, Aurelius Victor seems to

convey a just, though indirect censure of the cruelty

of Consiantius. It appears from the Fasti, (that

Arislobulus remained præsect of the city, and that

he ended with Diocletian, the consulship which he

had commenced with Carinus.

[c] Aurelius Victor styles Diocletian, " Parentem

potius quam Dominum. See Hist. August, p. 30.

[6] The question of the time when Maximian re­

ceived the honours of Cæsar and Augustus has di­

vided modern critics, and given occasion to a great

deal of learned wrangling. I have followed M. de

Tiilemont, (Histoire des Empereurs, torn. iv. p.
