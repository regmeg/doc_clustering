OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 411

Though the characters of Constantine and Maxentiua had very Maximian

little affinity with each other, their situation and interest were the
daughter

same; and prudence seemed to require that they should unite their the tit'e of

forces against the common enemy. Notwithstanding the superiority °o constan-'

of his age and dignity, the indefatigable Maximian passed the ^"'^ 307>

Alps, and courting a personal interview with the sovereign of Gaul, 3lstMarch-

carried with him his daughter Fausta as the pledge of the new

alliance. The marriage was celebrated at Aries with every circum­

stance of magnificence; and the ancient colleague of Diocletian,

who again asserted his claim to the western empire, conferred on

his son-in-law and ally the title of Augustus. By consenting to

receive that honour from Maximian, Constantine seemed to embrace

the cause of Rome and of the senate; but his professions were am­

biguous, and his assistance flow and ineffectual. He considered

with attention the approaching contest between the masters of Italy

and the emperor of the East, and was prepared to consult his own

safety or ambition in the event of the war *\

The importance of the occasion called for the presence and abi- Galerius in-

Illyricum and the East, he entered Italy, resolved to revenge the

death of Severus, and to chastise the rebellious Romans; or, as he

expressed his intentions, in the furious language of a barbarian, to

extirpate the senate, and to destroy the people by the sword. But

the skill of Maximian had concerted a prudent system of defence.

The invader found every place, hostile, fortified, and inaccessible;

and though he forced his way as far as Narni, within sixty miles

of Rome, his dominion in Italy was confined to the narrow

limits of his camp. Sensible of the increasing difficulties of his

enterprise, the haughty Galerius made the first advances towards a

reconciliation, and dispatched two of his most considerable officers

to tempt the Roman princes by the offer of a conference and the
