THE DECLINE AND FALL

emperor Hadrian must have succeeded to the throne, before Tacitus,

in the regular prosecution of his work, could relate the sire of the

capital and the cruelty of Nero towards the unfortunate Christians.

At the distance of sixty years, it was the duty of the annalist to

adopt the narratives of contemporaries; but it was natural for the

philosopher to indulge himself in the description of the origin, the

progress, and the character of the new sect, not so much accord­

most atrocious means of gratifying their implacable revenge. But the

Jews possessed very powerful advocates in the palace, and even in

the heart of the tyrant; his wife and mistress, the beautiful Poppæa,

the most horrid crimes. Under the appellation of Galilæans,

two distinctions of men were confounded, the most opposite to each
