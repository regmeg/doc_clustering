THE DECLINE AND FALL

the other, for its singularity; the former for its singular benevo­

lence, the latter for its excessive severity, i. 1 he horrid practice,

so familiar to the ancients, of exposing or murdering their new­

born infants, was become every day more frequent in the provinces,

and especially in Italy. It was the effect of distress; and the dis­

tress was principally occasioned by the intolerable burden of taxes,

and by the vexatious as well as cruel prosecutions of the officers of

the revenue against their insolvent debtors. The less opulent or less

industrious part of mankind, instead of rejoicing in an increase of

wards of Africa, directing immediate and sufficient relief to be given

to those parents who should produce, before the magistrates, the

children whom their own poverty would not allow them to educate.

But the promise was too liberal, and the provision too vague, to

public distress. It still remains an authentic monument to contradict

and confound those venal orators, who were too well satisfied with

their own situation to discover either vice or misery under the govern­

against rapes were dictated with very little indulgence, for the most

amiable weaknesses of human nature; since the description of that

crime was applied not only to the brutal violence which compelled,

but even to the gentle seduction which might persuade, an un­

married woman, under the age of twenty-five, to leave the house

of her parents. "The successful ravisher was punished with
