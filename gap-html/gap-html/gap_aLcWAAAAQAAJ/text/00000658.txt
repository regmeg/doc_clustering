"[yo] Yet hi spite of this exemption Pompey ap­

peared before that tribunal, during his consulship.

The occasion indeed was equally singular and ho­

nourable. Plutarch in Pomp. p. 630.

Hist. p. 173, 174. ,

[41] This transaction might deceive Zonaras,

who supposes that Valerian was actually declared

the colleague of Decius, 1. xii, p. 625.

•Iii; p.' 59?. As Zosimus and feme of his followers

mistake the Danube for the Tanais, they place

the field of battle in the plains of Scythia.

[45] Aurelius Victor allows two distinct actions

for the deaths of the two Decii; but I have pre­

ferred the account of Jornandes.

[46] I have ventured to copy from Tacitus

(Annal. i. 64 ) the picture of a similar engagement

between a Roman army and a German tribe.

[48] The Decii were killed before the end of

the year two hundred and fifty one, since the new

princes took possession of the consulship on the en­

suing calends of January.

[49] Hist. August, p. 223, gives them a very

honourable place among the small number of good

emperors who reigned between Augustus and Dio­

cletian.

about eighteen pounds sterling, was the usual pre­

sent made to foreign ambassadors (Livy, xxxi. 9.J.

as the time of Alexander Severus, in the

• Victor in Cæfaribus.

[55] These improbable accusations are alleged

by Zosimus, 1. i. p. 23, 24.

[;6] Jornandes, c. 19. The Gothic writer at

least observed the peace which his victorious coun­

Gallienus was associated to the empire about the

month of August of the year 253.

plain a difficult passage in Gregory of Tours,
