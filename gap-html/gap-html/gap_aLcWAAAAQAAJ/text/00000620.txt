DILIGENCE and accuracy are the only merits which an

historical writer may ascribe to himself; if any merit indeed

can be assumed from the performance of an indispensable duty. I

may therefore be allowed to say, that I have carefully examined

all the original materials that could illustrate the subject which

I had undertaken to treat. Should I ever complete the extensive

design which has been flcetched out in the preface, I might per­

haps conclude it with a critical account of the authors consulted

during the progress of the whole work j and however such an

attempt might incur the censure of ostentation, I am persuaded,

that it would be susceptible of entertainment as well as information.

At present I shall content myself with a single observation. The

Biographers, who, under the reigns of Diocletian and Constantine,

composed, or rather compiled, the lives of the emperors, from

Hadrian to the sons of Carus, are usually mentioned under the

names of Ælius Spartianus, Julius Capitolinus, Ælius Lampridius,

Vulcatius Gallicanus, Trebellius Pollio, and Flavius Vopiscus.

But there is so much perplexity in the titles of the MSS; and so many

disputes have arisen among the critics (fee Fabricius Biblioth. Latin.

I. iii. c. 6.) concerning their number, their names, and their re­

spective property, that for the most part I have quoted them with­

out distinction, under the general and well known title of the

Augustan History.
