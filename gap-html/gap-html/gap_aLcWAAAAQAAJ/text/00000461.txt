OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

back into the city over the Milvian bridge, but the crowds which

-pressed together through that narrow passage, forced him into the  
river, where he was immediately drowned by the weight of his

armour °9. His body, which had funk very deep into the mud,

*ras found with some difficulty the next day. The fight of his head,  
when it was exposed to the eyes of the people, convinced them of their

deliverance, and admonished them to receive, with acclamations of

Joyalty and gratitude, the'fortunate Constantine, who thus atchieved

had shared his prosperity and his crimes: but when the Roman

people loudly demanded a greater number of victims, he resisted,

with firmness and humanity, those servile clamours which were

dictated by flattery as well as by resentment. Informers were

punished and discouraged; the innocent, who had suffered under

the late tyranny, were recalled from exile, and restored to their

estates. A general act of oblivion quieted the minds and settled

the property of the people, both in Italy and in Africa 7\ The

he recapitulated his own services and exploits in a modest oration,

assured that illustrious order of his sincere regard, and promised

to re-establish its ancient dignity and privileges. The grateful

senate repaid these unmeaning professions by the empty titles of

honour, which it was yet in their power to bestow; and without

presuming to ratify the authority of Constantine, they passed a

decree to assign him the first rank among the three Augufii who
