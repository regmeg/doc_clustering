xviii NOTES ON THE FIFTH CHAPTER.

[22] Herod. 1. ii. p. 68. The chronicle of John

Malala, of Antioch, fliews the zealous attachment

of his countrymen to these festivals, which at once

gratified their superstition, and their love of pleasure.

[23] A king of Thebes, in Egypt, is mentioned

in the Augustan History, as an ally, and, indeed,

as a personal friend ofNiger. If Spartianus is not,

as I strongly suspect, mistaken, he has brought to

light a dynasty of tributary princes totally unknowa

to history.

[24] Dion, I. Ixxiii, p. 1*38. Herod. U ii p..67.

A veise in every one's mouth at that time, seems to

express the general opinion of the three rivals;

Optimus est Niger,, bonus Afer, peffimus Albus.

Hist. August, p. 75.

[25] Herodian, 1. ii. p. 7-1.

[26] See an account of that memorable war in

Velleius Patercnlus, ii. 110, &c. who served in the

army of Tiberius.

[27] Such is the reflection of Herodian, 1: ii.

p. 74. Will the modern Austrians allow the in­

fluence?

[28] In the letter to Albinus, already mentioned,

Commodus accuses Severus, as one of the ambitious

generals who censured his conduct, and wished to

occupy his place. Hist. August, p. 80.

[29] Pannonia was too poor to supply such a sura.

It was probably promised in the camp, and paid at

Rome, aster the victory.^ In fixing the sum, I have

adopted the conjecture os Casaubon. See Hist.

August, p. 66. Comment, p. 115.

[3s] Herodian, 1, ii. p. 78. Severus was declared

emperor on the banks of the Danube, either at

Carnuntum, according to Spartianus (Hist August,

p. 6^ ), or else at Sabaria, according to Victor.

Mr Hume, in supposing that the birth and dignity

of Severus were too much inferior to the imperial

crown, and that he marched into Italy as general

only, has not considered this transaction with his

usual accuracy (Essay on t.he original contract).

[31] Velleius Paterculus, Lit. c. iii. We must

reckon the march from the nearest verge of Pan­

nonia, and extend the fight of the city, as far at

two hundred miles.

[32] This is not a puerile figure of rhetoric, but

an allusion to a real fact recorded by Dion, 1. lxxi..

p. 1181. It probably happened more than once.

[33] Dion, 1. Ixxiii. p. 1233. Herodian, I. ii.,

p. 81. There is no surer proof of the military

skill of the Romans, than their first surmounting the

idle terror, and afterwards disdaining the dangerous

use of elephants in war.

[34] Hill. August, p. 62, 63..

[35] Victor and Eutropius, viii. 17. mention a.

combat near the fViilviao Bridge, the Ponte Moile,

unknown to the better and more ancient writers.

[36] Dion, 1. Ixxiii. p» 1740.. Herodian, 1. ii.

p. 83. Hist. August, p. 631

[37] From these sixty-six days, we must first da-

duct sixteen, as Pertinax was murdered on the 28th-

of March, and Severus most probably elected on

the 13th of April (see Hist. August, p. 65. and

JTillemont Hist, des Empereurs, torn. iii. p. 393.

Note 7.). We cannot allow less than ten days after

his election, to put a. numerous army in motion.

Forty days remain for this rapid march, and as we

may compute, about eight hundred miles from

Rome to the neighbourhood of Vienna, the army,

of Severus marched twenty miles every day, with*-

out halt or intermission.

[38] Dion (1. Ixxiv. p. 1241.). Herodian, 1. iu

p. 84.

[39] Dion (1. Ixxiv. p. 1244.), who assisted at the

ceremony as a senator, gives a most pompous de­

scription of it.

[40] Herodian, I. iii. p. M2»

[41] Though it is not, most assuredly, the inter*

tion of Lucan, to exalt the character of Cæsar, yet

the idea he gives of that hero, in the tenth book

of the Pharfalia, where he describes him, at the

fame time, making love to Cleopatra, sustaining i,

fiege against the power of Egypt, and conversing

with the sages of the country, is, in reality, the

noblest panegyric.

[42] Reckoning from his election, April 13,

193, to the death of Albinus, February 19, 197.
