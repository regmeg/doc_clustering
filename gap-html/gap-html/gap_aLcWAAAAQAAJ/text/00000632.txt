NOTES ON THE THIRD CHAPTER,

umbra*, is the indignant expression of Locan, but

it is a patriotic, rather than a devout indignation.

[25] Dion Cassias, 1. liii. p. 710, with the cu­

rious annotations of Reymar.

[26] As Octavianus advanced to the banquet of

the Cæsars, his colour changed like that of the

camelion; pale at first, then red, afterwards black,

he at last assumed the mild livery of Venus and

the Graces (Cæsares, p. 309). This image employed

by Julian, in his ingenious fiction, is just and ele­

gant: but when he .considers this change of cha­

racter as real, and ascribes it to the power of phi­

losophy; he does too much honour to philosophy,

and to Octavianus.

[27] Two centuries after the establishment of

monarchy, the emperor Marcus Antoninns recom­

mends the character of Brutus as a perfect model of

Roman virtue.

[28] It is much to be regretted, that we have

lost the part of Tacitus, which treated of that trans­

action. We are forced to content ourselves with

the popular rumours of Josephus, and the imperfect

hints of Dion and Suetonius.

[29] Augustus restored the ancient severity of

discipline. After the civil wars, he dropped the

endearing name of Fellow-Soldiers, and called them

only Soldiers (Sueton. in August c. 2;.). See the

use Tiberius made of the senate in the mutiny of

the Pannonian legions (Tacit Annal. i.).

[30] These words seem to have been the constitu­

tional language. See Tacit. Annal. xiii. 4.

[31] The first was Camillus Scribonianus, who

took up arms in Dalmatia against Claudius, and

was deserted by his own troops in five days. The

second, L. Antonius, in Germany, who rebelled

against Domitian; and the third, Avidius Cassius,

in the reign of M. Antoninus. The two last

reigned but a few months, and were cut off by their

own adherents. We may observe, that both Ca­

millus and Cassius coloured their ambition with

the design of restoring the republic; a task, said

Cassius, peculiarly reserved for his name and fa­

mily.

[34] This idea is frequently and strongly in­

culcated by Tacitus. See Hist. i. 5. 16. ii. 76.

[35] The emperor Vespasian, with his usual good

sense, laughed at the Genealogists, who deduced his

family from Flavius, the founder of Reate (his na­

tive country), and one of the companions of Her-,

cules. Sueton. in Vespasian, i. 12.

[383 Dio (1. Ixix. p. 1249.) affirms the whole

to have been a fiction, on the authority of his fa­

ther, who being governor of the province where

Trajan died, had very good opportunities of sifting

this mysterious transaction. Yet Dodwell (Prælect.

Camden. xvii.) has maintained, that Hadrian was

called to the certain hope of the empire, during the

life-time of Trajan.

[40] The deification of Antinous, his medals,

statues, temples, city, oracles, and constellation,

are well known, and still dishonour the memory of

Hadrian. Yet we may remark, that of the first

fifteen emperors, Claudius was the only one whose

taste in love was entirely correct. For the honours

of Antinous, fee Spanheim, Commentaires fur les

Cæsars de Julien, p. 80.

[42] Without the help of medals and inscrip­

tions, we should be ignorant of this fact, so ho­

nourable to the memory of Pins.

reign, Marcus was only two nights absent from the

palace, and even those were at different times. Hist.

sible to the charms of the fail sex. Marcus Anto­
