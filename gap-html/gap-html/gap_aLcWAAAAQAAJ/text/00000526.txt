THE DECLINE AND FALL

the Tyber was supposed to have "been honoured with the preaching

and martyrdom of the twa most eminent among the apostles1,0»

and the bishops of Rome very prudently claimed the inheritance of

whatsoever prerogatives were attributed either to the person or to

the office of Saint Peter The bishops of Italy and of the pro­

vinces, were disposed to allow them a primacy of order and associa­

tion (such was their very accurate expression) in the Christian ari­

stocracy "*. But the power of a monarch was rejected with ab­

horrence, and the aspiring genius as Rome experienced from the

nations of Asia and Africa, a more vigorous resistance to her spiri­

tual than she had formerly done to her temporal dominion. The

patriotic Cyprian, who ruled with the most absolute sway the church

of Carthage and the provincial synods, opposed with resolution and

success the ambition of the Roman pontiff, artfully connected his

own cause with that of the eastern bishops, aud, like Hannibal,

sought out new allies in the heart of Asia If this Punic war

was carried on without any effusion of blood, it was owing much

less to the moderation than to the weakness of the contending pre­

lates. Invectives and excommunications were their only weapons;

and these, during the progress of the whole controversy, they

hurled against each other with equal fury and devotion. The hard

necessity of censuring either a pope, or a saint and martyr, distresses

the modern catholics whenever they are obliged to relate the par­

ticulars of a dispute, in which the champions of religion indulged

such passions as seem much more adapted to the senate or to the

camp'

The progress of the ecclesiastical authority gave birth to the me­

morable distinction of the laity and of the clergy, which had been

unknown to the Greeks and Romans ,,J. The former of these

appellations comprehended the body of the Christian people; the

latter, according to the signification of the word, was appropriated

to the chosen portion that had been set apart for the service of

2 religion;
