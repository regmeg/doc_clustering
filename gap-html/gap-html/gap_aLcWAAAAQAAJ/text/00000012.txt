PREFACE.

word, deserves the epithet of imperfect, I eon<-

fider myself as contracting an engagement to finish,

most probably in a second volume, the first of these

memorable periods; and to deliver to the Public, the

complete history of the Decline and Fall of Rome,

from the age of the Antonines, to the subversion of

the Western Empire. With regard to the subsequent

periods, though I may entertain some hopes, I dare

not presume to give any assurances. The execution

of such an extensive plan, as I have traced out, and

which might perhaps be comprehended in about four

volumes, would fill up the long interval between

ancient and modern history; but it would require

many years of health, of leisure, and of perseveÂ­

rance.
