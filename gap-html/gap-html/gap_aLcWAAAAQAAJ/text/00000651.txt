NOTES ON THE EIGHTH CHAPTER. xxxi

[31] These colonies were extremely numerous.

Seleucus Nicat»r founded thirty-nine cities, all

named from himself, or some of his relations (fee

Appian in Syriac, p. 1 24.). The æra of Seleucus

(still in use among the Eastern Christians) appears as

late as the year 508, of Christ 196, on the medals

of the Greek cities within the Parthian empire.

See Moyle's works, vol. i. p. 273, &c. and M.

Froret. Mem. ds PAcademic, torn. xix.

[32] The modern Persians distinguish that period

as the dynasty of the kings of the nations. See

Plin. Hist. Nat. vi. 25.

[33] Eutychius (torn. i. p. 367. 371. 375.) re­

lates the siege of the island of Mesene in the Tigris,

with some circumstances not unlike the story of

Nisus and Scylla.

[34] Agathias, ii. 164. The princes of Se-

gestan defended their independence for many years.

As romances generally transport to an ancient pe­

riod the events of their own time, it is not impos­

sible, that the fabulous exploits of Rustan prince of

Segestan may have been grafted on this real history.

[37] For the precise situation of Babylon, Se-

leucia, Ctesiphon, Modain, and Bagdad, cities often

confounded with each other; fee an excellent Geo­

[40] That most curious traveller Bernier (fee

Hist, de Voyages, torn, x.) who followed the camp

ef Aurengzebe from Dehli to Castimir, describes with

great accuracy that immense moving city. 1 he

guard of cavalry consisted of 35,000 men, that of

infantry of io,ooq. ft was computed that the camp

contained 150,000 horses, mules, and elephants;

50,000 camels, 5o,coo oxen, and between 300,000

and 400,000 persons. Almost all Dehli followed the

court, whose magnificence supported its industry.

Eutrop. viii. 10. Euseb, in Chronic. Quadratus

(quoted in the Augustan History) attempted to vin­

dicate the Romans, by alleging, that the citizens

of Scleucia had first violated th.ir faith.

[43] The polished citizens of Antioch, called

those of Edessa, mixed barbarians. It was, however,

some praise, that of the three dialects of the Syriac,

the purest and most elegant (the Aramæan) was

spoke at Edessa. This remark M. Bayer (Hist.

Edess. p. 5.) has borrowed from George of Ma-

latia a Syrian Writer.

[41] Dion, 1 lxxv. p. 1248, 1249, 1250. M.Bayer

has neglected to use this most important passage.

[45] This kingdom, from Osrhoes, who gave a-

new name to the country, to the last Abgarus, had

lasted 353 years. See the learned work of M.

Bayer, Historia Osrhoena et Edessena»

[4.6] Xenophon, in the preface to the Cyropaedia,

gives a clear and magnificent idea of the extent of

the empire of Cyrus. Herodotus (1. iii. c. 79, &c.)

enters into a curious and particular description of

the twenty great Satrapies into which the Persiaa

empire was divided by Darius Hystaspes.

[47] Herodian, vi. 209. 212.

[4S] There were two hundred scythed chariots*

at the battle of Arbela, in the host of Darius. Ia

the vast army of Tigranes, which was vanquished by

Lucullus, seventeen thousand horse only were com­

pletely armed. Antiochus brought fifty-four ele­

phants into the field against the Romans: by his

frequent wars and negociations with the princes of

India, he had once collected an hundred and fifty of

those great animals; but it may be questioned,,

whether the most powerful monarch of Hindostaa

ever formed a line of battle of seven hundred

elephants.

[51] M. de Tillemont has already observed, that

Herodian's geography is somewhat confused.

[5:] Moses of Chorene (Hist. Armen. 1, ii. c. 71.J.

illustrates this invasion of Media, by asserting, that

Chosroes, king of Armenia, defeated Artaxerxes,

and pursued him to the confines of India. The

exploit*
