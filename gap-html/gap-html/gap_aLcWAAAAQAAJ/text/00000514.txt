THE DECLINE AND FALL

mode of interpretation. :Ambitious to exalt the perfection of the

gospel above the wisdom of philosophy,, the zealous fathers have

carried the duties of self-mortification, of purity, and of patience*

to a height which it is scarcely possible to attain, and much less

to preserve, in our present state of weakness and corruption. A

undaunted courage of a single man. To the love of pleasure- we

may therefore ascribe most of the agreeable, to the love of action

we may attribute most of the useful and respectable, qualifications-

by the common consent of mankind, as utterly incapable of pro­

curing any happiness to the individual, or any public benefit to

the world. But it was not in this world that the primitive
