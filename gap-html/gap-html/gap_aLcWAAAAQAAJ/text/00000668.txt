xlviii NOTES ON THE TWELFTH CHAPTER.

that Probus assumed the empire in Illyricum; an

opinion which (though adopted by a very learned

man) would throw that period of history into in­

extricable confusion.

[21] Hist. August, p. 229.

[22] He was to fend judges to the Parthians,

Persians, and Sarmatians, a president to Taprobana,

and a proconsul to the Roman island (supposed by

Cafaubon and Salmasius to mean Britain). Such a

history as mine (fays Vopifcus with proper modesty)

will not subsist a thousand years to expose or justify

the prediction.

[23] For the private life of Probus, fee Vopifcus

in Hist. August, p. 234—237.

[24] According to the Alexandrian Chronicle,

he was fifty at the time of his death.

[25] The letter was addressed to the pr*torian

prefect, whom (on condition of his good behaviour)

he promised to continue in his great office. See

Hist. August, p. 237.

[26] Vopifcus in Hist. August, p. 237. The

date of the letter is assuredly faulty. Instead of

Nou. Fttrutr. we may read Nun, August.

[27] Hist. August, p. 238. It is odd, that the

senate should treat Probus less favourably than Mar­

cus Antoninus. That prince had received, even be­

fore the death of Pius Jui quintue rtlatioais. See

Capitolin. in Hist. August, p. 24.

[28] See thedutiful letter of Probus to the senate,

after his German victories. Hist. August, p 239.

[29] The date and duration of the reign of Pro-

bus are very correctly ascertained by Cardinal Noris,

in his learned work, De Epochis Syro-Macedonum,

p. 96—105. A passage of Eufebius connects the

second years of Probus, with the æras of several of

the Syrian cities.

[30] Vopifcus in Hist. August, p. 239.

[31] Zosimus (1. i. p. 62—65.) tells a very long

and trifling story of Lycius the Isaurian robber.

[32] Zosim. 1. i. p. 6y. Vopifcus in Hist. Au­

gust, p. 239, 240. But it seems incredible, that the

defeat of the Savages of Æthiopia could affect the

Persian monarch.

[33] Besides these well-known chiefs, several

others are named by Vopifcus (Hist. August, p.

2; 1). whose actions have not reached our know­

ledge.

[34] See the Cæsars of Julian and Hist. August,

p. 238, 24c, 241.

But the latter supposes the punishment inflicted with

the consent of their kings; if so, it was partial like

the offence.

[36] See Cluver. Germania Antiqua, 1. iii. Pto­

lemy places in their country the city of Calisia,

probably Calilh in Silesia.

[37] Ferolit umbra, is the expression of Tacitus:

it is surely a very bold one.

[40] Hist. August, p. 238, 239. Vopifcus quotes

a letter from the emperor to the senate, in which he

mentions his design of reducing Germany into a

province.

[41] Strabo, 1. vii. According to Velleius Pater-

culus (ii. 108.) Maroboduus led his Marcomanni

into Bohemia: Cluverius (German. Antiq. iii. 8.)

proves that it was from Swabia.

were denominated, Decumatet. Tacit. Germania,

[43] See Notes de l'Abbe de la Bleterie a la

Germanic do Tacite, p. 183. His account of the

wall is chiefly borrowed (as he fays himself J from

the Alsatia Illustrate of Schœpflin.

[44] See Recherches fur les Chinois et les Egyp-

tiens, torn. ii. p. 8(—102. The anonymous author

is well acquainted with the globe in general, and

with Germany in particular: with regard to the

latter, he quotes a work of M. Hanfelman; but

he seems to confound the wall of Probus, designed

against the Alemanni, with the fortification of the
