viction and punishment of the Christians, the fate of those sectaries* a.n£i
toiera-

in an extensive and arbitrary government, must still, in a great mea­

sure, have depended on their own behaviour, the circumstances of

the times, and the temper of their supreme as well as subordinate

rulers. Zeal might sometimes provoke, and: prudence might some­

times avert or assuage, the superstitious f\iry of 1<he pagan6. A va*

riety of motives might dispose the provincial' governors either to

enforce or to relax the execution of the laws.; and of these motives,

the most forcible was their regard not only for the public edicts,

but for the secret intentions of the emperor, a glance from whose

eye was sufficient to kindle or to extinguish the flames of persecu­

different parts of the empire, the primitive Christians lamented and

perhaps magnified their own sufferings ; but the celebrated number The ten

sperous or adverse fortunes of the church, from the age of Nero to

that of Diocletian. The ingenious parallels of the ten plagues of

Egypt, arid' of the ten horns of the Apocalypse, first suggested this

calculation to their minds, and in their application of the faith of

prophecy to the truth of history, they were careful to select those

reigns which, were indeed the most hostile to the Christian cause ,OJ.

But these transient persecutions, served only to revive the zeal^ and to

restore the discipline of the faithful: and the moments of extraor­

dinary rigour were compensated by much longer intervals of peace

and security. The indifference of some princes, and the indulgence

of others, 'permitted"the Christiarfs to enjoy, though not peifiaps a

legal, yet an^actuaVand public toleration of their religion;
