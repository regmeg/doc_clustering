[18] Mr. Hume is justly surprised at a passage of

Herodian, (i iv. p. 159.) who, on this occasion, re­

presents the imperial palace, as equal io extent to

the rest of Rome. The whole region of the Pala­

tine Mount on which it was built, occupied, .at most,

a circumference of eleven or twelve thousand feet.

(See the Notitia and Victor, in Nardini's Roma

Antica.) But we should recollect that the opulent

senators had almost surrounded the city with their

extensive gardens and suburb palaces, the greatest

part of which had been gradually confiscated by

the emperors, if Geta resided in the gardens that

bore his name on the Janiculum; and if Caracalla.

inhabited the gardens o* Mecænas on the Efque-

line, the rival brothers were separated from each

other by the distance of several miles; and yet

the in termed fa re space was filled by the imperial

gardens of Salluft, of Lucullus, of Agrippa, of Do­

mitian, of Caius, &c. all skirting round the city,

and all connected with each other, and with the

palace, by bridges thrown over the Tyber and the

streets. But this explanation of Herodian would

require, though it ill deserves, a particular disserta-i

tion, illustrated by a map of ancient Rome.

[21] Caracalla consecrated, in the temple of Se-

rapis, the sword, with which, a« he boasted, he had

iain his brother Gets, Dion, 1. Ixxvii. p. 1307.

[22] Herodian, I. iv. p. 147.. In every Roman

camp there was a small chapel near the head­

quarters, in which the statues of the tutelar deities

were preserved and adored; and we may remark,

that the eagles, and other military ensigns, were in

the first rank of these deities: an excellent institu­

tion, which confirmed discipline by the sanction

of religion. See Lipsius de Militia Romana, iv. 5.

[24] Geta was placed among the gods. Sit divut,

dum non fit minus, said his brother. Hist. August,

p. 91. Some marks of Geta's consecration arc

still found upon medals.

[25] Dion, 1. Ixxvii. p. 1307..

[26] Dion, 1 Ixxvii. p. 1290. Herodian, 1. iv..

p. 1 50. Dion (p. 129S.) fays, that the comic poets

no longer durst employ the name of Geta in their

plays, and that the estates of those who mentioned

it in their testaments,. were confiscated.

[27] Caracalla had assumed the names of several,

conquered nations; Pertinax observed, that the

name of Giticut (he had obtained some advantage of

the Goths or Getæ) would be a proper addition to>

Parthicus, Alemannicus, &c. Hist. August, p. 89.

[2S] Dion, 1. Ixxvii. p. 1291. He was proba­

bly descended from Helvidius Prifcus, and Thrasea

Pætus, those patriots whose firm, but useless and'

unscasonable virtue, has been immortalized by.

Tacitus.

[29] It is said, that Papinian was himself a rela*

tion of the empress Julia.

Historia Juris Romani, 1. 33c, &c.

[33] Tiberius and Domitian never moved from •

the neighbourhood of .Rome. Nero made a short

journey into Greece. "Et laudatorum Principum

ufus ex æquo quamvis procul agentibus. S«evi

proximisingruunt." Tacit. Hist. iv. 75.

[35] Dion, L Ixxvii. p. 1307. Herodian, 1. iv.

p. 1 58. The former represents it as a cruel massacre,

the latter as a perfidious one too. it seems pro­

bable, that the Alexandrian* had irritated the ty­

rant
