5i8 THE DECLINE AND FALL

was confirmed by innumerable prodigies. The,lame walked, the

blind saw, the sick were healed, the dead were raised, dæmons were

expelled, and the laws of Nature were perpetually suspended for

General the benefit of the church. But the sages of Greece and Rome turned

silence con­

cerning the aside from the awful spectacle, and pursuing the ordinary occupa-

th" Passion, tions of life and study, appeared unconscious of any alterations
in

the moral or physical government of the world. Under the reign

of Tiberius, the whole earth "9\ or at least a celebrated province of

the Roman empirewas involved in a preternatural darkness of

three hours. Even this miraculous event, which ought to have ex­

cited the wonder, the curiosity, and the devotion of mankind, passed

without notice in an age of science and history '9+. It happened

during the lifetime of Seneca and the elder Pliny, who must have

experienced the immediate effects, or received the earliest intelli­

gence of the prodigy. Each of these philosophers, in a laborious

work, has recorded all the great phenomena of Nature, earth­

quakes, meteors, comets, and eclipses, which his indefatigable curi­

osity could collect Both the one and the other have omitted to

mention the greatest phenomenon to which the mortal eye has been

witness since the creation of the globe. A distinct chapter of

Pliny 196 is devoted to eclipses of an extraordinary nature and un­

usual duration; but he contents himself with describing the singular

defect of light which followed the murder of Cæsar, when, during

the greatest part of a year, the orb of the fun appeared pale and

without splendor. This season of obscurity, which cannot surely

be compared with the preternatural darkness of the Passion, had been

already celebrated by most of the poets'97 and historians of that

memorable age '9\
