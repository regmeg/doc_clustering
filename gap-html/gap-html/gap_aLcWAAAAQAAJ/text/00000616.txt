DECLINE AND FALL THE

stowed on the prisoners After the church had triumphed over all

her enemies, the interest as well as vanity of the captives prompted

them to magnify the merit of their respective suffering. A conve­

nient distance of time or place gave an ample scope to the progress

of fiction; and the frequent instances which might be alleged of

holy martyrs, whose wounds had been- instantly healed, whose

strength had been renewed* and whose lost members had miracu­

lously been restored, were of sufficient weight to remove every diffi­

culty, and to silence every objection. The most extravagant legends,

as they conduced to the honour of the church, were applauded by

the credulous multitude, countenanced by the power of the clergy,

and attested by the suspicious evidence of ecclesiastical history.

The vague descriptions of exile and imprisonment, of pain and

torture, are so easily exaggerated or softened by the pencil of an

artful orator, that we are naturally induced to inquire into a fact

of a more distinct and stubborn kind; the number of persons who

'suffered death in consequence of the edicts published by Diocletian,

his associates, and his successors. The recent legendaries record

whole armies and cities, which were at once swept away by the

undistinguishing rage of persecution. The more ancient writers content

themselves with pouring out a liberal effusion of loose and tragical in­

vectives, without condescending to ascertain the precise number of

those persons who were permitted to seal with their blood their belief

of the gospel. From the history of Eusebius, it may however be col­

lected, that only nine bishops were punished with death; and we are

assured, by his particular enumeration of the martyrs of Palestine,

that no more than ninety-two Christians were intitled to that ho­

nourable appellation ,8\ As we are unacquainted with the degree

of episcopal zeal and courage which prevailed at that time, it is not

in our power to draw any useful inferences from the former of these

facts: but the latter may serve to justify a very important and pro­

bable conclusion. According to the distribution of Roman provinces,
