xxxi» NOTES ON THE NINTH CHASTEk.

[56] The Helvetian nation which issued from

the country called Switzerland, contained, of every

age and sex, 368,^00 persons (Caesar de Bell.

Call. i. 29.). At present, the number of people

in the Pays de Vaud (a small district on the banks

cf the Leman Lake, much more distinguished for

politeness than for industry) amounts to 112,591.

See an excellent Tract of M. Muret, in the Me-

jnoires de la Societie de Berne.

[57] Paul Diaconus, c. 1, 2, 3. Machiavel,

Davila, and the reft of Paul's follower?, represent

these emigrations too much as regular and con­

certed measures.

[38] Sir William Temple and Montesquieu have

indulged, on this subject, the usual liveliness of

their fancy.

Essays.

[41] Tacit. G^-rm. 4f, 45.. Frenlhemius (who

dedicated his supplement to Livy, to Christina of

Sweden) thinks proper to be very angry with the

Roman who expressed so very little reverence for

Northern queens.

[42] May we not suspect that superstition was

the parent of despotism? The descendants of Odin

(whose race was not extinct till the year 1060) are

said to have reigned in Sweden above a thousand

years. The temple of Upsal was the ancient feat of

religion and empire. In the year 1153 I find a

singular law prohibiting the use and posseffion of

arras to any, except the king's guards. Is it not

probable that it was coloured by the pretence of

reviving an old institution? See Dalin's History

of Sweden in the Bibliotheque Raisonnee, torn,

xl. and xlv.

[44] Id. c. ii, 12, 13, &c.

[4.5] Grotius changes an expression of Tacitus,

ptrlraliantur into pr<stra3aiitur. The correction

is equally j'jst and ingenious.

[46] Even in our ancient parliament, the barons

often carried a question, not so much by the

number of votes as by that of their anfied fol­

lowers.

[47] CæTar de Bell. Gall. vi. 23.

[48] Minuunt controversias, is a very happy

expression of Cæsar's.

[54] Esprit des Loix, I. xxx. c. 3. The bril­

liant imagination of Montesquieu is corrected,

however, by the dry cold reason of the Abbs de

Mably. Observations fur l'Histoire de France,

torn. i. p. 35*.

[56] The adulteress was whipped through the-

village. Neither wealth nor beauty could inspire

compaslion, or procure her a second hulband, 18, 19.

(57] Ovid employs two hundred lines in the

research of places the most favourable to love.

Above all he considers the theatre as the best adapted

to collect the beauties of Rome, and to melt them

into tenderness and sensuality.

[58] Tacit. Hist. iv. 61. 65.

[59] The marriage present was a yoke of oxen,

horses, and arms. See Germ. c. 18. Tacitus is

somewhat too florid on the subject.

[60] The change of txigtrt into exugere is a most

excellent correction.

[61] Tacit. Germ. c. 7. Plutarch in Mario.

Before the wives of the Teutones destroyed them­

selves and their children, they had offered to sur­

render, on condition that they should be received

as the staves of the vestal virgins.

[62] Tacitus has employed a few lines, and

Cluverius one hundred and twenty-four pages, on

this obscure subject. The former discovers in Ger­

many
