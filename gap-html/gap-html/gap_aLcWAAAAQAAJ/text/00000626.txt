[15] In the year of Rome 701, the temple of

Iii s and Serapis was demolished by the order of the

senate, (Dion Cassius, 1. xl. p. 252) and even by the

handtof the consul (ValeriusMaximus.i. 3.). After the

death of Cæsar, it was restored at the public expence

(Dion, 1. xlvii. p. 501.) When Augustus was in Egypt

he revered the majesty of Serapis, (Dion, 1. H.

p. 647.) but in the Pomærium of Rome, and a mile

round it, he prohibited the worship of the Egyptian

gods (Dion, 1. liii. p. 679. 1. liv. p. 735.). They

remained, however, very fashionable under his

reign, (Ovid, de Art. Amand. 1. i.) and that of his

successor, till the justice of Tiberius was provoked

to some acts of severity. (See Tacit. Annal. ii. 85.

[25] Mæcenas had advised him to declare by one

edict, all his subjects, citizens. But we may justly

S

suspect that the historian Dion was the author of a

council, so much adapted to the practice of his own

age, and so little to that of Augustus.

[26] The senators were obliged to have one third

of their own landed property in Italy, See Plin.

1. vi. ep. 19. The qualification was reduced by

Marcus to one fourth. Since the reign of Trajan,

Italy had funk nearer to the level of the provinces.

[27] The first part of the Verona illustrata of the

marquis Massei, gives the clearest and most com­

prehensive view of the state of Italy under the

Cæsars.

[28] See Pausanias, 1. vii. The Romans con­

descended to restore the names of those assemblies,

when they could no longer be dangerous.

[29] They are frequently mentioned by Cæsar.

The Abbe Dubos attempts, with very little success,

to prove that the assemblies of Gaul were continued

under the emperors. Histoire de l'Etablissement de

Monarchic Francoisc, 1. i. c. 4.

the massacre to 1; 0,000 citizens; but I stiould esteem

the smaller number to be more than sufficient.

[32] Twenty-five colonies were settled in Spain

(see Plin. Hist. Natur. iii. 3, 4. iv. 55): and nine

in Britain, of which London, Colchester, Lincoln,

Chester, Gloucester, and Bath, still remain con­

siderable cities (fee Richard of Cirencester, p. 36,

and Whitaker's History of Manchester, 1 i. c. 3).

emperor Hadrian expressed his surprise, that the

cities of Utica, Gades, and Itatica, which already

enjoyed the rights of Munkipia, (hould solicit the

title of cehnits. Their example, however, became

fashionable, and the empire was filled with hono­

rary colonies. See Spanheim, de Ufa Numisinatum,
