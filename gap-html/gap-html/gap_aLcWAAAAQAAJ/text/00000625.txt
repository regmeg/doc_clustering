NOTES ON THE SECOND CHAPTER. v

[84] Dion Caffius, lxviii. p. 1131.

[ ^] Ptolemy and Strabo, with the modern geo­

graphers, fix the Isthmus of Suez as the boundary of

Asia and Africa. Dionysius, Mela, Pliny, Sailust,

Hiriius, and Solinus, have preferred for that pur­

pose the western branch of the Nile, or even the

great Catabathrnus, or descent, which last would

resign to Asia, not only Egypt, but part of Libya.

[86] The long range, moderate height, and

gentle declivity of mount Atlas (see Shaw's tra­

vels, p. are very unlike a solitary mountain

which rears its head into the clouds, and seems to

support the heavens. The Peak of Teneriff, on

the contrary, rises a league and a half above the

surface of the sea, and as it was frequently visited

by the Phœnicians, might engage the notice of the

Greek poets. See Buffon, Histoire Naturelle,

torn. i. p. 312. Histoire des Voyages, torn. ii.

[87] M. de Voltaire, torn. xiv. p. 297, un­

supported by either fact or probability, has gene­

rously bestowed the Canary Islands on the Roman

empire.

[88] Bergier, Hist, des Grands Chemins, 1. iii.

c. 1, 2, 3, 4, a very useful collection.

hut I distrust both the doctor's learning and his

maps.

NOTES ON THE SECOND CHAPTER.

HEY were erected about the midway be-

X tween Labor and Dehli. The conquests

of Alexander in Hindostan, were confined to the

Punjab, a country watered by the five great streams

.of the Indus.

[2] See M. de Guignes Histoire des Huns,

1, xv, xvi, and xvii.

[5] There is not any writer who describes in so

lively a manner as Herodotus, the true genius of

Polytheism. The best commentary may be found

in Mr. Hume's Natural History of Religion; and

the best contrast in Bossuet's Universal History.

Some obscure traces of an intolerant spirit appear

in the conduct of the Egyptians, (see Juvenal, Sat. xv.)

and the Christians as well as Jews, who lived un­

der the Roman empire, formed a very important

exception: so important indeed, that the discussion

will require a distinct chapter of this work.

[4] The rights, power, and pretensions of the

sovereign of Olympus, are very clearly described

in the xvth book of the Iliad: in the Greek ori­

ginal, I mean; for Mr. Pope, without perceiving it,

has improved the theology of Homer.

[?] See for instance, Cæsar de Bell. Gall. vi. 17.

Within a century or two the Gauls themselves

applied to their gods the names of Mercury, Mars,

Apollo, &c.

[6] The admirable work of Cicero de Natura

Deorum, is the best clue we have to guide us

through the dark and profound abyss. He repre­

sents with candour, and confutes with subtlety, the

opinions of the philosophers.

[7] I do not pretend to assert, that, in this isre-

ligious age, the natural terrors of superstition,

dreams, omens, apparitions, &c. had lost their

efficacy.

[8] Socrates, Epicurus, Cicero, and Plutarch,

always inculcated a decent reverence for the religion,

of their own country, and of mankind. The devo­

tion of Epicurus was assiduous and exemplars.

Diogen. Laert. x. 10.

[9] Polybius, 1. vi. c. 5?, J4. Juvenal. Sat.

xiii. laments, that in his time this apprehension had

lost much of its effect.

[10J See the fate of Syracuse, Tarentum, Am.

bracia, Corinth, &c. the conduct of Verres, in

Cicero (Actio ii. Orat. 4.), and the usual practice

of governors, in the viiith Satire of Juvenal.
