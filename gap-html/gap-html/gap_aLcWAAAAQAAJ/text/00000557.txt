OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

were far from admitting the prejudices of mankind a6 the standard

of truth, but they considered them as flowing from the original dis­

position of human nature; and they supposed that any popular mode

of faith and worship which presumed to disclaim the assistance of the

senses, would, in proportion as it receded from superstition, find

itself incapable of restraining the wanderings of the fancy and the

visions of fanaticism. The careless glance which men of wit and

learning condescended to cast on the Christian revelation, served only

to confirm their hasty opinion, and to persuade them, that the prin­

ciple which they might have revered, of the divine unity, was de­

faced by the wild enthusiasm, and annihilated by the airy specula­

tions of the new sectaries. The author of a celebrated dialogue,

which has been attributed to Lucian, whilst he affects to treat the

mysterious subject of the Trinity in a style of ridicule and con­

tempt, betrays his own ignorance of the weakness of human

reason, and of the inscrutable nature of the Divine perfections ".

It might appear less surprising, that the founder of Chri­

stianity should not only be revered by his disciples as a sage and

a prophet, but that he should be adored as a God. The Po-

lytheists were disposed to adopt every article of faith, which seemed

to offer any resemblance, however distant or imperfect, with the

popular mythology; and the legends of Bacchus, of Hercules, and

of Æsculapius, had, in some measure, prepared their imagination

for the appearance of the Son of God under a human form

But they were astonished that the Christians should abandon the

temples of those ancient heroes, who, in the infancy of the world,

had invented arts, instituted laws, and vanquished the tyrants or

monsters who infested the earth; in order to choose for the exclusive

object of their religious worship, an obscure teacher, who, in a.

recent age, and among the barbarous people, had fallen a sacrifice

either to the malice of his own countrymen, or to the jealousy of

the Roman government. The Pagan multitude, reserving their

gratitude.
