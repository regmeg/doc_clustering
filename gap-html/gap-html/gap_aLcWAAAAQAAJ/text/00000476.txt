of Greece sent their respective quotas of men and ships to the

celebrated harbour of Piræus, and their united force consisted of

no more than two hundred small vessels: a very feeble armament

if it is compared with those formidable fleets which were equipped

and maintained by the republic of Athens during the Peloponnesian

war ,c6. Since Italy was no longer the feat of government, the

naval establishments of Misenum and Ravenna had been gradually

neglected; and as the shipping and mariners-of the empire were

supported by commerce rather than by war, it was natural that they

It is only surprising, that the eastern emperor, who possessed so great a

his fortune, but by an historian, the partial enemy of his fame.

We are assured that the valiant emperor threw himself into the

river Hebrua, accompanied only by twelve horsemen, and that by
