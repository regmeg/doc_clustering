OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

church were chiefly directed against scandalous sinners, and par足

ticularly those who were guilty of murder, of fraud, or of incon足

tinence, against the authors, or the followers of any heretical

opinions which had been condemned by the judgment of the

episcopal order, and against those unhappy persons who, whether

from choice or from compulsion, had polluted themselves after their

baptisin by any act of idolatrous worship. The consequences of

excommunication were of a temporal as well as a spiritual nature.

The Christian against whom it was pronounced, was deprived of

any part in the oblations of the [faithful. The ties both of

religious and of private friendfliip were dissolved: he found himself

a prophane object of abhorrence to the persons whom he the most

esteemed, or by whom he had been the most tenderly beloved; and

as far as an expulsion from a respectable society could imprint

on his character a mark of disgrace, he was sliunned or suspected

by the generality of mankind. The situation of these unfortunate

exiles was in itself very painful and melancholy; but, as it usually

happens, their apprehensions far exceeded their sufferings. The

benefits of the Christian communion were those of eternal life, nor

could they erase from their minds the awful opinion, that to those

ecclesiastical governors by whom they were condemned, the Deity

had committed the keys of Hell and of Paradise. The heretics

indeed, who might be supported by the consciousness of their in足

tentions, and by the flattering hope that they alone had discovered

the true path of salvation, endeavoured to regain, in their separate

assemblies, those comforts, temporal as well as spiritual, which they

no longer derived from the great society of Christians. But

almost all those who had reluctantly yielded to the power of vice

or idolatry were sensible of their fallen condition, and anxiously

desirous of being restored to the benefits of the Christian com足

munion.
