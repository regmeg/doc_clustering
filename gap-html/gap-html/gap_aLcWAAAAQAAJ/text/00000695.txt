fixed by Burnet (Travels into Italy, p. 168), and is

approved by Moyle (vol. ii. p. 151). They were

both unacquainted with the passage of Chrysostom,

which converts their conjecture almost into a fact.

Donatists, whose assertion is confirmed by the tacit

acknowledgment of Augustin, Africa was the last

of the provinces which received the gospel. Tille­

seems to have been a Christian. Apolog. p. 496,

to believe, that, in the beginning of the fourth

century, the extensive dioceses of Liege, of

Treves, and of Cologne, composed a single bishop-

rick, which had been very recently founded. See

Ufernoires de Tillemont, torn. vi. part i. p. 43, 411.

[172] The date of Tertullian's Apology is fixed

in a dissertation of Molheim, to the year 198.

[173] In the fifteenth century, there were few

who had either inclination or courage to question

whether Joseph of Arimathea founded the monastery

of Glastenbury, and whether Dionysius the Areo-

pagite preferred the residence of Paris to that of

Athens.

[ 174]The stupendous metamorphosiswas perform­

ed in the ninth century. See Mariana (Hist. Hispan.

v. 10. 13.), who, in every sense, imitates Livy, and

the honest detection of the legend of St. James by

Dr. Geddes, Miscellanies, vol. ii. p. 221.

[176] See the fourth century of Molheim's His­

tory of the Church. Many, though very confused

circumstances, that relate to the conversion of Iberia

and Armenia, may be found in Moses of Chorene,

1. ii. c. 78—89.

[177] According to Tertullian, the Christia»

faith had penetrated into parts of Britain inaccessible

to the Roman arms. About a century afterwards,

Offian, the son of Fingal, is said to have disputed,

in his extreme old age, with one of the foreign mis­

sionaries, and the dispute is still extant, in verse,

and in the Erse language. See Mr. Macpherson's

Dissertation on the Antiquity of Offian's Poems,

p. 10.

[178] The Goths, who ravaged Asia in the reign

of Gallienus, carried away great numbers of cap­

tives; some of whom were Christians, and beerme

missionaries. See Tillemont, Mcmoires Ecclesiast.

torn. iv. p. 44.

[179] The Legend of Abgarus, fabulous as it is,

affords a decisive proof, that many years before Eu-

febius wrote hit history, the greatest part of the in­

habitants of Edessa had embraced Christianity.

Their rivals, the citizens of Carrhæ adhered, on the

contrary, to the cause of Paganism, as late as the

sixth century.

[180] According to Bardesanes (»p. Euscb. Praj.

par. Evangel.) there were some Christians in Persia

before the end of the second century. In the time

ofConstantine (see his Epistle to Sapor. Vit. 1. iv.

c. 13.) they composed a flourishing church. Con­

[184] The story is prettily told in Justin's Dai-

334.), who relates it after him, is sure that the old

man was a disguised angel. {

[185] Eusebius, v. 28. It may be hoped, that

none, except the heretics, gave occasion to the com­

plaint of Celsus (ap. Origen, 1 ii. fp. 77.), that the

Christians were perpetually correcting and altering

their Gospels.
