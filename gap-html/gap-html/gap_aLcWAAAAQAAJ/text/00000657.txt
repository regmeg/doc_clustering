NOTES ON THE TENTH CHAPTER. xxxvii

'. conversion of Prussia were completed by those ad­

venturers in the xiiith century.

[17] Pliny (Hist. Natur. iv. 14.), and Procopius

(in Bell. Vandal. 1. i. c. 1.) agree in this opinion.

They lived in distant ages, and possessed different

means of investigating the truth.

[18] The Ojlro and Visi, the eastern and western

Goths obtained those denominations from their

original feats in Scandinavia. In all their future

marches and settlements they preserved, with their

names, the fame relative situation. When they

first departed from Sweden, the infant colony was

contained in three'vessels. The third being a

heavy sailor lagged behind, and the crew, which

afterwards swelled into a nation, received from

that circumstance the appellation of Gepidæ or

Loiterers. Jornandes, c. 17*

Excerpta Legationum, and with regard to its

probable date, fee Tillemont, Hist, des Empe-

reurs, torn. iii. p. 346.

acquired their Iron by the commerce of amber.

[21] Jornandes, c. 13: 14.

[22] The Heruli, and the Uregundi or Bur-

gundi, are particularly mentioned. See Mascou's

History of the Germans, 1. v. A passage in the

Augustan History, p. 28, seems to allude to this

great emigration. The Marcomannic war was

partly occasioned by the pressure of barbarous

tribes, who fled before the arms of more northern

barbarians.

third part of his incomparable map of Europe.

[26] TheVenedi, the Slavi, and the Antes, were

the three great tribes of the fame people. Jor­

nandes, c. 24.

[27] Tacitus most assuredly deserves that title,

and even his cautious suspense is a proof, of his,

diligent inquiries.

Mr. Bell (vol. ii. p. 379.) traversed the Ukraine in

-his journey from Peterlburgh to Constantinople.  
1 he modern, face of the country is a just represent­

ation of the ancient, since, in the hands of the

Cossacks, it still remains in a state of nature.

[29] In the sixteenth chapter of Jornandes, in­

stead of stcundo Mcesiam, we may venture to sub­

stitute secundam, the second Mjesia, of which Mar-

cianopolis was certainly the capital (fee Hierocle*

de Provinuis, and Wesseling ad locum, p. 636

Itinera). It is surprising how this palpable error

of the scribe could escape the judicious correction

of Grotius.

[30] The place is still called N icop. The little

stream, on whose banks it flood, falls into the Da­

nube. Danville Geographie Ancienne, torn. i.

[3;] Claudius (who afterwards reigned with so'

much glory) was posted in the pass of Thermopylæ

with 200 Dardanians, i-oo heavy and 160 light

horse, 60' Cretan archers, and 1000 well armed,

recruits. See an original letter from the emperor

to his officer in the Augustan History, p. 200.

In the general account of this war, it is easy to dis­

cover the opposite prejudices of the Gothic and the

Grecian writer. In carelessness alone they are alike.

[38] Vespasian and Titus were the last censors

(Pliny Hist. Natur. vii. tg. Censorinus de Die

Natali). The modesty of Trajan refused an honour

which he deserved, and his example was a law to

the Antonines. See Pliny's Panegyric, c. 45 and 60.
