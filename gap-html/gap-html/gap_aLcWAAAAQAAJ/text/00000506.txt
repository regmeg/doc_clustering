74 THE DECLINE AND FALL

fused a spirit of bitterness into a system of love and harmony. The

ties of blood and friendship were frequently torn asunder by the

difference of religious faith; and the Christians, who, in this world,

found themselves oppressed by the power of the pagans, were some­

times seduced by resentment and spiritual pride to delight in the

prospect of their future triumph. "You are fond of spectacles,"

exclaims the stern Tertullian ; "expect the greatest of all spectacles,

"the last and eternal judgment of the universe* How shall I ad-

"mire, how laugh, how rejoice, how exult, when I behold so

"many proud monarchs, and fancied gods, groaning in the lowest

"abyss of darkness; so many magistrates who persecuted the name

"of the Lord, liquefying in fiercer fires than they ever kindled

"against the. Christians; so many sage philosophers blushing in red

*' hot flames with their deluded scholars; so many celebrated poets  
"trembling before the tribunal, not of Minos, but of Christ; so

"many tragedians, more tuneful in the expression of their own

"sufferings; so many dancers"—But the humanity of the reader

will permit me to draw a veil over the rest of this infernal descrip­

tion, which the zealous African pursues in a long variety of affected

theiTfws.by temper more suitable to the meekness and charity of their
profession.

There were many who felt a sincere compassion for the danger of

their friends and countrymen, and who exerted the most benevolent

zeal to save them from the impending destruction. The careless

Polytheist, assailed by new and unexpected terrors, against which

neither his priests nor his philosophers could afford him any cer­

tain protection, was very frequently terrified and subdued by the

menace of eternal tortures. His fears might assist the progress of

his faith and reason; and if he could once persuade himself to suspect

that the Christian religion might possibly be true, it became an easy

talk
