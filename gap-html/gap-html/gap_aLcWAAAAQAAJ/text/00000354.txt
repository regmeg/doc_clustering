ExtTaordinrry Q< U C H was the Unhappy condition of the Roman emperors*,

tweenthe kD that whatever might be their conduct, their fate was corn-

senate for the monly the same. A life of pleasure Or virtue, o£ severity or
milcf-

¥mperor[an ne^"S» °^ indolence or glory, alike led to an untimely grave; and

almost every reign is closed by the same disgusting repetition of

treason and murder. The death of Aurelian,, however, is remark­

lamented, and revenged, their victorious chief. The artifice of

his perfidious secretary was discovered and ptinifhed. The deluded

conspirators attended the funeral of their injured sovereign, with

sincere or well feigned contrition, and submitted to the unanimous

resolution of the military order, which was signified by the follow­

"people of Rome. The crime of one man, and the error of many,.

84 gods, and to appoint a successor whom your judgment fliall deelape

"misfortune have contributed to our lose, shall ever reign over

emperor had been assassinated in his camp: they secretly rejoiced in

the fall of Aurelian; but the modest and dutiful address of the

legions, when it was communicated in full assembly by the consul,

diffused the most pleasing astonishment. Such honours, as fear and

perhaps esteem could extort, they liberally poured forth on the
