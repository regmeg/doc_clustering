THE DECLINE AND FALL

/

riches; and the appearance of the arms of the Germans, furnished

a sufficient proof how little iron the): were able to bestow on what

they must have deemed the noblest use of that metal. The various

transactions of peace and war, had introduced some Roman coins

(chiefly silver) among the borderers of the Rhine and Danube;

but the more distant tribes were absolutely unacquainted with the

use of money, carried on their confined traffic by the exchange of

commodities, and prized their rude earthen vessels as of equal value

with the silver vases, the presents of Rome to their princes and am-

bastadors **. To a mind capable of reflection, such leading facts

convey more instruction, than a tedious detail of subordinate circum­

stances. The value of money has been settled by general consent

to express our wants and our property; as letters were invented

active energy to the powers and passions of human nature, have

contributed to muhiply the objects they were designed to represent.

The use of gold and silver is in a great measure factitious; but it

would be impossible-to enumerate the important and various services

which agriculture, and all the arts, have received from iron, when

tempered and fashioned by the operation of fire, and the dexterous

hand of man. Money, in a word, is the most universal incitement,

iron the most powerful instrument of human industry; and it is

very difficult to conceive by what means a people, neither actuated

by the one, nor seconded by the other, could emerge from the grossest

barbarism *'.

If we contemplate a savage nation in any part of the globe, a

supine indolence and a carelessness of futurity will be found to con­

stitute their general character. In a civilized state, every faculty

of man is expanded and exercised; and the great chain of mutual

dependence connects and embraces the several members of society.

The most numerous portion of it is employed in constant and useful

labour. The select few, placed by fortune above that necessity,

can,
