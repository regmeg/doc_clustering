NOTES ON THE FOURTH CHAPTER.

[1] £EE the complaints of Avidius Caflius, Hist.

O August, p. 4;. These are, it is true, the

complaints of faction; but even faction exaggerates,

rather than invents.

diiior.es sibi et nauticas et gladiatorias elegisse.

of merit which Faustina chose, and the conditions

which she exacted. Hist. August, p. icz.

[4] Meditat. 1. i. The world has laughed at the

credulity of Marcus; but Madam Dacier assures

us (and we may credit a lady), that the husband will

always be deceived, if the wife condescends to dis­

semble.

[5] Dion Caflius, 1. lxxi. p. 119;. Hist. August,

p. 33. Commentaire de Spanheim fur les Ctsars

de.Julien, p. 289. The deification of Faustina is

the only defect which Julian's criticism is able to

discover in the all-accomplislicd character of

Marcus.

[6] Commodus was the first Porphyrogenetut

(born since his father's accession to the throne). By

a new strain of flattery, the Egyptian medals date

by the years of his life; as if they were synony­

mous to those of his reign. Tillement. Hist, des

Empereurs, torn. ii. p. 752.

[9] According to Tertullian (Apolog. c. 25.) he

died at Sirmium. Bat the situation of Vindobona

or Vienna, where both the Victors place his death,

is better adapted to the operations of the war against

the Marcomanni and Quadi.

the medals as well as historians.) by Mr. Wotton.

[13] Manilius the confidential secretary of Avi-

dios Caflius was discovered after he had lain con­

cealed several years. The emperor nobly relieved

the public anxiety by refusing to see him, and

burning his papers without opening them. Dio

[16] In a note upon the Augustan History, Ca-

saubon has collected a number of particulars con­

cerning these celebrated brothers. See p. 96 of his

learned commentary.

[17] Dio, 1. lxxii. p. 1210. Herodian, 1. i. p. 22.

Hist. August, p. 48. Dion gives a much less odious

character of Perennis, than the other historians.

His moderation is almost a pledge of his veracity.

[iS] During the second Punic war, the Romans

imported from Asia the worship of the mother of

the gods. Her festival, the Mtgalefia, began on the

fourth of April, and lasted six days. The streets

were crowded with mad processions, the theatres

with spectators; and the public tables with un­

bidden guests. Order and police were suspended,

and pleasure was the only serious business of the

city. See Ovid de Fastis, 1. iv. 189, &c.

[2 1] One of these dear-bought promotions occa­

sioned a current bon root, that Julius Solon was

banijhid into the senate.

[22] Dio (1. lxxii. p. 12, 13.) observes, that no

freedman had possessed riches equal to those of

Cleander. The fortune of Pallas amounted, how­
