THE DECLINE AND FALL

a great number of spectators; the patient was relieved by the power

or (kill of the exorcist, and the vanquished dæmon was heard to

confess, that he was one of the fabled gods of antiquity, who had

impiously usurped the adoration of mankind 7\ But the miracu­

lous cure of diseases of the most inveterate or even preternatural

kind, can no longer occasion any surprise, when we recollect, that

in the days of Irenæus, about the end of the second century, the

resurrection of the dead was very far from being esteemed an un­

common event; that the miracle was frequently performed on neces­

sary occasions, by great fasting and the joint supplication of the

church of the place, and that the persons thus restored to their

prayers, had lived afterwards among them many years "i. At such

a period, when faith could boast of so many wonderful victories

over death, it seems difficult to account for the scepticism of those

philosophers, who still rejected and derided the doctrine of the re­

surrection. A noble Grecian had rested on this important ground

the whole controversy, and promised Theophilus, bishop of Antiochj

that if he could be gratified with the sight of a single person who

had been actually raised from the dead, he would immediately em­

brace the Christian religion. It is somewhat remarkable, that the

prelate of the first eastern church, however anxious for the con­

version of his friend, thought proper to decline this fair and rea­

sonable challenge ~6.

The miracles of the primitive church, after obtaining the sanc­

tion of ages, have been lately attacked in a very free and in­

favourable reception from the Public, appears to have excited a

general scandal among the divines of our own as well as of the

other protestant churches of Europe7*. Our different sentiments of

this controversy will be much less influenced by any particular argu­

ments, than by our habits of study and reflection; and above all, by

the degree of the evidence which we have accustomed ourselves to re­

quire
