sects enrolled themselves under the banners of the more fashionable

teachers, who recommended their system by a new method, and by

their manners. Several of these masters, Ammonius, Plotinus, Ame-

lius, and Porphyry were men of profound thoughtand intense ap­

plication; but by mistaking the true object of philosophy, their la­

bours contributed much less- to improve than to corrupt the human

understanding. The knowledge that is suited to our situation and

powers, the whole compass of moral, natural, and mathematical science,

was neglected by thtf new Platonicians; whilst they exhausted their

strength in the verbal disputes of metaphysics, attempted to explore

the secrets of the invisible world, and studied to reconcile Aristotle

with Plato, on subjects of which both these philosophers were as

ignorant as the rest of mankind. Consuming their reason in these

deep but unsubstantial meditations, their minds were exposed to

illusions of fancy. They flattered themselves that they possessed the

secreb of disengaging the soul from its corporeal prison; claimed a

familiar intercourse with dæmons and spirits, and, by a very singular

revolution, converted the study of philosophy into that of magic.

The ancient sages had derided the popular superstition j after dis­

guising its extravagance by the thin pretence of allegory, the dis­

ciples of Plotinus and Porphyry became its most zealous defenders.

As they agreed with the Christians in a few mysterious points of

faith, they attacked the remainder of their theological system with

all the fury of civil war. The new Platonicians would scarcely de­

serve a place in the history of science, but in that of the church the

mention of them will very frequently occur.
