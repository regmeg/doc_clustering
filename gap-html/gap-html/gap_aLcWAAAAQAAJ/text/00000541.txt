OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 509

clas ,6\ The body of the natives, a people distinguished by a sullen

inflexibility of temper ,6', entertained the new doctrine with cold­

in favour of the sacred animals of his country ,s*. As soon, indeed,

as Christianity ascended the throne, the zeal of those barbarians

obeyed the prevailing impulsion; the cities of Egypt were filled

with bishops, and the deserts of Thebais swarmed with hermits.

A perpetual stream of strangers and provincials flowed into the In Rome;
