THE DECLINE AND FALL

changed the language of exhortation into that of command, scattered

the seeds of future usurpations, and supplied by scripture allegories

and declamatory rhetoric, their deficiency of force and of reason.

They exalted the unity and power of the church, as it was repre­

sented in the episcopal office, of which every bishop enjoyed

an equal and undivided portion Princes and magistrates, it was

often repeated, might boast an earthly claim to a transitory domi­

nion. It was the episcopal authority alone which was derived from

the deity, and extended itself over this and over another world.

The bishops were the vicegerents of Christ, the successors of the

apostles, and the mystic substitutes of the high priest of the Mosaic

law. Their exclusive privilege of conferring the sacerdotal charac­

ter, invaded the freedom both of clerical and of popular elections;

and if, in the administration of the church, they sometimes con­

sulted the judgment of the presbyters, or the inclination of the

people, they most carefully inculcated the merit of such a voluntary

condescension. The bishops acknowledged the supreme authority

which resided in the assembly of their brethren; but in she govern­

ment of his peculiar diocese, each of them exacted from his Jlock

the fame implicit obedience as if that favourite metaphor had been

literally just, and as if the shepherd had been of a more exalted

nature than that of his sheep"6. This obedience, however, wa»

not imposed without some efforts on one side, and some resistance

on the other. The democratical part of the constitution was, in

many places, very warmly supported by the zealous or interested

opposition of the inferior clergy. But their'patriotism received the

ignominious epithets of faction and schism; and the episcopal cause

Was indebted for its rapid progress to the labours of many active

prelates, who, like Cyprian of Carthage, could reconcile the arts of

the most ambitious statesman with the christian virtues which seerr*

adapted to the character of a faint and. martyr "\
