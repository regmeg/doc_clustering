OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

gustus to the senate, in which that experienced prince so accurately

balanced the revenues and expences of the Roman empire Ss. De­

prived of this clear and comprehensive estimate, we are reduced to

collect a few imperfect hints from such of the ancients as have acci­

dentally turned aside from the splendid to the more useful parts of

history. We are informed, that by the conquests of Pompey, the

tributes of Asia were raised from fifty to one hundred and thirty- of Ada,

five millions of drachms; or about four millions and a half ster­

ling 8S. Under the last and most indolent of the Ptolemies, the re- of Egypt,

venue of Egypt is said to have amounted to twelve thousand five

hundred talents; a sum far inferior to what was afterwards pro­

duced by the more exact ceconomy of the Romans, and the increase

of the trade of Æthiopia and India "7. Gaul was enriched by rapine, of Gaul,

as Egypt was by commerce, and the tributes of those two great pro­

vinces have been compared as nearly equal to each other in value

The ten thousand Euboic or Phœnician talents, about four millions of Africa,

sterling which vanquished Carthage was condemned to pay within

the term of fifty years, were a flight acknowledgment of the supe­

riority of Rome 9°, and cannot bear the least proportion with the

taxes afterwards raised both on the lands and on the persons of the

inhabitants, when the fertile coast of Africa was reduced into a

province

Spain, by a very singular fatality, was the Peru and Mexico of of Spain,

the old world. The discovery of the rich western continent by the

Phœnicians, and the oppression of the simple natives, who were

compelled to labour in their own mines for the benefit of strangers,

form an exact type of the more recent history of Spanish America 9\

The Phœnicians were acquainted only with the sea-coast of Spain;

avarice, as well as ambition, carried the arms of Rome and Carthage

into the heart of the country, and almost every part of the soil was

found pregnant with copper, silver, and gold. Mention is made of a

mine near Carthagena which yielded every day twenty-five thousand
