THE DECLINE, AND FALL

With regard to the treatment of these penitents two opposite

©pinions, the one of justice, the other of mercy, divided the primitive

church. The more rigid and inflexible casuists refused them for

ever, and without exception, the meanest place in the holy com­

munity, which they had disgraced or deserted, and leaving them to

the remorse of a guilty conscience, indulged them only with a faint

ray of hope, that the contrition of their life and death might

possibly be accepted by the Supreme Being A milder sentiment

was embraced in practice as well as in theory, by the purest and

most respectable of the Christian churches ,+\ The gates of re­

conciliation and of Heaven were seldom shut against the returning

penitent; but a severe and. solemn form of discipline was instituted,

which, while it served to expiate his crime, might powerfully

whole years of penance were esteemed an inadequate satisfaction lo

the Divine Justice; and it was always, by flow and painful grar

communication was, however, reserved for some crimes , of an

extraordinary magnitude, and particularly for the inexcusable re­

lapses of those penitents who had already experienced and abused

the clemency of their ecclesiastical superiors. According to the

circumstances or the number of the guilty, the exercise of the

Christian discipline was varied by the discretion of the bishops*

The councils of Ancyra and Illiberis were held about the fame time,

the one in Galatia, the other in Spain; but their respective canons,

which are still extant, seem to breathe a very different spirit. The
