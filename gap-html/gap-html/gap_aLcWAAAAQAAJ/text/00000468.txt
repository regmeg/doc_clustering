THE DECLINE AND FALL

conquerors, fatigued with civil war, and connected by a private as

well as public alliance, would have renounced, or at least have sus­

pended, any farther designs of ambition. And yet a year had

scarcely elapsed after the death of Maximin, before the victorious

emperors turned their arms against each other. The genius, the

success, and the aspiring temper, of Constantine, may seem to mark

him out as the aggressor; but the perfidious character of Licinius

justifies the most unfavourable suspicions, and by the faint light

which history reflects on this transaction 86, we may discover a

conspiracy fomented by his arts against the authority of his col­

league. Constantine had lately given his sister Anastasia in mar­

riage to Bassianus, a man of a considerable family and fortune, and

had elevated his new kinsman to the rank of Cæsar. According to

the system of government instituted by Diocletian, Italy, and per­

haps Africa, were designed for his department in the empire.

But the performance of the promised favour was either attended

with so much delay, or accompanied with so many unequal con­

ditions, that the fidelity of Bassianus was alienated rather than

secured by the honourable distinction which he had obtained. His

nomination had been ratified by the consent of Licinius, and that

artful prince, by the means of his emissaries, soon contrived to

enter into a secret and dangerous correspondence with the new

Cæsar, to irritate his discontents, and to urge him to the rash

enterprise of extorting by violence what he might in vain solicit

from the justice of Constantine. But the vigilant emperor dis­

covered the conspiracy before it was ripe for execution; and, after

solemnly renouncing the alliance of Bassianus, despoiled him of the

purple, and inflicted the deserved punishment on his treason and

ingratitude. The haughty refusal of Licinius, when he was required to

deliver up the criminals, who had taken refuge in his dominions,

confirmed the suspicions already entertained of his perfidy; and the

indignities offered at Æmona, on the frontiers of Italy, to the
