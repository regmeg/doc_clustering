THE DECLINE AND FALL

to appear in his private council-chamber. He there acquainted him

with the Imperial mandate which he had just received 8o, that those

who had abandoned the Roman religion should immediately return

to the practice of the ceremonies of their ancestors. Cyprian replied

without hesitation, that he was a Christian and a bishop, devoted to

the worship of the true and only Deity, to whom he offered up his

daily supplications for the safety and prosperity of the two emperors,

his lawful sovereigns. With modest confidence he pleaded the pri­

first victims; and the frailty of nature tempted him to withdraw

himself, by a secret flight, from the danger and the honour of

martyrdom: but soon recovering that fortitude which his character

required, he returned to his gardens, and patiently expected the
