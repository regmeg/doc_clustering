NOTES ON THE SIXTEENTH CHAPTER.

tions of a nocturnal crowd. Act Proconsularia,

C. 2.

[8*] See the original sentence in the Acts, c. 4,

and in Pontius, c. 17. The latter expresses it in a

more rhetorical manner.

[87] Pontius, c. 19. M. de Tillemont (Memoires,

tom. iv. part i. p. 450. note cc) is not pleased

with so positive an exclusion of any former martyrs

of the episcopal rank.

[88] Whatever opinion we may entertain os the

character or principles of Thomas Becket, we must

acknowledge that he suffered death, with a con­

stancy not unworthy of the primitive martyrs. See

Lord Lyttehon's History of Henry II. vol. ii. p.

59*, &c

[So] See in particular the treatise of Cyprian de

Lapsis, p. 87—98. Edit. Fell. The learning of

Dodwell (Dissertat. Cyprianic. xii. xiii.), and the

ingenuity of Middleton (Free Enquiry, p. 162, &c),

have left scarcely any thing to add concerning the

merit, the honours, and the motives of the martyrs.

[90] Cyprian Epistol. ;, 6, 7. 22. 24, and de

Unitat. Ecclesiæ. The number of pretended mar­

tyrs has been very much multiplied, by the custom

which was introduced of bestowing that honourable

name on confessors.

[91] Certatim gloriosa in certamina ruebatur;

multique avidius turn martyri.i gloriosis mortibus

quærebantur, quam nunc Episeopatus pravis ambi-

onibus appetuntur. Sulpicius Severus, 1. ii. He

might have omitted the word nunc.

[02] See Epist. ad Roman, c. 4, e. ap. Patres

Apostol. tom. ii. p. 27. It suited the purpose of

Eilhop Pearson (see Vindiciæ Ignatianæ, part ii.

c. 9.) to justify by a profusion of examples and au­

thorities, the sentiments of Ignatius.

[93] The story of Polyeuctes, on which Corneilfe

has founded a very beautiful tragedy, is one of the

most celebrated, though not perhaps the most au­

thentic instances of this excessive zeal. We should

observe, that the 60th canon of the council of IHi-

beris refuse* the title of martyrs to those who ex­

posed themselves to death, by publicly destroying

the idols.

[94] See Epictetus, 1. iv. c. 7. (though there is

some doubt whether he alludes to the christian.)

Marcus Antoninus de Rebus suis, 1. xi. c. 3. Lu-

cian in Peregrin.

[95] Tertnllian ad Scapul. c. 5. The learned

are divided between three persons of the fame

name, who were all proconsuls of Asia. I am

inclined to ascribe this story to Antoninus Pius,

who was afterwards emperor; and who may have

governed Asia, under the reign of Trajan.

[96] Mostieim, de Rebus Christ, ante Constan-

tin. p. 235.

[97] See the Epistle of the Church of Smyrna,

ap. Eufeb. Hist. Eccles. 1. iv. c. 1 j.

[98] In the second apology of Justin, there is a

particular and very curious instance of this legal

delay. The fame indulgence was granted to accused

christians, in the persecution of Decius; and Cy­

prian (de Lapsis) expresly mentions the "Dies ne>

gantibus præstitutus."

[99] Tertullian considers flight from persecution,

as an imperfect, but very criminal apostacy, as an

impious attempt to elude the will of God, &c. &c.

He has written a treatise on this subject (see p. 536

—C44. Edit. Rigalt.), which is filled with the

wildest fanaticism, and the most incoherent decla­

mation. It is however somewhat remarkable, that

Tertullian did not suffer martyrdom himself.

[ 100] ThxLibellatici, who are chiefly known by the

writings of Cyprian, are described with the utmost

precision, in the copious commentary of Mosheim,

p. 483—489,

[101] Plin. Epistol. x. 97. Dionysius Alexaa-

drin. ap. Eufeb. 1. vi. c. 41. Ad prima slatim

verba minantis inimici maximus fratrum numerus

sidem suam prodidit: nec prostratus est persecuti-

onis impetu, fed voluntario lapfu seipsum prostra-

vit. Cyprian. Opera, p. 89. Among these de­

serters were many priests, and even bishops.

[101] It was on this occasion that Cyprian wrote

his treatise De Lapsis and many of his epistles. The

controversy concerning rhe treatment of peniteat

apostates, does not occur among the Christians of

the preceding century. Shall we ascribe this to the

superiority of their faith and courage, or to onr less

intimate knowledge of their history?
