THE DECLINE AND FALL

situation of the prisoners, he frequently condescended to set before

their eyes every circumstance which could render life more pleasing,

or death more terrible; and to solicit, nay to intreat, them, that

they would shew some compassion to themselves, to their families,

and to their friends 6*. If threats and persuasions proved in­

effectual, he had often recourse to violence; the scourge and the

rack were called in to supply the deficiency of argument, and every

art of cruelty was employed to subdue such inflexible, and as it

appeared to the Pagans, such criminal, obstinacy. The ancient

apologists of Christianity have censured, with equal truth and

severity, the irregular conduct of their persecutors, who, contrary

to every principle of judicial proceeding, admitted the use of torture,

in order to obtain, not a confession, but a denial, of the crime which

was the object of their inquiry 6|. The monks of succeeding ages,

who, in their peaceful solitudes, entertained themselves with di­

versifying the deaths and sufferings of the primitive martyrs, have

frequently invented torments of a much more refined and ingenious

nature. In particular, it has pleased them to suppose, that the

zeal of the Roman magistrates, disdaining every consideration of

moral virtue or public decency, endeavoured to seduce those whom

they were unable to vanquish, and that by their orders the most brutal

violence was offered to those whom they found it impossible to seduce.

It is related, that pious females, who were prepared to despise death,

were sometimes condemned to a more severe trial, and called upon to de­

termine whether they set a higher value on their religion or on their

chastity. The youths to whose licentious embraces they were aban­

doned, received a solemn exhortation from the judge, to exert their

most strenuous efforts to maintain the honour of Venus against the im­

pious virgin who refused to burn incense on her altars. Their

violence however was commonly disappointed, and the seasonable

interposition of some miraculous power preserved the chaste spouses

of Christ from the diflionour even of an involuntary defeat. We
