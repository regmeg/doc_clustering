384 THE DECLINE AND FALL

motives, was justified by very specious considerations of policy.

Jencelr ^ne court of the emperor of the West was, for the most part,

Milan established at Milan, whose situation, at the foot of the Alps, ap­

peared far more convenient than that of Rome, for the important

purpose of watching the motions of the barbarians of Germany.

Milan soon assumed the splendour of an imperial city. The houses

are described as numerous and well built; the manners of the

people as polished and liberal. A circus, a theatre, a mint, a palace,

baths, which bore the name of their founder Maximian j porticos

adorned with statues, and a double circumference of walls, con­

tributed to the beauty of the new capital; nor did it seem op­

pressed even by the proximity of Rome 9°. To rival the majesty

d^NiCOmC" °f Rome was the ambition likewise of Diocletian, who employed

his leisure, and the wealth of the East, in the embellishment of

Nicomedia, a city placed on the verge of Europe and Asia, almost

at an equal distance between the Danube and the Euphrates. By

the taste of the monarch, and at the expence of the people, Ni-

•comedia acquired, in the space of a few years, a degree of magnificence

which might appear to have required the labour of ages, and became

inferior only to Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch, in extent or populous-

ness 9% The life of Diocletian and Maximian was a life of action, and

a considerable portion of it was spent in camps, or in their long and

•frequent marches ; but whenever the public business allowed them any

relaxation, they seem to have retired with pleasure to their favourite re­

sidences of Nicomedia and Milan. Till Diocletian, in the twentieth

year ef his reign, celebrated his Roman triumph, it is extremely

doubtful whether he ever visited the ancient capital of the empire.

Even on that memorable occasion his stay did not exceed two

months. Disgusted with the licentious familiarity of the people,

he quitted Rome with precipitation thirteen days before it was

expected that he should have appeared in tbe senate, invested with

the ensigns of the consular dignity 9\
