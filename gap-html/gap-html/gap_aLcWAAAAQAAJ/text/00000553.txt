OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

It plight therefore be expected, that they would unite with just

indignation against any sect or people which should separate itself

from the communion of mankind, and claiming the exclusive pos­

session of divine knowledge, should disdain, as impious and idola­

trous, every form of worshipbut its own. The rights of toleration

were held by mutual indulgence: they were naturally forfeited by

ported by the opinion, that it was unlawful for them to pay taxes

to an idolatrous master; and by the flattering promise which they

derived from their ancient oracles, that a conquering Messiah would

soon arise, destined to break their fetters, and to invest the favourites
