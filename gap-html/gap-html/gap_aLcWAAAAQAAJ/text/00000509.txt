the difficulty of adopting such a theory as may reconcile the interest

of religion with that of reason, of making a proper application of

that theory, and of defining with precision the limits of that happy

period exempt from error and from deceit, to which we might be

disposed to allow the gift of supernatural powers. From the first of

the fathers to the last of the popes, a succession of bishops, of

saints, of martyrs, and of miracles, is continued without interrup­

tion, and the progress of superstition was so gradual and almost

imperceptible, that we know not in what particular link we should

break the chain of tradition. Every age bears testimony to the

wonderful events by which it was distinguished, and its testimony

appears no less weighty and respectable than that of the preceding

generation, till we are insensibly led on to accuse our own incon­

sistency, if in the eighth or in the twelfth century we deny to the

venerable Bede, or to the holy Bernard, the same degree of con­

fidence which in the second century we had so liberally granted to

Justin or to Irenæus 79. If the truth of any of those miracles is

appreciated by their apparent use and propriety, every age had un­

believers to convince, heretics to confute, and idolatrous nations

to convert; and sufficient motives might always be produced to

justify the interposition of Heaven. And yet since every friend to

revelation is persuaded of the reality, and every reasonable man is

convinced of the cessation of miraculous powers, it is evident that

there must have been some period in which they were either sud­

denly or gradually withdrawn from the Christian church. What­

ever æra is chosen for that purpose, the death of the apostles, the

conversion of the Roman empire, or the extinction of the Arian

heresy 8o, the insensibility of the Christians who lived at that time

will equally afford a just matter of surprise. They still supported
