THE DECLINE AND FALL

states, who, during the long slumber of his predecessors, had insulted

Perfia with impunity. He obtained some easy victories over the

wild Scythians and the effeminate Indians j but the Romans were

an enemy, who, by their past injuries and present power, deserved

the utmost efforts of his arms. A forty years tranquillity, the

fruit of valour and moderation, had succeeded the victories of Trajan.
