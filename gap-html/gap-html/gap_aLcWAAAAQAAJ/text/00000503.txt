prophecy and revelation; but as long as, for wise purposes, this error

was permitted to subsist in the church, it was productive of the most

salutary effects on the faith and practice of Christians, who lived

in the awful expectation of that moment when the globe itself, and

all the various race of mankind, should tremble at the appearance

of their divine judge

The ancient and popular doctrine of the Millennium was inti* Doctrine of

mately connected with the second coming of Christ. As the works n;'^'1

of the creation had been finished in six days, their duration in their

present state, according to a tradition which was attributed to the

prophet Elijah, was fixed to fix thousand years6o. By the fame"

analogy it was inferred, that this long period of labour and con­

tention, which was now almost elapsed 6\ would be succeeded by a

joyful Sabbath of a thousand years; and that Christ, with the tri­

umphant band of the saints and the elect who had escaped death, or

who had been miraculously revived, would reign upon earth till the

time appointed for the last and general resurrection. So pleasing

prevailed under the Roman empire. A city Was therefore erected

of gold and precious stones-, and a supernatural plenty of corn and

Wine was bestowed on the adjacent territory; in the free enjoyment

of whose spontaneous productions, the happy and benevolent peo­

ple was never to be restrained by any jealous laws of exclusive

property6*. The assurance of such a Millennium, was carefully irt»-

culcated by a succession of the fathers from Justin Martyr and

Irenæus, who conversed with the immediate disciples of the apostles*
