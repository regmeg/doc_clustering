[26] Tuncque primum tres pnefecti prætorio

fuere: inter quos libertinus. From some remains

of modesty, Cleander declined the title, whilst he

assumed the powers,, of Prætorian Præfect. As the

other freedmen were styled, from their several de­

partments a rationibni, ab epistolis; Cleander

called himself a pugione, as intrusted with the de­

fence of his master's person. Salmasius and Cafau-

bon seem to have talked very idly upon this passage.

prætorian infantry, or the cohortes urbanæ, a body

of six thousand men, but whose rank and discipline

were not equal to their numbers. Neither Tille-

ment nor Wotton. chuse to decide this question.

[30] The African lions, when pressed by hun­

ger, infested the open villages and cultivated,

country; and they infested them with impunity.

The Royal beast was reserved for the pleasures of the

emperor and the capital; and the unfortunate

peasant, who killed one of them, though in his own-

defence, incurred a very heavy penalty. This

extraordinary game law was mitigated by Honorius,

and finally repealed by Justinian. Theodof. torn,

[34] Commodus killed a camelopardalis or

Giraffe, (Dio, 1 Ixxii. p. iati.) the tallest, the most

gentle, and the most useless of the large qusdrtr-

peds. This singular animal, a native only of the

interior parts of Africa, has not been seen in Eu­

rope since the revival of letters, and though M.

de Buffon (Hist. Naturelle, torn, jtiii ) has endear

voured to describe, he has not ventured to delineate,

the Giraffe.

what was more dreaded by those profligate wrttchesj

of exile. The tyrants allured them to dishonour

by threats and rewards. Nero once produced, in

the Arena, forty senators and sixty knights. Lip-

his antagonists a leaden weapon, dreading most pro­

bably the consequences cf their despair.

[42] He mixed however some prudence with his-

courage, and passed the greatest part of his time in a

country retirement; alleging his advanced age,

and the weakness of his eyes. "1 never saw him
