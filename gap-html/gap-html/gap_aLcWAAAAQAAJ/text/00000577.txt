.OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, 54S

should not indeed neglect to remark, that the more ancient as welj

as authentic memorials of the church are seldom polluted with

these extravagant and indecent fictions 6*.

The total disregard of truth and probability in the representation Jjjg"^^ of

of these primitive martyrdoms was occasioned by a very natural magistrates,

mistake. The ecclesiastical writers of the fourth or fifth centuries

ascribed to the magistrates of Rome the fame degree of implacable

and unrelenting zeal which silled their own breasts against the

heretics or the idolaters of their own times. It is not improbable

that some of those persons who were raised to the dignities of the

empire, might have imbibed the prejudices of the populace,

and that the cruel disposition of others might occasionally be

stimulated by motives of avarice or of personal resentment 6s.

But it is certain, and we may appeal to the grateful confections of

the first Christians, that the greatest part of those magistrates who

exercised in the provinces the authority of the emperor, or of the

senate, and to whose hands alone the jurisdiction of life and death

was intrusted, behaved like men of polished manners and liberal

educations, who respected the rules of justice, and who were conver_

fant with the precepts of philosophy. They frequently declined the

odious task of persecution, dismissed the charge with contempt*

or suggested to the accused Christian some legal evasion, by which

he might elude the severity of the laws 66. Whenever they were

invested with a discretionary power 6% they used it much less for

the oppression, than for the relief and benefit of the afflicted church-

They were far from condemning all the Christians who were acÂ­

cused before their tribunal, and very far from punishing with death

all those who were convicted of an obstinate adherence to the new

superstition. Contenting themselves, for the most part, with the

milder chastisements of imprisonment, exile, or slavery in the

mines 6\ they left the unhappy victims of their justice some reason to

hope, that a prosperous event, the accession, the marriage, or the
