NOTES ON THE FIFTH CHAPTER. xix

{43] Herodian, 1. ii. p. 85.

[44] While Severus was very dangerously ill, it

was industriously given out, that he intended to ap­

point Niger and Albinus his successors. As he

could not be sincere with respect to both, he might

not be so with regard to either. Yet Severus

carried his hypocrisy so far, as to profess that in­

tention in the memoirs of his own life.

[46] This practice, invented by Commodus,

proved very useful to Severus. He found, at Rome,

the children of many of the principal adherents of

his rivals; and he employed (hem more than once

to intimidate, or seduce the parents.

[$3] Most of these, as may be supposed, were

small open vessels, some, however, were gallies of

two, and a few of three ranks of oars.

[54] The engineer's name was Priscus. His

skill saved his life, and he was taken into the service

cf the conqueror. For the particular facts of the

siege, consult Dion Cassius, (1. lxxv. p. 1251) and

Herodian (1. iii. p. 9;.): for the theory of it, the

fanciful chevalier de Folard may be looked into. See

Polybe, torn. i. p. 76.

[55] Notwithstanding the authority of Sparti­

anus and some modern Greeks, we may be assured,

from Dion and Herodian, that Byzantium, many

years after the death of Severus, lay in ruins.

[56] Dion, 1. lxxiv. p. 1250.

[57] Dion (1. lxxv. p. 1264.) only 29 senators are

mentioned by him, but 41 are named in the Augus­

tan History, p. 69. among whom were six of the

name of Pescennius. Herodian (1. iii. p. 115.)

speaks in general of the cruelties of Severus.

Severus celebrated the secular games with extra­

ordinary magnificence, and he left in the public

granaries a provision of corn for seven years, at the

rateof75,oco modii, or about 2500 quarters per

day. I am persuaded, that the granaries of Severus

were supplied for a long term, but I am not less

persuaded, that policy on one hand, and admiration

on the other, magnified the hoard far beyond its

true contents,

[60] See Spanheim's treatise of ancient medals,

the inscriptions, and our learned travellers Spon

and Wheeler, Shaw, Pocock, &c. who, in Africa,

Greece, and Asia, have found more monuments of

Severus, than of any other Roman emperor what*

soever.

[61] He carried his victorious arms to Seleucia

and Ctesiphon, the capitals of the Parthian mo-

narchy. I (hall have occasion to mention this war

in its proper place.

[62] Et tarn in Britannit, was his own just and

emphatic expression. Hist. August. 73.

[64] Upon the insolence and privileges of the sol­

diers, the 16th satire, falsely ascribed to Juvenal,

may be consulted; the style and circumstances of it

would induce me to believe, that it was composed

under the reign of Severus or that of his son.
