Ixxiv NOTES ON THE FIFTEENTH CHAPTER.

ously described by Apuleius, in the eighth book of

his Metamorphoses.

[149] The office of Asiarch was of this nature,

and it is frequently mentioned in Aristides, the in­

scriptions, &c. It was annual and elective. None but

the vainest citizens could desire the honour; none

but the most wealthy could support the expence.

See in the Patres Apostol. torn. ii. p. 200. with

how much indifference Philip the Asiarch conduct­

ed himself in the martyrdom of Polycarp. There

were likewise Bithyniarcba., Lyciarchs, &c.

[150] The modern critics are not disposed to be­

lieve what the fathers almost unanimously assert,

that St. Matthew composed a Hebrew gospel, of

which only the Greek translation is extant. It

seems, however, dangerous to reject their testimony.

[ 1 51 ] Under the reigns of Nero and Domitian, and

in the cities of Alexandria, Antioch, Rome, and Eph-

esus. See Mill. Prolegomena ad Nov. Testament, and

Dr. Lardner's fair and extensive collection, vol. xv.

[152] The Alogians (Epiphanius de Ha:rcs. 51.}

disputed the genuineness of the Apocalypse, because

the church of Thyatira was not yet sounded. Epi­

phanius,, who allows the fact, extricates himself

from the difficulty, by ingeniously supposing, that

it. John wrote in the spirit of prophecy. See Abau-

zit Discours for l'Apocalypse.

[153] The epistles of Ignatius and Dionysius (ap«

Euscb. iv. 23.) point out many churches in Asia and

Greece. That of Athens seems to have been one

of the least flourishing-.

{154] Lucian in Alexandro, c 25. Christianity?

however must have been very unequally diffused

overPontus; since in the middle of the third cen?-

icry there were no more than seventeen believers in

.•he extensive diocese of Neo-Caesarea. Sec M. de

Tillemont, Memoires Ecclesiast. torn. iv. p. 675,

from Basil and Gregory of Nyssa, who were themr

selves natives of Cappadocia.

[155] According to the ancients-, Jesus Christ-

suffered under the consulship of the two Gemini, in

the year 29 os our present :era. Pliny was sent

into Bithynia (according to Pagi) in the year 110.

[160] Basnage, Histoire des Juifs, L ii. c. 20,41,

22, 23. has examined with the most critical accura­

cy, the curious treatise of Philo, which describes

the Therapeutae. By proving that it was composed as

early as the time of Augustus, Basnage has demon*

strated, in spite of Eusebius (1. ii. c. 17.), and a crowd

of modern Catholics, that the Therapeutae were nei­

ther Christians nor monks. It still remains pro­

bable that they changed their name, preserved their

manners, adopted some new articles of faith, and

gradually became the fathers of the Egyptian As­

cetics.

[161] See a letter of Hadrian in the Augustan

History, p. 245.

[162] For the succession of Alexandrian bishops,

consult Renaudot's History, p. 24, &c. This curi­

ous fact is preserved by the patriarch Eutychius

(Annal. torn. i. p. 334. Vers. Pocock), and its inter­

nal evidence would alone be a sufficient answer to all

the objections which Bishop Pearson has urged in

t he Vindiciae Ignatianæ.

could exceed the horror and consternation of the

senate on the appearance of the Bacchanalians,

whose depravity is described, and perhaps exagge-

rated by Livy.

[167] Eusebius, I. vi. c. 43. The Latin trans­

lator (M. de Valois) has thought proper to reduce

the number of presbyters to forty-four.

[168] This proportion of the presbyters and of

the poor, to the rest of the people,, was originally
