THE DECLINE AND FALL

Beyond the nie pr0grefs 0f Christianity was not confined to the Roman

limits of the * °'

Roman em- empire; and according to the primitive fathers, who interpret facts

P by prophecy, the new religion, within a century after the death of

its divine author, had already visited every part of the globe.

Edessa, the principles of Christianity were easily introduced into the

Greek and Syrian cities which obeyed the successors of Artaxerxes;
