OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 391

cletlan, or Constantine, or Valens, or Theodofius, for the object of

his invectives; but they unanimously agree in representing the bur­

den of the public impositions, and particularly the land-tax and

capitation, as the intolerable and increasing grievance of their own

times. From such a concurrence, an impartial historian, who is

obliged to extract truth from satire as well as from panegyric, will

be inclined to divide the blame among the princes whom they ac­

cuse, and to ascribe their exactions much less to their personal vices,

than to the uniform system of their administration. The emperor

Diocletian was indeed the author of that system; but during his

reign, the growing evil was confined within the bounds of modesty

and discretion, and he deserves the reproach of establishing pennV

Antoninus, than from a prince who had never practised the lessons

of philosophy either in the attainment or in the use of supreme

power. Diocletian acquired the glory of giving to the world the

first example of a resignation,cS, which has not been very fre­

quently imitated by succeeding monarchs. The parallel of Charles Resemblance

the Fifth, however, will naturally offer itself to our mind, not only ^Fisih!*

since the eloquence of a modern historian has rendered that name

so familiar to an English reader, but from the very striking resem­

blance between the characters of the two emperors, whose political

abilities were superior to their military genius, and whose specious

virtues were much less the effect of nature than of art. The abdi-

cation of Charles appears to have been hastened by the vicissitude
