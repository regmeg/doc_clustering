THE DECLINE AND FALL

The superstition of the people was not embittered by any mixture

of theological rancour; nor was it confined by the chains of any

speculative system. The devout polytheist, though fondly attached

to his national rites, admitted with implicit faith the different reli足

gions of the earthFear, gratitude, and curiosity, a dream or an

omen, a singular disorder, or a distant journey, perpetually disposed

him to multiply the articles of his belief, and to enlarge the list

of his protectors. The thin texture of the Pagan mythology was

interwoven with various, but not discordant materials* As soon as

it was allowed that sages and heroes, who had lived, or who had

died for the benefit of their country, were exalted to a state of

allegory. Every virtue, and even vice, acquired its divine repre足

sentative; every art and profession its patron, whose attributes, in

the most distant ages and countries, were uniformly derived from

the character of their peculiar votaries. A republic of gods of such

opposite tempers and interests required, in every system, the mode足

rating hand of a supreme magistrate, who was gradually invested, by

flattery and knowledge, with the sublime perfections of an Eternal

Parent, and an Omnipotent Monarch +. Such was the mild

spirit of antiquity, that the nations were less attentive to the

difference, than to the resemblance, of their religious worship.

The Greek, die-Roman, and the barbarian, as they met before their1

respective altars, easily persuaded themselves, that under various

names,
