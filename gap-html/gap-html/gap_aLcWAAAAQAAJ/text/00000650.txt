XXX NOTES ON THE EIGHTH CHAPTER.

to observe, that the Greek writers, who lived almost

in the fame age, agree in placing the æra of Zoro­

aster many hundred, or even thousand years before

their own time. The judicious criticism of Mr.

Moyle perceived, and maintained against his uncle

Dr. Prideaux, the antiquity of the Persian prophet.

See his work, vol. ii.

[8] That ancient kKom was called the Zend.

The language of the commentary, the Pehlvi, though

much more modern, has ceased many ages ago to be

a living tongue. This fact alone ;if it was received

as authentic) sufficiently warrants the antiquity of

those writings, which M. d'Anquetil has brought

into Europe, and translated into French.

[10] I have principally drawn this account from

the Zendavesta of M. d Anquetil, and the Sadder,

subjoined to Dr. Hyde's treatise. It mull, however,

be confessed, that the studied obscuricy os a prophet,

the figurative style of the east, and the deceitful

medium of a French or Latin version, may have

betrayed us into error and heresy, in this abridg­

ment of Persian theology.

[11] The modern Perfees (and in some dcgre«

the Sadder) exalt Ormufd into the first and omni­

potent cause, whilst they degrade Akriman into an

inferior but rebellious spirit. Their desire of pleas­

ing the Mahometans may have contributed to refine

their theological system.

[iz] Herodotus, I. i. c. 131. But Dr. Prideaux

thinks, with reason, that the use of temples was

afterwards permitted in the Magian religion.

[13] Hyde de Relig. Perf. c. 8. Notwithstand­

ing all their distinctions and protestations, which

seem sincere enough, their tyrants the Mahometans,

have constantly stigmatised them, as idolatrous vvor-

fliippers of the fire.

[14] See the Sadder, the smallest part os which

consists of moral precepts. The ceremonies en­

joined are infinite and trifling. Fifteen genuflex­

ions, prayers, &c were required whenever the de­

vout Persian cut his nails or made water; or as often

as he put on the sacred girdle. Sadder Art.

[17] Id. c. 28. Both Hyde and Prideaux affect

to apply to the Magian, the terms consecrated to

the Christian hierarchy.

[iP] Ammian. Marcellin. xxiii. 6. He informs

us (as far as we may credit him) of two curious par­

ticulars; 1. that the Magi derived some of their

most secret doctrines from the Indhn Brachmans;

and, 2. that they were a tribe or family, as wejl as

order.

[19] The divine institution of tythes exhibits a

singular instance of conformity between the law of

Zoroaster- and that of Moses. Those who cannot

otherwise account for it, may suppose, if they please,

that the Magi os the latter times inserted so useful

an interpolation into the writings of their prophet.

[22] Plino (Hist. Natur. I. xxx. c. I.) observes,

that magic held mankind by the triple chain of re­

ligion, of physic, and of astronomy.

tolerant.
