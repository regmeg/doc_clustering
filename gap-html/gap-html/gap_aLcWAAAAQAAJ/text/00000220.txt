i88 THE DECLINE AND FALL

villages and open towns had been deserted on their approach, by the

inhabitants, the cattle was driven away, the provisions removed,

or destroyed, the bridges broke down, nor was any thing left

which could afford either shelter or subsistence to an invader. Such

had been the wise orders of the generals of the senate; whose de­

sign was to protract the war, to ruin the army of Maximin by

the flow operation of famine, and to consume his strength in the

sieges of the principal cities of Italy, which they had plentifully

AquLll stored with

men and provisions from the deserted country. Aquileia

received and withstood the first shock of the invasion. The streams

that issue from the head of the Hadriatic gulf, swelled by the melting

of the winter snows opposed an unexpected obstacle to the arms

of Maximin. At length, on a singular bridge, constructed with

art and difficulty, of large hogsheads, he transported his army to

the opposite bank, rooted up the beautiful vineyards in the neigh­

bourhood of Aquileia, demolished the suburbs, and employed the

timber of the buildings in the engines and towers, with which on

every side he attacked the city. The walls, fallen to decay, during

the security of a long peace, had been hastily repaired on this sud­

den emergency; but the firmest defence of Aquileia consisted in the

constancy of the citizens; all ranks of whom, instead of being

dismayed, were animated by the extreme danger, and their know­

ledge of the tyrant's unrelenting temper. Their courage was

supported and directed by Crispinus and Menophilus, two of the

twenty lieutenants of the senate, who, with a small body of regular

troops, had thrown themselves into the besieged place. The army

of Maximin was repulsed in repeated attacks, his machines de­

stroyed by showers of artificial fire, and the generous enthusiasm of

the Aquileians was exalted into a confidence of success, by the

opinion, that Belenus, their tutelar deity, combated in person in

the defence of his distressed worshippers
