THE DECLINE AND FALL

declaration of his paternal regard for Maxentius, who might obtain

more from his liberality than he could hope from the doubtful

chance of war *5. The offers of Galerius were rejected with firm­

ness, his perfidious friendship refused with contempt, and it was

not long before he discovered, that, unless he provided for his safety

by a timely retreat, he had some reason to apprehend the fate of

Severus. The wealth, which the Romans defended against his ra­

pacious tyranny, they freely contributed for his destruction. The

name of Maximian, the popular arts of his son, the secret distri­

bution of large sums, and the promise of still more liberal rewards,

checked the ardour and corrupted the fidelity of the lllyrian le­

gions; and when Galerius at length gave the signal of the retreat,

it was with some difficulty that he could prevail on his veterans not

to desert a banner which had so often conducted them to victory

and honour. A contemporary writer assigns two other causes for

the failure of the expedition; but they are both of such a nature,

that a cautious historian will scarcely venture to adopt them. We

are told that Galerius, who had formed a very imperfect notion of

the greatness of Rome by the cities of the East, with which he was

acquainted, found his forces inadequate to the siege of that

immense capital. But the extent of a city serves only to render

it more accessible to the enemy; Rome hadJong since been accus­

tomed to submit on the approach of a conqueror; nor could the

temporary enthusiasm of the people have long contended with

the discipline and valour of the legions. We are likewise in­

formed, that the legions, themselves were struck with horror and

remorse, and that those pious sons of the republic refused to vio­

late the sanctity of their ancient parentl6. But when we recollect

with how much ease in the more ancient civil war, the zeal of

party, and the habits of military obedience, had converted the

native citizens of Rome into her most implacable enemies, we

shall be inclined to distrust this extreme delicacy of strangers and
