NOTES ON THE FIFTH CHAPTER.

<£i] T^HEY were originally nine or ten thou-

JL sand men (for Tacitui and Dion are not

agreed upon the subject), divided into as many co­

horts. Vitellius increased them to sixteen thou­

sand, and as far as we can learn from inscriptions,

they never afterwards funk much below that num*

bcr. See Lipsius dc magnitudine Roraani, i. 4.

{4] In the civil war between Vitellius and Ves­

pasian, the Prætorian camp was attacked and de­

fended with all the machines used in the siege of the

best fortified cities. Tacit. Hist. iii. 84.

summit of the Quirinal and Vimiual hills. See

Antiqua, p. 46.

[6] Claudius, raised by the soldiers to the em­

pire, was the first who gave a donative. He gave

quina dtna, 120 1. (Sueton. in Claud, c. 10.):

when Marcus, with his colleague Lucius Verus,

took quiet possession of the throne he gave vicena,

160 1. to each of the guards. Hist. August, p. 2$,

(Dion, lxxiii. p. 1231.) We may form some idea

of the amount of these sums, by Hadrian's complaint,

that the promotion of a L'assar had coil him ter miUiis,

two millions and a half sterling.

Livy, and the second of Dionysius of Halicarnassus,

shew the authority of the people, even in the election

of the king.

p. 63. Hist. August, p. 60. Though the three

historians agree that it was in fact an auction, He­

rodian alone affirms, that it was proclaimed as such

by the soldiers.

[11] Spartianus softens the most odious parts of

the character and elevation of Julian.

[12] Dion Cafsius, at that time prætor, had been

a personal enemy to Julian, 1. lxxiii. p. 123 J.

[13] Hist. August, p. 61. We learn from thence

one curious circumstance, that the new emperor,

whatever had been his birth, was immediately

aggregated to the number of Patrician fami­

lies.

former of whom was raised to the consulship, in th«

fjfih year after its institution.

[17] Spartianus, in his undigested collections,

mixes up all the virtues, and all the vices that enter

into the human composition, and bestows them on

the fame object. Such, indeed, are many of the

characters in the Augustan history.
