OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE,

the historians concurred in teaching, that the Imperial authority was

held, not by the delegated commission, but by the irrevocable resig­

nation of the senate; that the emperor was freed from the restraint

of civil laws, could command by his arbitrary will the lives and for­

tunes of his subjects, and might dispose of the empire as of his pri­

vate patrimony7'. The most eminent of the civil lawyers, and par­

ticularly Papinian, Paulus, and Ulpian, flourished under the house

of Severus; and the Roman jurisprudence having closely united

itself with the system of monarchy, wa& supposed to have attained

its full maturity and perfection.

The contemporaries of Severus, in the enjoyment of the peace and

glory of his reign, forgave the cruelties by which it had been intro­

duced. Posterity, who experienced the fatal effects of his maxims

and example, justly considered him as the principal author of the

decline of the Roman Empire.
