NOTES ON THE SIXTEENTH CHAPTER. lxxxiii

[103] See Mostieim, p. 97. Sulpicius Severus

was the first author of this computation ; though

he seemed desirous of reserving the tenth and greatest

persecution for the coming of the Antichrist.

[104] The testimony given by Pontius Pilate is

first mentioned by Justin. The successive improve­

ments which the story has acquired, (as it passed

through the hands of Tertullian, Eusebius, Epi-

phaniu9, Chrysostom, Orosius, Gregory of Tours,

and the authors of the several editions of the acts of

Pilate) are very fairly stated by Dom Calmet, Disser­

tations fur 1 Ecriture, torn. iii. p. 651, Sec.

[105] On this miracle, as it is commonly called,

of the thundering legion, see the admirable criti­

cism of Mr. Moyle, in his Works, vol. ii. p.

81—£90.

[106] Dion Cassias, or rather his abbreviator

Xiphilin, 1. lxxii. p.. 1206. Mr. Moyle (p. 266)

has explained the condition of the church under the

reign of Commodus.

[107] Compare the life of Caracalla in the Au­

gustan History, with the Epistle of Tertullian to

Scapula. Dr. Jortin (Remarks on Ecclesiastical

History, vol. ii. p. j, 4ec.) considers the cure of Seve­

rus, by the means of holy oil, with a strong desire

to convert it into a miracle,

[108] Tertullian de Faga, c. 13. The present

was made during the feast of the Saturnalia; and

it is a matter of serious concern to Tertullian, that

the faithful should be confounded with the most in­

famous professions which purchased the connivance

of the government.

[109] Euseb. 1. v. c. 23, 24. Mostieim, p.

435—447-

etiam de Christianis sanxit. Hist. August, p. 70.

[111] Sulpicius Severus, 1. ii, p. 384. This com­

putation (allowing for a single exception) is con­

firmed by the history of Eusebius, and by the

writings of Cyprian.

'[112] The antiquity of Christian churches is dis­

cussed by Tillemont (Memoires Ecclefiastiques, torn,

iii. Part ii. p. 68—72.), and by Mr. Moyle (vol.

i.p. 378—39S). The former refers the first con­

struction of them to the peace of Alexander Severus;

the latter, to the peace of Gallienus.

[113] Seethe Augustan History, p. 130. The

Emperor Alexander adopted their method of public­

ly proposing the names of those persons who were

candidates for ordination. It is true, that the ho­

nour of this practice is likewise attributed to the

Jews.

[114] Euseb. Hist. Ecclesiast. 1. vi. c. 21. Hiero-

nym. de Script. Eccles. c. 54. Mamæa was styled

a holy and pious woman, both by the Christians and

the Pagans. From the former, therefore, it was im­

possible that she should deserve that honourable

epithet.

[115] See the Augustan History, p. 123. Mo­

stieim (p. 46;) seems to refine too much on the

domestic religion of Alexander. His design of

building a public temple to Christ (Hist. August, p.

129.), and the objection which was suggested either to

him, or in similar circumstances to Hadrian, appears

to be an improbable report, invented by the Christi­

ans, and credulously adopted by an historian of the

age of Constantine,

[116] Euseb. 1. vi. c. 98.

[117] Orosius, 1. vii, c. 19, mentions Origen as

the object of Maximin's resentment; and Firmili-

anus, a Cappadocian bishop of that age, gives a just

and confined idea of this persecution (apud Cyprian.

Epist. 75.)

[118] The mention of those princes who were

publicly supposed to be Christians, as we find it in an

epistle of Dionysius of Alexandria (ap. Euseb. 1.

vii. c. 10.), evidently alludes to Philip and his fa­

mily; and forms a contemporary evidence, that

such a report had prevailed; but the Egyptian

bishop, who lived at an humble distance from the

court of Rome, expresses himself with a becoming

diffidence, concerning the truth of the fact. The

epistles of Origen (which were extant in the time of

Eusebius, see 1. vi.e. 36,) would most probably de­

cide this curious, rather than important question.

[119] Euseb. I, vj. c. 34.; The story, as is usual,

has been embellished by succeeding writers, and is

confuted, with much superfluous learning, by Fre?

derick Spanheim (Opera Varia, torn. ii. p. 490, &c.)
