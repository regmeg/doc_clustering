artfully, that they did not appear to even

those that entered into their monuments.*

* I suppose those large and magnificent sepulchres in  
the north west, now without, but perhaps of old within

the walls of Jerusalem, and still called the sepulchres of

the kings, are those very sepulchres, in which David,

and so many more kings of Judah were buried; and in

certain of whose rooms, which are not a few, these im­

mense riches might now be deposited; and out of which

vast sums were afterwards taken; certainly by Hyrcanus,

and very probably by Herod the Great also. See Antiq.

objections are built chiefly on the supposal, that this vast

treasure, put now into David's sepulchre, must have been

known all along afterwards; whereas it is more probable

it was not known, till Hyrcanus, in great distress, disco­

vered it, and took out 3000 talents. Nor perhaps was it

afterwards known, that Hyrcanus had left any behind him;

till Herod, prying about every where for money, at length

met with that remainder also, and took it all away. Sepul­

chres were of old looked upon as places so sacred and

inviolable, that treasures might be more safely trusted in

them, than in almost any other places.
