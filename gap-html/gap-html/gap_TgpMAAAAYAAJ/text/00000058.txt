48 [book n. ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS.

this opposition of Joseph's, when she did not

expect it, made her still more violent in her

love to him, and she resolved to accomplish

her design by a second attempt.

When, therefore, there was a festival

coming on, in which it was the custom for

women to come to the public solemnity, she

pretended to her husband that she was sick,

as contriving an opportunity for solitude and

leisure, that she might entreat Joseph again.

This opportunity being obtained, she used

more kind words to him than before, and said

that it had been good for him to have yielded

to her first solicitation, and to have given her

no repulse, both because of the reverence he

ought to bear to her dignity, who solicited

him, and because of the vehemency of her

passion, by which she was forced, though she

were his mistress, to condescend beneath her

dignity. But that he might now, by taking

more prudent advice, wipe off the imputation

of his former folly; for whether it were that

he expected the repetition of her solicitations,

she had now made it, and that with greater

earnestness than before, for that she had pre­

tended sickness on this very account, and had

preferred his conversation before the festival

and its solemnity: or whether he opposed her

former discourses, as not believing she could

be in earnest: she now gave him sufficient

security, by thus repeating her application,

that she meant not in the least by fraud to

impose on him, and assured him, that if he

complied with her affections, he might expect

the enjoyment of the advantages he already

had: and if he were submissive to her, he

should have still greater advantages: but that

he must look for revenge and hatred from

her in case he rejected her desires, and pre­

ferred the reputation of chastity before his

mistress; for that he would gain nothing by

such procedure, as she would then become

his accuser, and would falsely pretend to her

husband that he attempted her chastity, and

that Potiphar would hearken to her words

rather than to his, let his be ever so agree­

able to the truth.

But though the woman said thus, and even

with tears in her eyes, Joseph was not dis­

suaded from his chastity, nor induced by fear

to a compliance with her: but he opposed

alike her solicitations and her threatenings,

and was afraid to do an ill thing, choosing

rather to undergo the sharpest punishment,

than to enjoy his present advantages by doing

what his own conscience knew would justly

deserve that he should die for it. He also

reminded her that she was a married woman,

and that she ought to cohabit with her hus­

band only, and desired her to suffer these

considerations to have more weight with her

than the short pleasure of lustful dalliance

which would occasion trouble and repentance

afterwards, and yet would not amend what

had been done amiss. He also suggested the

fear she would be in lest they should be

caught, and that the advantage of conceal­

ment was uncertain, and that only while the

wickedness was not known would there be

any quiet for them. But that she might have

the enjoyment of her husband's company

without any danger, and he told her, that in

the company of her husband she might have

great boldness, from a good conscience, both

before God and before men; nay, that she

would act more consistently as his mistress,

and make use of her authority over him bet­

ter while she persisted in her chastity, than

when they were both ashamed for what wick­

edness they had been guilty of; and that it

is much better to depend on a good life known

to have been so, than upon the hopes of the

concealment of evil practices.

Joseph, by saying this and more, tried to

restrain the violent passion of the woman, and

to reduce her affections within the rules of

reason; but she grew more ungovernable, and

earnest in the matter: and since she despaired

of persuading him, she laid her hands upon

him, and had recourse to violence. But as

soon as Joseph had got away from her anger,

leaving his garment with her, and leaped out

of her chamber, she was equally afraid lest

he should discover her lewdness to her hus­

band, and incensed at the affront he had

offered her, so she resolved to be before-hand

with him, and to accuse him falsely to Poti­

phar, and by that means to revenge herself

for his pride and contempt; thinking it a wise

thing in itself, and also becoming a woman,

thus to prevent his accusation. Accordingly

she sat sorrowfully, and in confusion, framing

herself so hypocritically and angrily, that the

sorrow, which was really occasioned by her

disappointment, might appear to be for an

attempt upon her chastity: so that when her
