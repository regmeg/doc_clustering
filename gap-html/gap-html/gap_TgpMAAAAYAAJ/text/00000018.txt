x AUTHOR'S PREFACE.

nature of the universe; while our legislator speaks some things wisely, but
enigmatically;

and others under a decent allegory: but still explains such things as require
a direct ex­

plication plainly and expressly. However, those who have a mind to know the
reasons of

every thing, may find here a very curious philosophical theory, which I now
indeed shall

wave the explication of; but if God afford me time for it,* I will set about
writing it after I

have finished the present work. I shall now betake myself to the history
before me, after I

have first mentioned what Moses says of the creation of the world, which I
find described

in the sacred books, after the manner following:—

* As to this intended work of Josephus's concerning the reasons of many of the Jewish laws, and what philoso­  
phical or allegorical sense they would bear; the loss of which work is by some
of the learned not much regretted;

I am inclinable, in part, to Fabricius's opinion, ap. Havercamp, page 63, 64,
that " We need not doubt but, among

some vain and frigid conjectures derived from Jewish imaginations, Josephus
would have taught us a great number

of excellent and useful things ; which perhaps, nobody, neither among the
Jews, nor among the Christians, can now

inform as of."
