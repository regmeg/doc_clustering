fleeing away from him; that he was disturbed,

and fell on his face, and on his two hands,

and that a certain person touched him, and

at the same time bid him to rise, and see

what would befall his countrymen after many

generations. He also related, that when he

stood up, he was shewn a great ram with

many horns growing out of his head; and that

the last was nigher than the rest; that after

this he looked to the west, and saw a he-goat

carried through the air from that quarter;

that he rushed upon the ram with violence,

and smote him twice with his horns, and

overthrew him to the ground, and trampled

upon him; that afterward he saw a very

treat horn growing out of the forehead of the

e-goat; and that when it was broken offj

four horns grew up that were exposed to

each of the four winds; and he wrote that

out of them arose another lesser horn, which,

as he said, waxed great; and that God shewed

to him, that it should fight against his nation,

and take their city by force, and bring the

temple worship to confusion, and forbid the

sacrifices to be offered, for one thousand two

hundred and ninety-six days.* Daniel wrote

that he saw these visions in the plain of Susa,

and he hath informed us that God interpreted

the appearance of this vision after the fol­

lowing manner:—He said, that the ram sig­

nified the kingdom of the Medes and Persians,

and the horns those kings that were to reign

in them; and that the last horn signified the

last king; and that he should exceed all the

kings in riches and glory; that the he-goat

signified that one should come and reign

from the Greeks, who should twice fight with

the Persians, and overcome him in battle,

and should receive his entire dominion; that

by the great horn, which sprang out of the

forehead of the he-goat was meant the first

king; and that the springing up of four horns

upon its falling off} and the conversion of

every one of them to the four quarters of the

earth, signified the succours that should arise

after the death of the first king; and the par­

tition of the kingdom among them; and that

they should be neither his children, nor of

his kindred that should reign over the habit­

able earth for many years; and that from

among them there should arise a certain king

that should overcome our nation and laws,

and should take away the political govern­

ment, and should spoil the temple, and forbid

the sacrifices to be offered, for three years.

Accordingly it happened that our nation

suffered these things under Antiochus Epi-

phanes, according to Daniel's vision; and

what he wrote many years before they came

to pass. In the same manner Daniel wrote

concerning the Roman government, and that

our country should be made desolate by them.

All these things did this man leave in writing,

as God had shewed them to him. Insomuch

that such as read his prophecies, and see

how they have been fulfilled, may justly

wonder at the honour wherewith God ho­

noured Daniel; and may thence discover

how the Epicureans are in an error, who cast

Providence out of human life; and do not

believe that God takes care of the affairs of

the world; nor that the universe is governed

and continued in being by that blessed and

immortal nature; but say that the world is

carried along of its own accord, without a

ruler and a curator, which, were it destitute

of a guide to conduct it, as they imagine, it

would be like ships without pilots, which we

see destroyed by the winds; or like chariots

without drivers, which are overturned: so

would the world be dashed to pieces by being

carried without a Providence, and so perish

and come to nought. So that by the afore­

mentioned predictions of Daniel those men

seem to err from the truth, who determine

that God exercises no Providence over human

affairs. For if that were the case, that the

world went on by mechanical necessity, we

should not see that all things would come to

pass according to his prophecy. Now as to

myself I have so described these matters as I

have found them and read them: but if any

one be inclined to another opinion about

them, let him enjoy his sentiments without

any blame from me.
