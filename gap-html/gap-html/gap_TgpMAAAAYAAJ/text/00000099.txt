in battle, and hoped to be thereby at length

delivered from all their miseries. Nay, they

desired that Moses would immediately lead

them against their enemies, without the least

delay, that no backwardness might be an hin­

drance to their present resolution; so Moses

classed all that were fit for war into different

troops, and set over them Joshua, the son of

Nun, of the tribe of Ephraim; one that was of

treat courage, and patient to undergo la-

ours; of great abilities to understand, and

to speak what was proper, and very serious

in the service of God, and indeed, made like

another Moses, a teacher of piety towards

God. He also appointed a small party of the

armed men to be near the wafer, and to take

care of the children and the women, and of

the entire camp; so that whole night they

prepared themselves for the battle, they took

their weapons, if any of them had such as

were well made, and attended to their com­

manders, as ready to rush forth to the battle

as soon as Moses should give the word of

command. Moses also kept awake, teach­

ing Joshua after what manner he should order

his camp; but when the day began, Moses

called Joshua again, and exhorted him to ap­

prove himself in deeds such a one as his repu­

tation made men expect from him, and to

gain glory by the present expedition in the

opinion of those under him, for his exploits in

this battle: he also gave a particular exhor­

tation to the principal men of the Hebrews,

and encouraged the whole army as it stood

before him; and when he had thus animated

them, both by his words and works, and pre­

pared every thing, he retired to a mountain,

and committed the army to God and to

Joshua, v^,

The armies having joined battle, soon came

to a close fight hand to hand, both sides shew­

ing great alacrity, and encouraging one ano­

ther; and, indeed, while Moses stretched out

his hands* towards heaven, the Hebrews

were too hard for the Amalekites; but Moses

* This eminent circumstance, that while Moses's hands  
were held up towards heaven, the Israelites prevailed;

and while they were let down towards the earth, the

Amalekites prevailed; seems the earliest intimation we

have of the proper posture, used of old, in solemn prayer,

which was the stretching out the hands and eyes towards

heaven, as other passages of the Old and New Testament

inform us. Nay, hy the way, this posture seems to have

continued in the Christian church till the clergy, instead

not being able to sustain his hands thus

stretched out (for as often as he let down his

hands, so often were his own people worsted,)

he bade his brother Aaron, and Hur, their

sister Miriam's husband, to stand on each side

of him, and take hold of his hands, and not

to permit his weariness to prevent it, but to

assist him in the extension of his hands.

When this was done, the Hebrews conquered

the Amalekites by main force; and, indeed,

they had all perished, unless the approach of

night had obliged the Hebrews to desist from

killing any more. So our forefathers obtained

a most signal and most seasonable victory;

for they not only overcame those that fought

against them, but also terrified the neigh­

bouring nations, and got great and splendid

advantages, which they obtained of their ene­

mies by their hard pains in this battle; for

when they had taken the enemies' camp, they

got great booty for the public, and for their

own private families, whereas till then they

had not any plenty even of necessary food.

The afore-mentioned victory was also the

occasion of their prosperity, not only for the

present, but for future ages also; for they not

only made slaves of the bodies of their ene­

mies, but effectually damped their nlinds: and

after this battle became terrible to all that

dwelt round about them. They also acquired

a vast quantity of riches; for a great deal of

silver and gold was left in the enemies' camp,

as also brazen vessels, which they made com­

mon use of in their families; many utensils

also that were embroidered, there were of

both sorts; that is, of what were woven, and

what were the ornaments of their armour and

other things that served for use to their family,

and for the furniture of their rooms; they got

also the prey of their cattle and of whatso­

ever uses to follow camps, when they remove

from one place to another; so the Hebrews

now valued themselves upon their courage,

and claimed great merit for their valour; and

they perpetually inured themselves to take

of learning their prayers by heart, read them out of a

book, which is in a great measure inconsistent with such

an elevated posture, and which seems to me to have been

only a later practice under the corrupt state of the church.

Though the constant use of divine forms of prayer, praise,

and thanksgiving, appears to have been the practice of

God's people, Patriarchs, Jews, and Christians, in all the

past ages.
