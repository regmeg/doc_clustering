slaughter of the Ethiopians. Now when the

Egyptian array had once tasted of this pros­

perous success, by the means of Moses, they

did not slacken their diligence, insomuch that

the Ethiopians were in danger of being re­

duced to slavery and complete destruction;

and at length they retired to Saba, a royal

city of Ethiopia, which Cambyses afterward

named Meroe, after the name of his own sis­

ter. The place was to be besieged with very

great difficulty, since it was both encom­

passed by the Nile, and the other rivers As-

tapus and Astaborus, made it a very difficult

thing for such as attempted to pass over them;

for the city was situate in a retired place, and

was inhabited after the manner of an island,

being encompassed with a strong wall, and

having the rivers to guard them from their

enemies; and having great ramparts, between

the wall and rivers, insomuch, that when the

waters come with the greatest violence it can

never be drowned, which ramparts make it

next to impossible, for even such as have

passed over the rivers, to take the city. How­

ever, while Moses was uneasy at the army's

lying idle, (for the enemy durst not come to

a battle,) this accident happened: Tharbis,

the daughter of the king of the Ethiopians,

happened to see Moses, as he led the army

near to the walls, and fought with great cou­

rage; and admiring the subtilty of his un­

dertakings, and believing him to be the author

of the Egyptians' success, when they had be­

fore despaired of recovering their liberty, and

to be the occasion of the great danger that

the Ethiopians were in, when they had be­

fore boasted of their great achievements, she

fell deeply in love with him, and, upon the

prevalency of that passion, sent to him the

most faithful of all her servants to discourse

with him about their marriage. He hereupon

accepted the offer, on condition she would

procure the delivering up of the city, and

gave her the assurance of an oath to take her

to his wife; and that when he had once taken

possession of the city, he would not break his

oath to her. No sooner was the agreement

made, but it took effect immediately; and

when Moses had cut off* the Ethiopians, he

gave thanks to God, and having consummated

is marriage, led the Egyptians back to their

land.

CHAP. XI.

OF MOSES S FLIGHT OUT OF EGYPT INTO MIDIAN.

NOW the Egyptians, after they had been

preserved by Moses, entertained an

hatred to him, and were very eager in effect­

ing their designs against him, and suspecting

that he would take occasion, from his good

success, to raise a sedition, and bring innova­

tions into Egypt, they told the king he ought

to be slain. The king had also some inten­

tions of the same nature, and this as well out

of envy at his glorious expedition at the head

of his army, as out of fear at being brought

low by him, and being instigated by the sa­

cred scribes, he was ready to undertake to

kill Moses; but when he had learned before­

hand what plots there were against him, he

went away privately; and because the public

roads were watched, he took his flight through

the deserts, and where his enemies could not

suspect he would travel; and though destitute

of food, he went on, and despised that diffi­

culty courageously; and when he came to

the city Midian, which lay upon the Red Sea,

and was so denominated from one of Abra­

ham's sons by Keturah, he sat upon a certain

well, and rested himself there after his labo­

rious journey, and the affliction he had been

in. It was not far from the city, and the time

of the day was noon, where he had an occa­

sion offered him, by the custom of the coun­

try, of doing what recommended his virtue,

and afforded him an opportunity of bettering

his circumstances.

For that country having but little water,

the shepherds used to seize on the wells be­

fore others came, lest their flocks should want

water, and lest it should be spent by others

before they came. There were now come,

therefore, to this well, seven virgin sisters, the

daughters of Raguel, a priest, and one thought

worthy by the people of the country of great

honour: these virgins, who took care of their

father's flock, which sort of work it was cus­

tomary and very familiar for women to do in

the country of the Troglodytes, came first of

all, and drew water out of the well in a quan­

tity sufficient for their flocks into troughs,

which were made for the reception of that

water: but the shepherds came upon the
