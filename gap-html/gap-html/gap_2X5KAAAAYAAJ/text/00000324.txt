316' THE HISTORY

pose, in all questions touching the sum

demanded, he regarded neither the truth

nor the justice of the case. To be rich

was to be liable to taxation, and money

was to be raised in all events. Informa­

tions followed without number, and con­

fiscations without mercy. Oppressive as

these proceedings were, the necessity of

the times gave a colourable e.xcuse; but

the misfortune was, the practice did not

cease with the war, but continued, in the

season of profound peace, to harass and

oppress mankind. Vespasian, in the be­

ginning of his reign, showed no disposi­

tion to enrich his coffers by acts of injus­

tice ; but, being corrupted afterwards by

the smiles of fortune, and listening to

pernicious counsels, he learned the arts

of rapacity, and dared to practise them (a).

Mucianus, from his own funds, contri-

, buted to the exigencies of the Avar, gene­

rous from Ins private purse, that he might

afterwards indemnify himself at the ex­

pense of the public. The rest of the

officers, following his example, advanced

sums of money, but were not, in like

manner, repaid with usury.
