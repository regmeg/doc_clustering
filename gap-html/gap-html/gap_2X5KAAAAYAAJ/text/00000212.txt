book camp. The Othonians were struck with

terror, and near the fleet all was tumult

and disorder. The surprise, however, soon

began to subside. The Othonians betook

themselves to an adjacent hill, and, having

there collected their strength, rushed down

with impetuous fuiy. A dreadful slaugh足

ter followed. The Tungrian cohorts stood

the brunt of the action, till their com足

manding officers fell under a shower of

darts. The Othonians conquered, but

their victory was dearly bought. They

pursued the flying enemy with more rage

than prudence, when the Treverian ca足

valry, wheeling round, attacked them in

the rear, and put a large party to the

sword. From this time the two armies

remained inactive. As if a truce had

taken place, and both sides had agreed by

compact to suspend hostilities, and no more

molest each other by sudden incursions,

the Vitellians retired to Antipolis, a mu足

nicipal town of Narbon Gaul, and the

Othonians to Albingaunum, in the inland

part of Liguria.
