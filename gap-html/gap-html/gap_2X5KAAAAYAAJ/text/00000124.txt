114 THE HISTORY

book thereupon Yitellius, flushed with hope,

abounding in resources, and strong in

numbers, resolved to carry the war into

Italy by two different routes, under the

conduct of two commanders. Fabius Va-

lens was sent forward, with instructions to

draw to his interest the people of Gaul,

and, if he found them obstinate, to lay

waste their country with fire and sword.

He was afterwards to pass over the Cottian

Alps{a\ and make an irruption into Italy.

Caecina, the other general, was ordered to

take a nearer way, over the Penine moun足

tains, and make his descent on that side.

The floAver of the army from the Lower

Rhine, with the eagle of the fifth legion,

and the cohorts and cavalry, amounting

to forty thousand men, were put under

the command of Valens. Caecina ad足

vanced from the Upper Germany with no

less than thirty thousand, of which the

one-and-twentieth legion was the main

strength. Each commander had a rein足

forcement of German auxiliaries. Vitel足

lius followed them, with a third army, tq

crush whatever resisted, and bring up the

whole weight of the war.
