380 NOTES ON THE

speech upon this occasion shows that he could think

with dignity. See Suetonius, life of Otho, s. lO.

Section XLVIII.

(a) Augustus, Tiberius, and Caligula, were of the

Julian line; Claudius, and Nero (by adoption) were of

the Claudian ; Galba was of the house of Servius; Otho,

of the Salvian family.

Section XLIX.

(a) This was Verginius Rufus, who conquered Vindex

in Gaul, and had the moderation to decline the imperial

dignity when offered to him by the legions. See Appen­

dix to Annals, xvi. s. 12.

(A) Nero, in his last distress, fearing that his head

would be exhibited as a public spectacle, gave directions

for his funeral. Otho did the same: though tainted with

Nero's vices, he closed the scene with dignity.

(c) Plutarch tells us, that he himself visited Otho's

tomb at Brixellum. Those perishable materials have

long since mouldered away; but the epitaph, written by

Martial, will never die. The poet admits that Otho led

a dissolute life; but adds, that, in his end, he was no

way inferior to Cato.

Dum dubitaret adhuc belli civilis Enyo,

Forsitan et posset vlncere mollis Otho;

Damnavit multo staturum sanguine Martefn,

Et fodit certa pectora nuda manu.

Sit Cato dum vivit, san£ vel Caesare major;

Dum moritur, numquid major Othone fuit ?
