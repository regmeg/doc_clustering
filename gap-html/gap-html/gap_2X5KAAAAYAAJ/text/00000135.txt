tians had, immemorially maintained a gar- book

rison. The Romans seized the whole as law­

ful plunder. An act of violence, so unwar­

ranted, raised the indignation of the people*

Determined to make reprisals, they inter­

cepted a small party on their way to Pan-

nonia, with letters from the German army

to the legions stationed in that country.

They seized the papers, and detained in

custody a centurion with some of his sol­

diers. This, to such a man as Caecina, was

ample provocation. He wished for notlung

so much as a pretence for open hostility.

Whenever he took umbrage, he struck his

blow without delay. To defer the punish­

ment, were, to leave time for repentance.

He marched against the Helvetians, and,

having laid waste the country, sacked a

place, built, fusing the leisure of a long

peace, in the form of a municipal town,

remarkable for the beauty of the situation*

and, by reason of its salubrious waters (b),

much frequented. Not content with this

act of revenge, he sent ■dispatches into

Rhaetia, with orders to the auxiliaries of

that country to hang upon the rear,of the

Helvetians, while he advanced to attack-

them in front.
