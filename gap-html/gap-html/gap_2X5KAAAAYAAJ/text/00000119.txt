words, which a few days before resounded

with so much energy, Avere dropt at once;

and the men, it now was plain, were never

in their hearts the soldiers of a republic.

The Agrippinian people, the Treveri, and

Lingones were determined not to be be足

hind-hand in demonstrations of zeal. They

offered a supply of arms and horses, of

men and money, in proportion to their re足

spective abilities. The strong and valiant

were willing to serve in person; the rich

opened their treasure; and the skilful

gave their advice. The leading chiefs, as

well in the colonies as in the camp, who

had already enriched themselves by the

spoils of war, wished for another victory

that might bring with it an accumulation

of wealth. The zeal with which they enr

tered into the league, was. what might be

expected; but the alacrity of the common

men Avas beheld with wonder. Poor and

destitute, they made a tender of their tra足

velling subsistence, their belts, their ac足

coutrements, and the silver ornaments of

their armour; all excited by one general

impulse, a sudden fit of blind enthusiasm.
