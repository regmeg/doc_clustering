182 THE HISTORY

book ted to his love of queen Berenice (a). It

is true, that princess had engaged his af足

fections ; but the business of his heart never

interfered with the duties of his station.

Youth being the season of pleasure, Titus

gave a loose to those desires, which he

afterwards so well knew how to regulate.

In his own reign he was remarkable for

that self-control, which he never prac足

tised under his father. He set sail from

Corinth, and after steering along the coast

of Achaia and Asia, which lay to the left,

he directed his course towards Rhodes and

Cyprus. From those islands he went, by

a more bold navigation (6), across the Open

sea to the coast of Syria. At Cyprus cu足

riosity led him to visit the temple of the

Paphian Venus, famous for the worship

paid by the inhabitants, and the conflux

of strangers who resorted thither from all

parts. If we take this opportunity to trace

the origin of that singular worship (c), and

to describe the situation of the temple,

and the form of the Goddess, differing en足

tirely from what is seen in any other place,

the digression will, perhaps, be neither

tedious, nor unacceptable to the reader.
