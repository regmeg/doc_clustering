8 THE HISTORY

book three civil wars (b); with foreign enemies

a greater number, and, in some conjunc­

tures, both depending at once; prosperity

in the East, disasters in the West; Illyri-

cum thrown into convulsions; both the

Gauls on the eve of a revolt; Britain (c)

conquered, and, in the moment of con­

quest, lost again; the Sarmatians and the

Suevians (d) leagued against the Romans;

the Dacian name ennobled by alternate

victory and defeat; and, finally, the Par-

thians taking the field under the banners

of a pretended Nero (e). In the course

of the work, we shall see Italy over­

whelmed with calamities; new wounds

inflicted, and the old, which time had

closed, opened again and bleeding afresh;

cities sacked by the enemy, or swallowed

up by earthquakes (/), and the fertile

country of Campania made a scene of de­

solation; Rome laid waste by fire; her

antient and most venerable temples smok­

ing on the ground ; the capitol (g) wrapt

in flames by the hands of frantic citizens ;

the holy ceremonies of religion violated;

adultery reigning without controul; the

adjacent islands filled with exiles; rocks
