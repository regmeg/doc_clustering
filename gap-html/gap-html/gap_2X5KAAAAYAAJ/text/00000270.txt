he had dispatched himself. His body

was burnt without delay. This had been

his earnest request, lest his head (b) should

fall into the hands of his enemies, and be

made a public spectacle. He was borne

on the shoulders of the praetorian soldiers

to the funeral pile. The men, during the

procession, paid all marks of respect to

his remains. They printed kisses on his

hands, and on the mortal wound, and, in

a flood of tears, poured forth their warmest

praise. At the funeral pile some of the

soldiers put an end to their lives; not from

any consciousness of guilt, nor yet im­

pelled by fear; but to emulate the ex­

ample of their prince, and to show them­

selves faithful to the last. At Bedriacum,

Placentia, and other camps, numbers fol­

lowed the example. A sepulchre (c) was

raised to the memory of Otho, but of an

ordinary structure, protected by its mean­

ness, and therefore likely to last.

thirty-seventh year of his age. He was

born in the municipal city of Ferentum.
