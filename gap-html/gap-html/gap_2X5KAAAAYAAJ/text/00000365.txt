FIRST BOOK OF THE HISTORY. 357

passages, which are transplanted into the French play,

would be an agreeable amusement to every reader of

taste, but cannot be comprised within the limits of a

note. Tt will be sufficient to state what Corneille him­

self has said in the preface to his tragedy. He makes

it his boast that he translated as much as he possibly

could ; and it does not appear that the malignant critics

of that day charged him with petty larceny, or railed at

him with virulence for the use which he thought proper

to make of a great historian. Corneille's words are as

follows: Le svjet de cctte tragedie est tiri de Tacite,

qui commence ses histoires par celle-ci. Les caractcres de

ceux que j'y Jais parler, y sont ks mimes que Chez cet

incomparable auteur, quej'ai traduit (ant qn'il in'u Ste

possible.
