Section LXXXIX.

(a) Furius Camillus Scribonianus commanded in

Dalmatia, A. U. C. 795. Being a man of enterprise

and bold ambition, he induced the soldiers to swear

fidelity to himself, and went into open rebellion. His

letters to the emperor Claudius were written in a tone

of menace, requiring him to abdicate, and live a pri­

vate citizen. In the mean time, the rebel legions,

with the versatility common to the military mind, re­

turned to their duty; Scribonianus fled to a small island

of the Adriatic, on the coast of Illyricum, and there

was. seized and put to death by Volaginius, a common

soldier, on the fifth day of his revolt. Suetonius, in

Claudio, s. 35. See Tacitus, Hist. ii. s. 75.

(£) Numa, the founder of religious ceremonies,

made the Romans believe, that as long as they preserved

the celestial arms, called Ancilia, which, he said, were

sent down by the gods, Rome would prove invincible,

and triumph over all her enemies. Accordingly we

read in Livy the procession of the Salian priests, on

stated days, attending the Ancilia with song and dance

through the streets of Rome. Salios ccelestia arma,

quae Ancilia appellantur,ferre) ac per urlem irecanentet

carmina cum tripudiis solemnique saltatu jusserat Numa.

Livy, lib. i. s. 20. This institution was neglected by

Otho. Suetonius, Life of Otho, s. 8.
