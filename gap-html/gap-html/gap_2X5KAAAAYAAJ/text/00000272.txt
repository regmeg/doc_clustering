waved its wings, and vanished out of sight.

The people of the village aver the fact;

and according to curious observers, who

LI. The grief of the soldiers, at the fu­

neral ceremony, drove them, in a fit of

distraction, to another mutiny. No offi­

cer assumed the command; no one inter­

fered to allay the ferment. The men de­

manded a sight of Verginius; one moment

calling upon him to accept the sovereignty,

and the next, with mingled prayers and

menaces, pressing him to undertake an

embassy on their behalf to Valens and

Caecina. Verginius, seeing them deter­

mined to enter his house by force, made

his escape at the back door. The cohorts

that lay encamped at Brixellum, deputed

Rubrius Gallus with terms of submission.

That officer obtained their pardon. At

the same time Flavius Sabinus made terms

for himself, and, with the troops under

his command, submitted to the conqueror.
