" conduct. I brought with me to the

" seat of government an upright inten-

" tion; and that I now act on the same

" principle may be fairly seen, when, in

" my present choice, I postpone not only

" my own relations, but even those of

" your own family. You have a brother,

" in point of nobility your equal; by

" priority of birth your superior; and,

" if your merit did not supersede him,

" a man worthy of the highest eleva-

" you must now beware of her smiles.

" Prosperity tries the human heart with

" the deepest probe, and draws forth the

" hidden character. We struggle with

" adversity, but success disarms us. I

" trust, however, that you will carry

" with you, to the highest station, the

" candour of your mind, your good faithj

" your independent spirit, and your con-

" stancy in friendship; virtues that exalt
