SECOND BOOK OF THE HISTORY. 369

Section II.

(a) Berenice was sister to Agrippa II. and wife of

Herod, king of Chalcis, in Syria. For more of her, and

her connexion with Titus, see Appendix to Hist. v. s. 21.

(b) When Titus no longer sails along the coast, but

puts off to sea, Tacitus calls it a bolder voyage, audentio-

ribus spatiis; an expression, which, in the present state

of navigation, may provoke the smile of a mariner. The

compass was not invented, and men did not like to lose

sight of the shore.

(c) At the town of Paphos, which stood on the western

sideof the isle of Cyprus, a temple was dedicated to Venus,

thence called the Paphian Venus. The account of the

rites and ceremonies, which Tacitus gives us, has been

condemned by some critics as an idle digression: but

when it is considered that the history of superstition was

not uninteresting to the' Romans, this passage will not

be thought improper. The great historian has been

charged with irreligion; but the attention shown on this

occasion, and many others, to the various modes of

worship, may serve to vindicate his character.

Section III.

(a) Aerias has been mentioned in another place, as

the founder of the Paphian temple: Annals, iii. s. 63.

Tacitus adds, that the name of Aerias was applied by

many to the goddess herself; and accordingly, Pausa-

nias, lib. i. cap. 14, calls her Ovgavlav.

(b) Cinyras is said by Apollodorus to have been one

of the kings of Assyria.

(c) Thamiras introduced the science of augury, which

was founded altogether in deceit and fraud. AccorÂ­

dingly, we find that care was taken to keep it in the
