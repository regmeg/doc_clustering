vour of another impostor, who took the name of Nero in

the reign of Titus, A. U. C. 834, and afterwards in the

reign ofDomitian, A.U. 841.

(f) The cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii were de­

stroyed by an eruption of the lava of Mount Vesuvius,

in the beginning of Titus's reign, A.U. C. 832.

(g) See the conflagration of the Capitol, Hist. iii.

s. 67 and 71.

(/t) Collectors of the imperial revenue were instituted

by the emperors, in order to entrench on the power of

the proconsuls, who were the proper officers in all the

provinces that remained under the authority of the se­

nate. Informers were raised to the office of imperial

procurators, and obtained weight and influence in the

cabinet. Adepti procurationes et interiorem potentiam.

(i) The treachery of friends was the scourge and pest

of society for several years. Trajan repressed the mis­

chief. See his praise for that public benefit in Pliny's

Panegyric, s. 42. Reddita est amicis fides, liheris pie-

(a) Some of the commentators have objected to the

sentiment expressed by Tacitus in this place. JBrotier

calls it alrox sententia. But what is the fair construc­

tion ? It is this : The crimes of the Roman people were

such, that they could no longer expect the protection of

the gods. They had drawn down the vengeance of hea­

ven. Lucan has a similar sentiment:

Felix Roma quidem, civesque habitura beatos, #

Si Libertatis superis tarn cura fuisset,

Quam vindicta placet.

Pharsal. lib. iv. ver. 107.
