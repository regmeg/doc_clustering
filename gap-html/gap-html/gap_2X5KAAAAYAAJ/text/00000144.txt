134 THE HISTORY

book Such at all times is the policy of the

worst of men: they dread a reverse of

fortune, and, in the hour of need, hope to

shelter themselves under the protection of

some pernicious, favourite. Innocence is

no part of their care; they know that the

guilty are ever ready to defend each other.

But the friendship of Vinius, who was still

remembered with detestation, was an

additional spur to the populace. They

crowded together from all quarters; they

surrounded the palace; they filled the

forum; and in the circus and the theatre,

where licentiousness is most apt to s'how

itself, they clamoured, with a degree of

violence little short of sedition, for the

punishment of a vile malefactor. Tigellir

nus was then at the baths of* Sinuessa (b).

Orders were sent to him to put a period

to his life. He received the fatal ne^s in

a circle of his concubines; he took leave

with tenderness; and after mutual enir

braces, and other trifling delays, lie cut

his throat with a razor; by the pusil­

lanimity of his last moments disgracing

pyen the infamy of his former life. , — -'
