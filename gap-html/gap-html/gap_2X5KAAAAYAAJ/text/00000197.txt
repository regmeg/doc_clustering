tf as there decided by the forces of the b o o k

West. It is true, that Pompey, Cassius,

Brutus, and Anthony, carried the war

across the Mediterranean, and had reason

to repent. Syria and Judaea heard of the

Caesars, but seldom saw them. The

legions, undisturbed by sedition, had no

war upon their hands. Embroiled at dif­

ferent times with the Parthians (a), they

had a few slight conflicts, with doubtful

success, and passed the rest of the year in

profound tranquillity. In the late civil■

war (b), when every part of the empire was

in motion, the East was perfectly quiet.

Galba obtained the sovereignty, and the

oriental legions acquiesced; but it was no

sooner known that Otho and Vitellius were

engaged in an impious war against their

country, than they began to shake off their

pacific temper. They saw the supreme

authority in the hands of other armies,

who granted it away at their own pleasure,

and reaped the profits of every revolution,'

while the soldiers of the East had nothing

but a change of'servitude, condemned

at the will of others, to submit to new

masters.
