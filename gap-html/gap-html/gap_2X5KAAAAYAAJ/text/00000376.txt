NOTES

ON

THE SECOND BOOK

OF

THE HISTORY.

Section I.

(a) THACITUS says that fortune was then laying the

foundation of a new imperial house, which

proved to be beneficial and disastrous to the people, and

also to the very family that was raised to that pre-emi­

nence. This is perfectly clear, when we consider, that

Rome was happy under Vespasian and Titus, but groaned

under Domhian, till the tyrant was destroyed, and the

Flavian line was extinguished.

{b) Titus, at this time, was in his twenty-eighth year.

By the favour of Narcissus, to whom Vespasian paid his

court, Titus was educated in the palace with Britannicus,

the son of Claudius. The prince, then destined by his

father to succeed to the empire, was cut off by the vil-

lany of Nero; and Titus, whose elevation was not then

foreseen, lived to be the delight of the Roman people.

(c) Suetonius tells us that Narcissus, the favourite

freedman, consulted a fortune-teller about the destiny of

Britannicus : the answer was unfavourable fo the young

prince, but assured Titus that he was born to the impe­

rial dignity. Suetonius, in Tito, s. 2.
