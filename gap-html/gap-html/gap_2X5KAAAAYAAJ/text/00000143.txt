OF TACITUS. 133

obtained by his crimes. To his effeminate

qualities he united some of those rougher

evils which may be called manly passions,

such as avarice and cruelty. Having

gained an entire ascendant over the affec­

tions of Nero, he was, in some instances,

the adviser of the horrors committed by

that prince, and in others the chief actor,

without the knowledge of his master. He

corrupted Nero at first, and in the end de­

serted him. Hence it was that the blood

of a criminal was never demanded with

such violent clamour. The men who

detested the memory of Nero, and those

who still regretted him, concurred in one

opinion. They all joined in the cry for

public justice. During the short reign of

Galba, he lived secure under the protec­

tion of Titus Vinius. In fact, he had some

merit with that minister, having saved the

life of his daughter; but, in that very act,

humanity was not his motive. A man

who had shed so much innocent blood,

could not be suspected of a single virtue.

His design was, by a new connection, to

screen himself from future danger.
