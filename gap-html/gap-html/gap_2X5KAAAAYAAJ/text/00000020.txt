10 THE HISTORY

book exile; wives followed the fortune of their

husbands; relations stood forth in the

cause of their unhappy khidred ; sons ap­

peared in defence of their fathers ; slaves

on the rack gave proofs of their fidelity;

eminent citizens, under the hard hand of

oppression, were reduced to want and

misery, and, even in that distress, re­

tained an unconquered spirit. We shall

see others firm to the last, and, in

their deaths, nothing.inferior to the ap­

plauded characters of antiquity. In ad­

dition to the misfortunes usual in. the

course of human transactions, we shall

see the earth teeming with prodigies, the

sky overcast with omens, thunder rolling

with dreadful denunciation, and a variety

of prognostics, sometimes auspicious, often

big with terror, occasionally uncertain,

dark, equivocal, frequently direct and

manifest. In a word, the gods never gave

such terrible instructions, nor, by, the

slaughter of armies, made it so clear and

evident, that, instead of extending pro­

tection (a) to the empire, it was their

awful pleasure to let fall their vengeance

on the crimes of an offending people. .
