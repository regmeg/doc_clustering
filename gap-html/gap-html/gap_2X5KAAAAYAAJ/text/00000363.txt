media salutantium turbd apprehendit, jiliumque appel-

lans, perduxit in castra, ac pro condone adoptavit.

Suet, in Galba, s. 17. According to this account,

Galba was determined in his choice, and did not want

the advice of Laco. He adopted Piso from inclination,

propria electione. Plutarch, in the Life of Galba,

gives the same account. For an account of Piso's pe­

digree, see Brotier, 4to edition, vol. iii. page 365.

(b) Piso's father, mother, and brother were put to

. death by Claudius. Another brother (the conspiracy

against Nero being detected) opened his veins and bled to
