362 NOTES ON THE •

Section LXV.

(a) For the animosity that subsisted between the

people of Lugdununi (Lyons) and the city of Vienne,

see the Appendix to Annals, xvi; and for Vienne, see

the Geographical Table at the end of the Eighth Volume.

(I) The people of Lyons waged war against Vindex,

and on that account Galba made them feel his resent­

ment.

(c) The cities of Lyons and Vienne were separated

by the river Rhodanus; now the Rhone.

(d) The people of Vienne favoured the revolt of

Vindex. See the Appendix to Annals, xvi.

Section LXVI.

(a) Olive branches and sacred vestments were usually

displayed in cases of distress, when the conquered sued

for mercy. So we read in Livy : Ramos olece ac vela-

menta supplicum porrigenfes, orare, ut reciperent sese,

rcceptosque tutarentur. Livy, lib. xxiv. s. 30.

Section LXVII.

(a) The territory of the Helvetii was a part of Celtic

Gaul, more extensive than what is now called Switzer­

land. The people are celebrated by Julius Cassar for

their military virtue, and constant warfare with the

Germans. Helvetii reliquos Gallos virtute prcecedunt,

quod fere quotidianis prceliis cum Germanis contendant,

cum avt suis finibi/s eos prohilent, aid ipsi in eorum

Jinilus lellwn gerunt. Caesar Bell. Gall. lib. i. s. l.

(b) Brotier says, this place was called in antient in­

scriptions, Respublica aquensis, on account of the salu­

brity of the waters. He supposes it to be what is now

called Baden, in the territory of Switzerland.
