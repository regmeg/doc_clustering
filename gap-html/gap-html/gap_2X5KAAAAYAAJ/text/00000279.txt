rous armies, and to bear the superadded ",

grievances of riot, insult, and devastation.

LVII. Vitellius, in the mean time,

advanced towards Italy with the remain­

der of the German armies, ignorant of his

victory, and still conceiving that he was

to meet the whole weight of the war. A

few of the veteran soldiers were left be­

hind in winter quarters; and to recruit

the legions, which retained little more

than their name, hasty levies were made in

Gaul. On the frontiers bordering on the

Rhine the command was given to Hordeo-

* nius Flaccus. To his own army Vitellius  
added eidit thousand men from Britain.

Having marched a few days, he received

intelligence of the victory at Bedriacum,

and the conclusion of the war by the

death of Otho. He called an assembly of

the soldiers, and, in a public harangue,

extolled the valour of the troops that con*

quered in his service. He had with him

a freedman of the name of Asiaticus (a).
