W Tacitus. 319

victed of forgery (a) in the reign of Nero, book

remained obnoxious to the laws, till,

among the evils that spring from civil

dissension, he rose from infamy to his

senatorian rank. He was advanced by

Galba to the command of the seventh

legion, and, according to report, offered

himself to Otho, desiring, by letters, the

rank of general against his benefactor.

Otho paid no attention to the proposal,

and, by consequence, Antonius remained

inactive. In the present juncture, seeing

a storm ready to burst upon Vitellius, he

.veered round to Vespasian, and became

the grand support of the party. To his

vices he united great and useful qualities;

brave and valiant, he possessed uncom­

mon eloquence; an artful and insidious

enemv, he had the art of involving; others

in danger; in popular insurrections, a

bold and turbulent leader; at once a

plunderer and a prodigal, what he gained

by rapine he squandered in corruption ;

during the calm season of peace, a per­

nicious citizen; in war, an officer not to

be neglected.
