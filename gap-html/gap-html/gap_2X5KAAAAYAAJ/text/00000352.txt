344 THE HISTORY

book the army. • Having thus secured in his

own hands the whole command, he or­

dered the legions to proceed by rapid

marches to Cremona, while a large de­

tachment went forward to Hostilia (&).

He himself turned off towards Ravenna,

under a pretence of conferring with the

officers of the fleet, but, in fact, with a

design to make the best of his way to the

city of Pavia, judging that place the fittest

for a treasonable convention. He there

met Lucilius Bassus (c), a man, who, from

a squadron of horse, had been raised by

Vitellius to the command of two fleets,

one at Ravenna, and the other at Mise-

num. Not content with that sudden rise,

he thought himself entitled to be made

praefect of the praetorian guards, That

disappointment he considered as an in­

jury, and therefore resolved to gratify his

unjust resentment by a stroke of perfi­

dy. For this purpose he joined Caecina.

Which seduced the other cannot now be

known. Two evil minds might form the

same black design, and, having formed it,

they would find in congenial qualities a

secret impulse to each other.
