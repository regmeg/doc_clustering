350 NOTES ON THE

reign A. U. C. 849, and died in the year 851, when

Trajan succeeded by adoption.

Section II.

(a) The history included the whole time from the

first of Galba to the assassination of Domitian; and, for

that reason, some of the commentators are of opinion

that the four princes put to the sword are Galba, Otho,

Vitellius, and Domitian. Others, observing that the

whole of Domitian's reign is lost, adapt their notions to

the present state of our author's work, and reckon Piso,

who was adopted by Galba, one of the four murdered

princes.

(6) The insurrection against Galba was an act of sud­

lost. All that can be collected at present is, that Anto­

nius, who commanded the legions on the Upper Rhine,

formed a league with some of the German nations, and

declared war against Domitian. He hazarded a battle

with Lucius Maximus, and met with a total overthrow.

He was slain in the engagement. Suet, in Domitian.

s. vi. The foreign wars that distracted the empire, du­

ring the rage of civil commotions, were, one in Judaea,

and the other with Civilis, the Batavian chief.

(e) Britain was finally subdued in the reign of Domi­

tian. See the Life of Agricola. It was afterwards neg­

lected and almost lost.
