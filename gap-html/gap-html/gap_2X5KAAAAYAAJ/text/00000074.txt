" by a few incendiaries, and hurried away

" to a camp, where no plan is settled; but

" And shall we linger here in cold debate,

" till the usurper, having mastered the

" camp, conies forth to invade the forum,

" and, under the eye of a lawful prince,

" ascends the capitol ? In the mean time,

" must our valiant emperor remain trem-

" friends barricade the doors, preparing,

" with heroic resolution, to stand a siege ?

" But, it seems, the slaves are to be arroÂ­

wed; and they, no doubt, will render

" effectual service, especially if we neg-

" lect the people now ready to support

" our cause, and suffer their indignation
