(a) M. Valerius Trachalus was joint consul with

Silius Italicus, A. U. G. 821. See Appendix to AnÂ­

nals, xvi.

(b) Gtho left the city of Rome on the 24th day of

March, as appears from Suetonius, who mentions his

neglect of the institutions relating to the Ancilia, as an

inauspicious beginning of the war. Suetoniu3 adds,

that he set out on the day when all who paid their

worship to the mother of the gods began the usual

ceremonies. Now that day was the gth of the kalends

of April, which answers to the 24th of March. See

Suetonius, Life of Otho, s. 8.
