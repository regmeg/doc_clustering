rions to tamper with the Moors, and draw

them over to the interest of Vitellius. This

was not a difficult task. The fame of the

German armies resounded through all the

provinces. A report prevailed, at the same

time, that Albinus, disdaining the title of

procurator, had usurped the regal dia足

dem, and the name of Juba.

commanded a squadron of horse in that

country, and professed himself devoted

to Albinus, was immediately murdered.
