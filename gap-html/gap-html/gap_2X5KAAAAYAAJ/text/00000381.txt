29. Legio Undevicessima, the nineteenth legion,

another legion under Varus.

30. Legio Vicessima, the twentieth legion, called

byDio Valeria Victrix.

31. Legio Una-et-vicessima, the twenty-first le­

gion, sometimes with the addition of Rapax.

32. Legio Duo-et-vicessima, the twenty-second

legion, stationed in Germany.

33. Legio Duo-et-vicessima, another twenty-se­

cond legion, quartered in iEgypt.

34. Legio e Classicis, a legion formed out of the

marine soldiers by Vitellius in his last distress, but soon

received into Vespasian's party, and never more distin­

guished.

Such were the names of the legions that occur in Ta­

citus. If, from the whole number, we deduct the seven­

teenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth, which were all cut

off under Varus, and also the last, formed out of the ma­

rines by Vitellius, and heard of no more, it will appear

that, in the beginning of the ensuing wars, the military

establishment, exclusive of the forces in Italy, consisted

of Thirty Legions. Their stations were as follows:

, In Britain. .

The second, ninth, twentieth.
