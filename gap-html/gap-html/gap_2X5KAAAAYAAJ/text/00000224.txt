216' THE HISTORY

book solved to raise the siege, and leave a camp,

where he had nothing to expect but reÂ­

proach and shame. He repassed the Po,

and bent his inarch towards Cremona.

He had not proceeded far, when he was

joined by Turullius Cerealis, a centurion

of principal rank, who had served under

him in Germany, and also by Julius Bri-

ganticus, a Batavian by birth: the former

deserted with a strong body of marine

soldiers, and the latter, with a small party

of horse.

XXHI. Spurinna, as soon as he was

informed of the movements of the enemy,

sent dispatches to Annius Gall us, with the

particulars of the siege, the gallant defence

of Placentia, and the measures concerted

by Caecina. Galius was then on his march,

at the head of the first legion, to the relief

of the place, little imagining that a few

cohorts would be able to hold out against

the strength and valour of the German

army. It was, however, no sooner known

that Caecina had abandoned his enterprise,

and was then proceeding to Cremona, than

the spirit of the legion blazed out at once.
