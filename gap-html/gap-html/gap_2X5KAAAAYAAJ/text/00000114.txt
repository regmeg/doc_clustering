without further delay. A report soon pre­

vailed that they were all treacherously

murdered, and that, if the soldiers did

of a design to rise against the legions, and

put the whole body to the sword, entered

into the league with eager ardour. Such

is the nature of profligate and abandoned

minds: inpeace and profound tranquillity,

they seldom agree; but for seditious pur-i

poses a coalition is easily formed.

on the calends of January, went through

the usual form of swearing fidelity to

Galba; but the form only was observed.
